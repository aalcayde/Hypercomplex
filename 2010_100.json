An important contribution of this work consists of a new formulation of three different clustering algorithms at three different levels. In the first level, a multiclass clustering algorithm using binary quaternion moment preserving thresholding algorithm is applied in order to quantize the colors. In the second level, clustering is performed on the quantized image using Self-organizing map for the estimation of the optimal number of components in the image and to resolve the initialization problem of mixture model based clustering which is carried out in the third level. The clusters obtained in the second level are then, refined and modelled using an adaptive spatial finite mixture model in the color-texture feature space. Since the dimensionality and the complexity of the image space is reduced at every level the proposed algorithm is fast and efficient. The proposed algorithm is applied on the Berkeley database images and complex natural images. The results are competent with the JSEG and CTex algorithms.

If there are inaccuracies in the camera calibration, then performance degradation and potentially unpredictable response from the visual servo control system may occur. Motivated by the desire to incorporate robustness to the camera calibration, different control methods have been developed. Previous adaptive/robust controllers (especially for six degree-of-freedom camera motion) rely heavily on properties of the rotation parameterization to formulate state estimates and a measurable closed-loop error system. All of these results are based on the singular axis-angle parameterization. Motivated by the desire to express the rotation by a non-singular parameterization, efforts in this paper address the question: Can state estimates and a measurable closed-loop error system be crafted in terms of the quaternion parameterization when the camera calibration parameters are unknown? To answer this question, a contribution of this paper is the development of a robust controller and closed-loop error system based on a new quaternion-based estimate of the rotation error. A Lyapunov-based analysis is provided which indicates that the controller yields asymptotic regulation of the rotation and translation error signals given a sufficient approximate of the camera calibration parameters. Simulation results are provided that illustrate the performance of the controller for a range of calibration uncertainty.

The objective of this study was to use a small portion of uncorrelated singular values, as robust features for the classification of sliced pork ham images, using a supervised artificial neural network classifier. Images were acquired from four qualities of sliced cooked pork ham typically consumed in Ireland (90 slices per quality), having similar appearances. Mahalanobis distances and Pearson product moment correlations were used for feature selection. Six highly discriminating features were used as input to train the neural network. An adaptive feedforward multilayer perceptron classifier was employed to obtain a suitable mapping from the input dataset. The overall correct classification performance for the training, validation and test set were 90.3%, 94.4%, and 86.1%, respectively. The results confirm that the classification performance was satisfactory. Extracting the most informative features led to the recognition of a set of different but visually quite similar textural patterns based on quaternionic singular values. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Firstly the quaternion is used to describe the attitude of the image, and then spherical linear interpolation is used to gain the attitude of any line in this algorithm, lastly a model of exterior orientation elements is build and is used in exterior orientation.

This semigroup contains the semigroup Î²(X) of ultrafilters as a closed subsemigroup. We construct a faithful representation of the semigroup Î»(X) in the semigroup P(X)P(X) of all self-maps of the power-set P(X) and show that the image of Î»(X) in P(X)P(X) coincides with the semigroup EndÎ»(P(X)) of all functions f: P(X)âP(X) that are equivariant, monotone and symmetric in the sense that f (X \\A) = X \\f(A) for all AâX. Using this representation we describe the minimal ideal K(Î»(X)) and minimal left ideals of the superextension Î»(X) of a twinic group X. A group X is called twinic if it admits a left- invariant ideal IâP(X) such that xA =I y A for all subsets AâX and points x,yâX with xAâ X\\AâI yA. The class of twinic groups includes all amenable groups and all groups with periodic commutators but does not include the free group F2 with two generators. We prove that for any twinic group X, there is a cardinal m such that all minimal left ideals of Î»(X) are algebraically isomorphic to for some cardinals q(X, C2k) and q(X, Q2k), kâN âª{â}. Here C2k is the cyclic group of order 2k, C2â is the quasicyclic 2-group and Q2k, kâN âª{â}, are the groups of generalized quaternions. If the group X is abelian, then q(X, Q2k) = 0 for all k and q(X, C2k) is the number of subgroups HâX with quotient X|H isomorphic to C2k. If X is an abelian group (admitting no epimorphism onto C2â), then each minimal left ideal of the superextension Î»(X) is algebraically (and topologically) isomorphic to the product where the cube 22k-1-k (equal to 2Ï if k = â) is endowed with the left zero multiplication. For an abelian group X, all minimal left ideals of Î»(X) are metrizable if and only if X has finite ranks r0(X) and r2(X) and admits no homomorphism onto the group C2ââC2â. Applying this result to the group â¤ of integers, we prove that each minimal left ideal of Î»(â¤) is topologically isomorphic to. Consequently, all subgroups in the minimal ideal K(Î»(â¤)) of Î»(â¤) are profinite abelian groups. On the other hand, the superextension Î»(â¤)contains an isomorphic topological copy of each second countable profinite topological semigroup. This results contrasts with the famous Zelenyuk Theorem saying that the semigroup Î²(â¤) contains no finite subgroups. At the end of the paper we describe the structure of minimal left ideals of finite groups X of order |X|â¤15.","citedby-count":"18","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60080759","afid":"60080759","affilname":"Ivan Franko National University of Lviv","affiliation-city":"Lviv","affiliation-country":"Ukraine"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030302","afid":"60030302","affilname":"Jan Kochanowski University, Kielce","affiliation-city":"Kielce","affiliation-country":"Poland"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018265","afid":"60018265","affilname":"Vasyl Stefanyk Precarpathian National University","affiliation-city":"Ivano-Frankivsk","affiliation-country":"Ukraine"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701315535","authid":"6701315535","authname":"Banakh T.","surname":"Banakh","given-name":"Taras","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60080759"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030302"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55135818700","authid":"55135818700","authname":"Gavrylkiv V.","surname":"Gavrylkiv","given-name":"Volodymyr","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018265"}]}],"authkeywords":"Compact right-topological semigroup | Faithful representation | Minimal ideal | Minimal idempotent | Minimal left ideal | Semigroup of maximal linked systems | Superextension of a group | Twin set | Twinic group | Wreath product","source-id":"21100199568","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/78049357950"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/78049357950?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=78049357950&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=78049357950&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/78049357950","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:78049357950","eid":"2-s2.0-78049357950","dc:title":"Quaternionic wavelets for texture classification","dc:creator":"Soulard R.","prism:publicationName":"ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - Proceedings","prism:issn":"15206149","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781424442966"}],"prism:pageRange":"4134-4137","prism:coverDate":"2010-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2010","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2010.5495732","dc:description":"This paper proposes a new texture classifier based on the Quaternionic Wavelet Transform (QWT). This recent transform separates the informations contained in the image better than a classical wavelet transform (DWT), and provides a multiscale image analysis which coefficients are 2D analytic, with one near-shift invariant magnitude and a phase, that is made of three angles.

Ultrasound imaging associated with Doppler methods is often used for blood flow evaluation. However, Doppler methods suffer from shortcomings such as limited spatial resolution and the inability to estimate lateral motion. Numerous methods such as block matching and decorrelation-based techniques have been proposed to overcome these limitations. In this paper, we propose an original method to estimate dense fields of vector velocity from ultrasound image sequences. Our proposal is based on a spatiotemporal approach and considers 2D+t data as a 3D volume. Orientation of the texture within this volume is related to velocity. Thus, we designed a bank of 3D quaternionic filters to estimate local orientation and then calculate local velocities. The method was applied to a large set of experimental and simulated flow sequences with low motion (â 1mm/s) within small vessels (â1mm). Evaluation was conducted with several quantitative criteria such as the normalized mean error or the estimated mean velocity. The results obtained show the good behaviour of our method, characterizing the flows studied.

However, registration of cardiac functional datasets acquired on different imaging systems is limited by the difficulty to define anatomical landmarks and by the relatively poor inherent spatial resolution. In this article, the authors sought to evaluate whether it is possible to automatically register FDG-PET and sestamibi-SPECT cardiac data. Methods: Automatic rigid registration was implemented with the ITK framework using Mattes mutual information as the similarity measure and a quaternion to represent the rotational component. The goodness of the alignment was evaluated by computing the mean target registration error (mTRE) at the myocardial wall. The registration parameters were optimized for robustness and speed using the data from 11 cardiac patients undergoing both PET and SPECT examinations (training datasets). The optimized algorithm was applied on the PET and SPECT data from 11 further patients (evaluation datasets). Quantitative (mTRE calculation) and visual (scoring method) comparisons were performed between automatic and manual registrations. Moreover, the automatic registration was also compared to the registration implicitly defined in the standard clinical analysis. Results: The registration parameters were successfully optimized and resulted in a mean mTRE of 1.13 mm and 1.2 s average runtime on standard computer hardware for the training datasets. Automatic registration in the 11 validation datasets resulted in an average mTRE of 2.3 mm, with 7.5 mm mTRE in the worst case and an average runtime of 1.6 s. Automatic registration outperformed manual registrations both for the mTRE and for the visual assessment. Automatic registration also resulted in higher accuracy and better visual assessment as compared to the registration implicitly performed in the standard clinical analysis. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the possibility to successfully perform mutual information based registration of PET and SPECT cardiac data, allowing an improved workflow for the sequentially acquired cardiac datasets, in general, and specifically for the assessment of myocardial viability.

paper presents the application of the proposed autopilot and navigation system to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The autopilot is based on fuzzy control and the navigation system is composed of a single antenna global positioning system (GPS) and gyroscopes, which implies that no other inertial navigation system (INS) is needed for this system. The autopilot consists of four fuzzy logic controllers, which control the altitude, pitch, heading, and roll respectively, and it is capable of performing waypoint navigation and trajectory following. The navigation system supplies the position and the estimated attitude of the aircraft. The estimated attitude is fused from the angular rates measured by the gyroscopes and the pseudo-attitude derived from the GPS velocity solution, and this fusion is via the quaternion-based extended Kalman filter (EKF). Ultimately, the feasibility and performance of the resulting autopilot and navigation system are verified through flight simulation of the SP-80 UAV. The simulation results demonstrate the successful autonomous flight of this UAV, using the autopilot and navigation system, even under the influence of wind disturbance.

A color image must be first converted to a grayscale one before performing the POC, during which the chrominance information is wasted. The conventional POC technique is extended to the quaternion field (QPOC), and a subpixel color image registration algorithm based on the QPOC is proposed. The proposed algorithm can not only naturally make full use of the luminance as well as the chrominance information in color images, but also directly estimate the subpixel translational shift from the 2D data array of the QPOC function. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009860","afid":"60009860","affilname":"Fudan University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57199807876","authid":"57199807876","authname":"Feng W.","surname":"Feng","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009860"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56969610100","authid":"56969610100","authname":"Hu B.","surname":"Hu","given-name":"Bo","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009860"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image registration | Least square | Phase-only correlation | Quaternion phase-only correlation","source-id":"15141","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/73249141020"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/73249141020?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=73249141020&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=73249141020&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/73249141020","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:73249141020","eid":"2-s2.0-73249141020","dc:title":"Adaptive homography-based visual servo tracking control via a quaternion formulation","dc:creator":"Hu G.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","prism:issn":"10636536","prism:volume":"18","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"128-135","prism:coverDate":"2010-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"January 2010","prism:doi":"10.1109/TCST.2008.2009227","dc:description":"In this paper, an adaptive homography-based visual servo tracking controller is developed for the camera-in-hand problem using a quaternion formulation to represent rotation tracking error. The desired trajectory in the tracking problem is encoded by a sequence of images (e.g., a video sequence), and Lyapunov methods are employed to facilitate the control design and the stability analysis. An adaptive estimation law is designed to compensate for the lack of unknown depth information. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the visual servo tracking controller.
