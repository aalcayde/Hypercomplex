The watermark data are embedded into some proper hypercomplex frequency components and their corresponding HFT coefficients are modified to fulfill the symmetry constraint. The prerequisite, the watermarked host image in spatial domain should also be transferred in red, green, and blue channels, of embedding watermark data into the hypercomplex frequency domain is obtained. The analytical results show that the image distortions from the watermark are spread throughout the whole image and are spread into the three channels of a color host image by a hypercomplex inverse Fourier transform. So the proposed watermarking algorithm can realize a good combination for the imperceptibility and security of the watermark. Moreover a cross redundancy embedding rule is also proposed to improve watermarking robustness further. Experimental results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009860","afid":"60009860","affilname":"Fudan University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14619404200","authid":"14619404200","authname":"Jiang S.H.","surname":"Jiang","given-name":"Shu Hong","initials":"S.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009860"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221655967","authid":"57221655967","authname":"Zhang J.Q.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Jian Qiu","initials":"J.Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009860"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56969610100","authid":"56969610100","authname":"Hu B.","surname":"Hu","given-name":"Bo","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009860"}]}],"authkeywords":"Digital watermarking | Hypercomplex | Hypercomplex Fourier transform","source-id":"15141","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70350576848"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70350576848?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=70350576848&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=70350576848&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70350576848","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:70350576848","eid":"2-s2.0-70350576848","dc:title":"Multi-parameter estimation of harmonics based on quaternion matrix","dc:creator":"Wang F.","prism:publicationName":"Xi Tong Gong Cheng Yu Dian Zi Ji Shu/Systems Engineering and Electronics","prism:issn":"1001506X","prism:volume":"31","prism:issueIdentifier":"9","prism:pageRange":"2037-2041","prism:coverDate":"2009-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"September 2009","dc:description":"As for harmonic multiple parameter estimation used in many applications, this paper presents a novel estimation algorithm based on quaternion theory.

After analyzing the Toeplitz matrix, the following nuclear purpose is to establish mutual constraint between multiple parameters so as to improve estimation effects. Finally, with right eigenvalue decomposition of the quaternion matrix, its noise subspace is constructed, and a quaternion-MUSIC method is used to estimate harmonic's multiple parameters.

Considering the straight outline feature of the uncooperative target as observed object and using the dual quaternion to describe the relative transition and attitude motion, the paper establishes the camera observed model and target motion model. With these models and take the parameters of target, including transition, attitude, inertia ratio, as the state variables, the system state equation and observed equation which are suitable for the IEKF are deduced. The state information updates iteratively in one filter period is the advantage of IEKF, which can be used to reduce the error of the observed equation linearization and ensue the stability of the whole estimation algorithm. Finally, a simulation is carried out and the results indicate that the algorithm can be used on-orbit to estimate the real time parameters of out-of-control target spacecraft.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55740480600","authid":"55740480600","authname":"Wang F.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Feng","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8399223600","authid":"8399223600","authname":"Chen X.Q.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Xue Qin","initials":"X.Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35101618800","authid":"35101618800","authname":"Cao X.B.","surname":"Cao","given-name":"Xi Bin","initials":"X.B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]}],"authkeywords":"Aircraft designing | On-orbit-servicing | Out-of-control spacecraft | Parameter estimation | Relative motion","source-id":"13628","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/68049101282"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/68049101282?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=68049101282&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=68049101282&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/68049101282","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:68049101282","eid":"2-s2.0-68049101282","dc:title":"Attitude determination of the 5-DoF air-bearing testbed aided by computer vision","dc:creator":"Xu J.","prism:publicationName":"Sichuan Daxue Xuebao (Gongcheng Kexue Ban)/Journal of Sichuan University (Engineering Science Edition)","prism:issn":"10093087","prism:volume":"41","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"220-226","prism:coverDate":"2009-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2009","dc:description":"An attitude determination system consisted of monocular computer vision, triaxial fiber optic gyroscope and two-axis inclinometer is presented, which aims to meet the demand of the five degrees of freedom air-bearing testbed according to actual situation.

The neurophysiology of small-target motion detectors (STMDs) underlying these complex behaviors has recently been described and suggests that insects use mechanisms similar to those of hypercomplex cells of the mammalian visual cortex to achieve target-specific tuning. Cortical hypercomplex cells are end-stopped, which means that they respond optimally to small moving targets, with responses to extended bars attenuated. We review not only the underlying mechanisms involved in this tuning but also how recently proposed models provide a possible explanation for another remarkable property of these neurons - their ability to respond robustly to the motion of targets even against moving backgrounds.

The magnitude of distortion in orientation in a standard equipped motion lab and its effect on the accuracy of the orientation estimation with IMU's is addressed. Methods: Orientations of the earth magnetic field vectors were expressed in the laboratory's reference frame. The effect of a distorted earth magnetic field on orientation estimation with IMU's (using both a quaternion and a Kalman fusing algorithm) was compared to orientations derived from an optical system. Findings: The magnetic field varied considerably, with the strongest effects at 5 cm above floor level with a standard deviation in heading of 29°, decreasing to 3° at levels higher than 100 cm. Orientation estimation was poor with the quaternion filter, for the Kalman filter results were acceptable, despite a systematic deterioration over time (after 20-30 s). Interpretation: Distortion of the earth magnetic field is depending on construction materials used in the building, and should be taken into account for calibration, alignment to a reference system, and further measurements. Mapping the measurement volume to determine its ferromagnetic characteristics in advance of planned experiments can be the rescue of the data set. Conclusions: To obtain valid data, \"mapping\" of the laboratory is essential, although less critical with the Kalman filter and at larger distances (>100 cm) from suspect materials. Measurements should start in a \"safe\" area and continue no longer than 20-30 s in a heavily distorted earth magnetic field. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

While the vehicle carrying the optical instrumentation is in motion, a PAT system is required to compensate for the vibrations applied to the optical platform through the proper application of advanced control laws. This paper presents a feedforward vibration rejection system interacting with an optical tracking system to successfully perform the PAT task. It features a set of inertial navigation sensors to monitor the optical platform orientation, and the optical tracker monitoring the optical alignment errors.

The proposed optimizer uses a Gauss Newton (G-N) method for finding the best-fit quaternion. In order to decrease the computing time, the optimizer is formulated using a virtual rotation concept that allows very fast quaternion updates compared to the conventional G-N method. In addition, to guard against the effects of fast bodymotions and temporary ferromagnetic disturbances, a situational measurement vector selection procedure is adopted in conjunction with the G-N optimizer.

One limitation for exploiting Drosophila as a model system for behavioral neurobiology is that measuring body kinematics during behavior is labor intensive and subjective. In order to quantify flight kinematics during different types of maneuvers, we have developed a visual tracking system that estimates the posture of the fly from multiple calibrated cameras. An accurate geometric fly model is designed using unit quaternions to capture complex body and wing rotations, which are automatically fitted to the images in each time frame. Our approach works across a range of flight behaviors, while also being robust to common environmental clutter. The tracking system is used in this paper to compare wing and body motion during both voluntary and escape take-offs. Using our automated algorithms, we are able to measure stroke amplitude, geometric angle of attack and other parameters important to a mechanistic understanding of flapping flight. When compared with manual tracking methods, the algorithm estimates body position within 4.4±1.3% of the body length, while body orientation is measured within 6.5±1.9deg. (roll), 3.2±1.3deg. (pitch) and 3.4±1.6deg. (yaw) on average across six videos. Similarly, stroke amplitude and deviation are estimated within 3.3 deg. and 2.1 deg., while angle of attack is typically measured within 8.8deg. comparing against a human digitizer. Using our automated tracker, we analyzed a total of eight voluntary and two escape take-offs. These sequences show that Drosophila melanogaster do not utilize clap and fling during take-off and are able to modify their wing kinematics from one wingstroke to the next. Our approach should enable biomechanists and ethologists to process much larger datasets than possible at present and, therefore, accelerate insight into the mechanisms of free-flight maneuvers of flying insects.","citedby-count":"81","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031581","afid":"60031581","affilname":"California Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Pasadena","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"pubmed-id":"19376952","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7007029284","authid":"7007029284","authname":"Fontaine E.I.","surname":"Fontaine","given-name":"Ebraheem I.","initials":"E.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031581"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57220324305","authid":"57220324305","authname":"Zabala F.","surname":"Zabala","given-name":"Francisco","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031581"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102926772","authid":"7102926772","authname":"Dickinson M.H.","surname":"Dickinson","given-name":"Michael H.","initials":"M.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031581"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7103361644","authid":"7103361644","authname":"Burdick J.W.","surname":"Burdick","given-name":"Joel W.","initials":"J.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031581"}]}],"authkeywords":"Drosophila | Escape response | Estimation | Flight | Geometric modeling | Tracking","source-id":"29605","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/58249092009"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/58249092009?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=58249092009&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=58249092009&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0031320308004123"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/58249092009","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:58249092009","eid":"2-s2.0-58249092009","dc:title":"Improved bi-dimensional EMD and Hilbert spectrum for the analysis of textures","dc:creator":"Guanlei X.","prism:publicationName":"Pattern Recognition","prism:issn":"00313203","prism:volume":"42","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"718-734","prism:coverDate":"2009-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May 2009","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.patcog.2008.09.017","pii":"S0031320308004123","dc:description":"An improved bi-dimensional empirical mode decomposition (IBEMD) is proposed. Structure of image extremas represents the important feature of images, and is useful for the information extraction and analysis. The image extrema are classified into the five different sets, which are called as the structural extrema. The structural extrema are used instead of the classical extrema, and the BEMD (bi-dimensional empirical mode decomposition) algorithms based on the structural extrema are more accurate through interpolating the up and down envelopes. Specially, the IBEMD has the least NMSE (normalised mean square error) and the biggest SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) for the mode decomposition, and greatly improves the robustness of the BEMD. Moreover, quaternion Hilbert transform based space-spatial-frequency tool is improved, and applied to the texture analysis. The experiments of texture analysis show that the new approach is efficient for the application in texture analysis. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

These processes exhibit complex nonlinear dynamics and coupling between the dimensions, which make their component-wise processing by multiple univariate LMS, bivariate complex LMS (CLMS), or multichannel LMS (MLMS) algorithms inadequate. The QLMS accounts for these problems naturally, as it is derived directly in the quaternion domain. The analysis shows that QLMS operates inherently based on the so called \"augmented\" statistics, that is, both the covariance E{xxH} and pseudocovariance E{xxT} of the tap input vector x are taken into account. In addition, the operation in the quaternion domain facilitates fusion of heterogeneous data sources, for instance, the three vector dimensions of the wind field and air temperature. Simulations on both benchmark and real world data support the approach. © 2009 IEEE.","citedby-count":"249","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015150","afid":"60015150","affilname":"Imperial College London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57829404900","authid":"57829404900","authname":"Took C.C.","surname":"Took","given-name":"Clive Cheong","initials":"C.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006513328","authid":"7006513328","authname":"Mandic D.P.","surname":"Mandic","given-name":"Danilo P.","initials":"D.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive multistep ahead prediction | Data fusion via vector spaces | Multidimensional adaptive filters | Quaternion signal processing | Wind modeling","source-id":"17391","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/67149099252"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/67149099252?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=67149099252&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=67149099252&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/67149099252","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:67149099252","eid":"2-s2.0-67149099252","dc:title":"Gravitational contributions to pioneer space probe decelerations and the time-delay-doppler \"relativistic Confusion\"","dc:creator":"Yefremov A.P.","prism:publicationName":"Gravitation and Cosmology","prism:issn":"02022893","prism:eIssn":"19950721","prism:volume":"15","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"121-128","prism:coverDate":"2009-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2009","prism:doi":"10.1134/S0202289309020030","dc:description":"Relativistic corrections to the calculations of Pioneer 10 space probe motion (mentioned but not sufficiently detailed by the authors of the observation [1]) are analyzed basing on the assumption that the Solar System gravity is described by the Kerr metric. The geodesic equation for ecliptic-plane motion of the space probe is solved, and all specific gravitational corrections to the probe acceleration are computed up to the 2nd order of the small parameters; values of all general-relativistic corrections are found to be small as compared to the Pioneer anomaly. On the contrary, a study of kinematic effects in the tangent space based on the Quaternion Relativity formalism (the quaternion square root of the Kerr space-time interval) shows that the probe's signal frequency distorted by relativistic time-scale stretching, when taken for a Doppler portion of the frequency shift, may result in experimental detection of an additional acceleration of the probe.

Attitude quaternion errors and drift bias of gyroscope were selected to construct a state vector, and the state equation was established based on attitude quaternion error differential equation and stochastic error model of gyroscope. The modified Gauss-Newton algorithm was used to convert the outputs of sensors to quaternion by which the measurements of Kalman filter were obtained through making combination of attitude quaternion from gyroscope signals, which significantly reduces the influences of maneuvering acceleration on attitude estimation. Experimental results show that the maximum estimated errors were less than 0.22% in static and the estimated quaternion could well track its true values dynamically. The algorithm is proved to be effective at improving the accuracy of attitude estimation.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003977","afid":"60003977","affilname":"Northwestern Polytechnical University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55683319900","authid":"55683319900","authname":"Xue L.","surname":"Xue","given-name":"Liang","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201519471","authid":"7201519471","authname":"Yuan W.","surname":"Yuan","given-name":"Wei Zheng","initials":"W.Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8657529000","authid":"8657529000","authname":"Chang H.","surname":"Chang","given-name":"Hong Long","initials":"H.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204325159","authid":"57204325159","authname":"Qin W.","surname":"Qin","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25959807000","authid":"25959807000","authname":"Yuan G.","surname":"Yuan","given-name":"Guang Min","initials":"G.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55587780500","authid":"55587780500","authname":"Jiang C.","surname":"Jiang","given-name":"Cheng Yu","initials":"C.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude estimation | Extended Kalman filter | Gauss-Newton | MEMS gyroscope | Quaternion","source-id":"4500151512","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/64049104443"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/64049104443?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=64049104443&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=64049104443&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/64049104443","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:64049104443","eid":"2-s2.0-64049104443","dc:title":"Residual error hypercomplex symplectic decomposition approach to multispectral and panchromatic image fusions","dc:creator":"Yang H.","prism:publicationName":"Hangkong Xuebao/Acta Aeronautica et Astronautica Sinica","prism:issn":"10006893","prism:volume":"30","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"490-496","prism:coverDate":"2009-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"March 2009","dc:description":"A residual error hypercomplex symplectic decomposition approach to multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) image fusion is presented.
