With a 15N-,13C-labeled human ubiquitin sample (1.0mM), high spectral resolution was obtained at 500MHz in 25min with only 6-8 increments in each of the CT dimensions. This data set size is about a factor of 50-100 smaller than typically required, yet FDM analysis results in a fully resolved spectrum with a sharp peak for each HNCO resonance. Unlike Fourier transform (FT) processing, in which spectral resolution in each dimension is inversely proportional to the acquisition time in this dimension, FDM is a true multi-dimensional method; the resolution in all dimensions is determined by the total information content of the entire signal. As the CT dimensions of the 3D HNCO signal have approximate time-reversal symmetry, they can each be doubled by combining the usual four hyper-complex data sets. This apparent quadrupling of the data is important to the success of the method. Thus, whenever raw sensitivity is not limiting, well-resolved n-dimensional spectra can now be obtained in a small fraction of the usual time. Alternatively, to maximize sensitivity, evolution periods of faster relaxing nuclei may be radically shortened, the total required resolution being obtained through chemical shift encoding of other, more slowly relaxing, spins. Improvements similar to those illustrated with a 3D HNCO spectrum are expected for other triple-resonance spectra, where CT evolution in the indirect dimensions is implemented. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Process and measurement models are developed based on these relations in order to implement them into an extended Kalman filter. The performances of each filter are evaluated in terms of the roll, pitch, and yaw angles.

The error of transformation directly reduces the precision of 3D reconstruction. In this study, we introduce the methods of 3D reconstruction, analyze the necessity of optimization of transformation, and define transformation by quaternion. Then bifurcations, vessel vectors and branch angles are employed to optimize the transformation, with Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The experimental results on the human angiogram data are presented. The Standard Deviation of reconstruction error reduces from 3.8573 mm to 1.0803 mm in image A and from 4.0663 mm to 1.0742 mm in image B respectively on clinical angiogram data.

The information from a small number of plane projections is used to recreate the full multidimensional spectrum in the familiar format. Projections at any desired angle of incidence are obtained by Fourier transformation of time-domain signals acquired when two or more evolution intervals are incremented simultaneously at different rates. The new technique relies on an established Fourier transform theorem that relates time-domain sections to frequency-domain projections. Recent developments in NMR instrumentation, such as increased resolution and sensitivity, make fast methods for data gathering much more practical for protein and RNA research. Hypercomplex Fourier transformation generates projections in symmetrically related pairs that provide two independent \"views\" of the spectrum. A new reconstruction algorithm is proposed, based on the inverse Radon transform. Examples are presented of three- and four-dimensional NMR spectra of nuclease A inhibitor reconstructed by this technique with significant savings in measurement time.","citedby-count":"220","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60099023","afid":"60099023","affilname":"Varian Limited, UK","affiliation-city":"Oxford","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012901","afid":"60012901","affilname":"Jesus College","affiliation-city":"Cambridge","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"pubmed-id":"15149240","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56244500200","authid":"56244500200","authname":"Kupče E.","surname":"Kupče","given-name":"Eriks","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60099023"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35575889600","authid":"35575889600","authname":"Freeman R.","surname":"Freeman","given-name":"Ray","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012901"}]}],"source-id":"22680","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/2942528890"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/2942528890?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=2942528890&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=2942528890&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/2942528890","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:2942528890","eid":"2-s2.0-2942528890","dc:title":"Quaternion based attitude estimation algorithm applied to signals from body-mounted gyroscopes","dc:creator":"Sabatini A.","prism:publicationName":"Electronics Letters","prism:issn":"00135194","prism:volume":"40","prism:issueIdentifier":"10","prism:pageRange":"584-586","prism:coverDate":"2004-05-13","prism:coverDisplayDate":"13 May 2004","prism:doi":"10.1049/el:20040401","dc:description":"An application of inertial sensing to gait analysis is described: the attitude estimation algorithm computes the attitude quaternion associated with a body part, i.e. the foot instep moving in the inertial space, by employing a spherical linear interpolation procedure to compensate for the errors due to the influence of the gyroscope bias.

We show that the virtual trackball by Chen et al. does not rotate the object along the intended great circular arc on the virtual trackball and we give a correction. Another popular virtual trackball is Shoemake's quaternion implementation, which we show to be a special case of the virtual trackball by Chen et al. Shoemake extends the scope of the virtual trackball to the full screen. Unfortunately, Shoemake's virtual trackball is inhomogeneous and discontinuous with consequences for usability. Finally, we review Bell's virtual trackball and discuss studies of the usability of virtual trackballs.","citedby-count":"36","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033202","afid":"60033202","affilname":"H.

The approach is based on spatially encoding the spins' evolution along the indirect domain with the aid of a magnetic field gradient, and subsequently decoding this information numerous times over the course of the signal acquisition while spins are subject to a train of gradient echoes. The present paper discusses further considerations pertaining the 2D line shapes arising from this new way of collecting NMR data. Specific issues that are hereby addressed include (i) the effects introduced by fast relaxation onto the spatial encoding process, particularly the line widths and line shapes that will then arise in the frequency domain; (ii) approaches capable of correcting for the mixed-phase kernels resulting in these fast-relaxation cases, corresponding in essence to spatially encoded analogs of the TPPI and hypercomplex time-domain acquisition procedures; (iii) the enveloping characteristics imposed by the use of discrete excitation pulses on the attainable spectral widths along the indirect domain; and (iv) an analysis of the signal-to-noise characteristics of the methodology, with experimental corroborations of theoretical predictions and an illustration of the method's capabilities to analyze protein solutions in the mM-range concentration. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

First, a multi-view face alignment algorithm localizes the face feature points, and then EM algorithm is applied to derive the optimal 3D shape and position parameters. Moreover, the unit quaternion based pose representation is proposed for efficient 3D pose parameter optimization. Compared with other related works, this framework has the following advantages: 1) it is fully automatic, and only one single face image in arbitrary view is required; 2) EM algorithm and unit quaternion based pose representation are integrated for efficient shape and position parameters estimation; 3) the correspondence between 2D contour points and 3D model vertexes are dynamically determined by normal direction constraints, which facilitates the 3D reconstruction from arbitrary view image; 4) a weighted optimization strategy is applied for more robust parameter estimation.

Unlike most existing approaches, we explicitly represent dependencies between the various degrees of freedom and derive these limits from actual experimental data. To this end, we use quaternions to represent individual 3 DOF joint rotations and Euler angles for 2 DOF rotations, which we have experimentally sampled using an optical motion capture system. Each set of valid positions is bounded by an implicit surface and we handle hierarchical dependencies by representing the space of valid configurations for a child joint as a function of the position of its parent joint. This representation provides us with a metric in the space of rotations that readily lets us determine whether a posture is valid or not. As a result, it becomes easy to incorporate these sophisticated constraints into a motion tracking algorithm, using standard constrained optimization techniques. We demonstrate this by showing that doing so dramatically improves performance of an existing system when attempting to track complex and ambiguous upper body motions from low quality stereo data. © Springer-Verlag 2001.","citedby-count":"18","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028186","afid":"60028186","affilname":"Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne","affiliation-city":"Lausanne","affiliation-country":"Switzerland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6506148710","authid":"6506148710","authname":"Herda L.","surname":"Herda","given-name":"Lorna","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028186"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58116197700","authid":"58116197700","authname":"Urtasun R.","surname":"Urtasun","given-name":"Raquel","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028186"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55159125200","authid":"55159125200","authname":"Fua P.","surname":"Fua","given-name":"Pascal","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028186"}]}],"source-id":"25674","fund-acr":"SNF","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/3242877538"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/3242877538?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=3242877538&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=3242877538&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/3242877538","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:3242877538","eid":"2-s2.0-3242877538","dc:title":"Pose and motion estimation from vision based on the first-order interpolation filter","dc:creator":"Wu X.","prism:publicationName":"Chinese Journal of Electronics","prism:issn":"10224653","prism:eIssn":"20755597","prism:volume":"13","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"526-531","prism:coverDate":"2004-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2004","dc:description":"Determination of relative three-dimensional (3D) position, orientation, and relative motion between two reference frames is an important problem in robotic guidance, manipulation, and assembly as well as in other fields such as photogrammetry.

The difficulty in performing this measurement is the process of projecting 3D object features to 2D images, a nonlinear transformation. Modeling the 3D transformation as a nonlinear stochastic system, and using a new set of filtering which are based on the first-order interpolation approximations of the nonlinear transformations as estimator, this paper presents solutions to the remote measurement problem given a sequence of 2D intensity images of an object.

Results show that those algorithms based on 3D give more precise, more stable and more efficient results than that based on 2D. Among 3 kinds of 3D-based algorithms, SVD is most efficient, meanwhile UQ is a little more stable than else. To \"8-point\", results show that the nonlinear optimization is effective.

The more important it becomes, the more automatism is required in order to increase the profit. This work describes the construction of an automatic classification system for plastic containers in domestic wastes. The system takes advantage of the different near infrared spectra from the plastics of economic interest. These spectra can be obtained very quickly by means of the acousto-optic tunable filter technology. Spectral data are processed on line by means of an algorithm based on wavelets to achieve a positive identification. Wavelets are chosen because of their noise immunity and their easy implementation. Once identified, the containers can be taken from the conveyor belt by using a pneumatic system. The algorithm uses the wavelet transform in order to obtain a coefficient set that characterizes the original signal with few data. Even with these reduced data the signal keeps enough information to be able to classify each type of plastic material. The coefficient set is used to construct a quaternion number. Using a calibration method, a standard quaternion is obtained for each type of plastic. A container can be classified by calculating the Euclidean distances among these standard quaternions and the measured quaternion of the container. © 2004 IOP Publishing Ltd.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028711","afid":"60028711","affilname":"Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia","affiliation-city":"Madrid","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005233","afid":"60005233","affilname":"Centro de Investigaciones Energeticas, Medioambientales y Tecnologicas","affiliation-city":"Madrid","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602451619","authid":"6602451619","authname":"Barcala J.M.","surname":"Barcala","given-name":"J.
