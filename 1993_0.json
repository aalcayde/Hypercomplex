Since the rotation of an object is an isometric transformation, a quaternion based representation if often preferred as it guarantees the orthonormality of the transformation matrix. Furthermore, the transcendental equation representing the motion is reduced to a much simpler algebraic one. The problem of recursively estimating the rotational parameters from a long sequence of data has been studied in the literature. However, only a fixed axis, constant velocity of an object was considered. We consider the motion of a rigid object rotating with respect to a known fixed axis, but with constant angular acceleration. We propose a very simple yet computationally efficient method of estimating the constant acceleration of the rotating object, given a long sequence of data from range or stereo images.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014153","afid":"60014153","affilname":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay","affiliation-city":"Mumbai","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402977965","authid":"7402977965","authname":"Chaudhuri S.","surname":"Chaudhuri","given-name":"Subhasis","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014153"}]}],"source-id":"77451","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85076007123"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85076007123?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85076007123&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85076007123&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85076007123","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85076007123","eid":"2-s2.0-85076007123","dc:title":"Stellar attitude determination accuracy with multiple star tracking advanced star tracker","dc:creator":"Abreu R.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","prism:issn":"0277786X","prism:eIssn":"1996756X","prism:volume":"1949","prism:pageRange":"216-227","prism:coverDate":"1993-10-23","prism:coverDisplayDate":"23 October 1993","prism:doi":"10.1117/12.157084","dc:description":"Inertially referenced attitude determination for pointing and control is a well established need which demands continual optimization.

The time-domain free-induction decay is modeled as a 2D signal f(t1, t2), the superposition of exponentially decaying complex exponentials in both dimensions of unknown amplitudes, frequencies, and decays. The measurement is modeled as a 2D Gaussian process with mean f(t1, t2) and fixed variance. The ML estimation problem is to choose the set of amplitudes, frequencies, and decays which minimizes the squared error between the measured FID and the parameterized signal model. An iterative expectation-maximization algorithm is proposed for solving the nonlinear least-squares problem, providing a method for estimating the signal parameters directly from the 2D FID. The ML method and implementation algorithm are tested by analyzing both simulated and experimental N-butanol data collected via the hypercomplex data-collection protocol.

Called the motion boundary contour system (BCS), the model clarifies how ambiguous local movements on a complex moving shape are actively reorganized into a coherent global motion signal, Unlike many previous researchers, we analyze how a coherent motion signal is imparted to all regions of a moving figure, not only to regions at which unambiguous motion signals exist. The model hereby suggests a solution to the global aperture problem. The motion BCS describes how preprocessing of motion signals by a motion oriented contrast (MOC) filter is joined to long-range cooperative grouping mechanisms in a motion cooperative-competitive (MOCC) loop to control phenomena such as motion capture. The motion BCS is computed in parallel with the static BCS of Grossberg and Mingolla (1985a, 1985b, 1987). Homologous properties of the motion BCS and the static BCS, specialized to process motion directions and static orientations, respectively, support a unified explanation of many data about static form perception and motion form perception that have heretofore been unexplained or treated separately. Predictions about microscopic computational differences of the parallel cortical streams V1 â MT and V1 â V2 â MT are made- notably, the magnocellular thick stripe and parvocellular interstripe streams. It is shown how the motion BCS can compute motion directions that may be synthesized from multiple orientations with opposite directions of contrast. Interactions of model simple cells, complex cells, hyper-complex cells, and bipole cells are described, with special emphasis given to new functional roles in direction disambiguation for endstopping at multiple processing stages and to the dynamic interplay of spatially short-range and long-range interactions.

Specifically, the first layer of the network extracts oriented textured elements, the second layer increases the sensitivity to texture differences and the last layer improves the selectivity of textural elements on the basis of their size.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025153","afid":"60025153","affilname":"UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Genova","affiliation-city":"Genoa","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005976319","authid":"7005976319","authname":"Bisio G.","surname":"Bisio","given-name":"Giacomo M.","initials":"G.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025153"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004012654","authid":"7004012654","authname":"Caviglia D.","surname":"Caviglia","given-name":"Daniele D.","initials":"D.D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025153"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003997439","authid":"7003997439","authname":"Indiveri G.","surname":"Indiveri","given-name":"Giacomo","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025153"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003651730","authid":"7003651730","authname":"Raffo L.","surname":"Raffo","given-name":"Luigi","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025153"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006560777","authid":"7006560777","authname":"Sabatini S.","surname":"Sabatini","given-name":"Silvio P.","initials":"S.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025153"}]}],"article-number":"298650","source-id":"110573","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/38249004975"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/38249004975?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=38249004975&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=38249004975&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-016786559390072L"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/38249004975","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:38249004975","eid":"2-s2.0-38249004975","dc:title":"Attitude estimation using moment invariants","dc:creator":"Mukundan R.","prism:publicationName":"Pattern Recognition Letters","prism:issn":"01678655","prism:volume":"14","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"199-205","prism:coverDate":"1993-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"March 1993","prism:doi":"10.1016/0167-8655(93)90072-L","pii":"0167-8655(93)90072-L","dc:description":"The problem of estimating the three-dimensional rotational parameters of a rigid body from its monocular image data has been considered using the method of moment invariants.

The camera rotation angle about the view axis is derived from second-order central moments.

Using a technique that combines the principles of the common axis theorem and quaternion mathematics, the projection directions may be determined a posteriori from the images. This technique is applied to stimulated electron micrographs of the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. These simulated images, with graded signal-to-noise ratios, are subjected to image processing procedures, such as 2D translational and rotational registration and multivariate statistical classification, that would normally be applied to electron micrographs to improve their quality. The alignment procedure is able to determine the relative 3D orientations of the projections correctly even when the images have an initial signal-to-noise ratio of 3.1 and when images within a single class of views are deliverately perturbed in orientation. A relationship is obtained between the parameters used to describe the success of the 3D alignment algorithm and the quality of the 3D reconstruction that might be expected.

This implies that all eye positions are confined to a plane when using a rotation vector or quaternion representation. The orientation of the angular velocity axis is crucial in order to preserve the law. For a single-axis rotation, the eye's angular velocity axis has to tilt out of Listing's plane, otherwise the law cannot be preserved in eccentric saccades. Experimental work has confirmed that normal, visually-guided saccades resemble single-axis rotations whose angular velocity axis tilts by the right amount. We investigated how well the saccadic system implements Listing's law when the trajectory of the eyes is more complicated, as in a non-single-axis rotation where the angular velocity vector depends on instantaneous eye position. Eye position was measured in three dimensions using the magnetic scleral search coil method for five subjects. Non-single-axis rotations of the eye were evoked with a double-step paradigm. We found that Listing's law is obeyed equally well during fixations, single-axis saccades and in non-single-axis saccades. Some deviations from the law were found in both curved and single-axis eye movements, but we demonstrated that the net torsional component of eye position of these saccades is negligible compared to that expected if the angular velocity axis did not tilt at all. In addition, analysis of the angular velocity signals in the curved movements showed strong similarity to the computed signal required for implementing Listing's law. Our results show that the observed deviations from Listing's law reflect only minor failures in the mechanism underlying its dynamic implementation. We conclude that single-axis rotations are not a necessary condition for the implementation of Listing's law in saccades. Our results are compatible with the notion that the implementation of Listing's law relies upon internal feedback. Various suggestions of how models can be reconciled with recent data on the three-dimensional control of saccades are discussed.

The model consists of a multistage system which extracts and groups salient features in the image at different spatial scales (or frequencies). In the first stage, a Gabor wavelet decomposition provides a representation of the image which is orientation selective and has optimal localization properties in space and frequency. This decomposition is useful in detecting significant features such as step and line edges at different scales and orientations in the image. Following the wavelet transformation, local competitive interactions are introduced which help in reducing the effects of noise and changes in illumination. Interscale interactions help in localizing the line ends and corners, and play a crucial role in boundary perception. The final stage groups similar features, aiding in boundary completion. This approach is consistent with some of the known neurophysiological observations regarding biological visual information processing, as the different stages can be identified with processing by simple, complex, and hypercomplex cells in the visual cortex of mammals. Experimental results are provided to indicate the performance of this model in detecting boundaries (both real and illusory) in real and synthetic images.

First we devise an error function and second we show how to minimize this error function. The quadratic nature of this function is made possible by representing rotation and translation with a dual number quaternion. We provide a detailed account of the computational aspects of a trust-region optimization method. This method compares favorably with Newton's method which has extensively been used to solve the problem at hand, with Faugeras-Toscani's linear method for calibrating a camera. Finally we present some experimental results which demonstrate the robustness of our method with respect to image noise and matching errors.","citedby-count":"17","prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6601968530","authid":"6601968530","authname":"Phong T.","surname":"Phong","given-name":"T.

The technique uses the algebraic manifolds that arise from the image space of spatial displacements to do trajectory analysis. The geometric structure of these manifolds offers a convenient framework to study robot motion. In this technique, the dynamics of the robot and the workpiece are formulated in the operational space of the robot. The position of the robot is written in the image space of dual quaternion coordinates. Thus, the analysis is performed in the operational image space. A planar example was chosen because the results can be demonstrated graphically. The algebraic properties of the constraint manifolds can be used to extend the work to more general, multi-dimensional spatial robot problems.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007278","afid":"60007278","affilname":"University of California, Irvine","affiliation-city":"Irvine","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56248589500","authid":"56248589500","authname":"Dooley J.","surname":"Dooley","given-name":"J.
