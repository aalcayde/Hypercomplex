The problem of designing fixed beamformers based on such an array, with a quaternionic signal model, is considered in this paper. Firstly, we consider the problem of designing the weight coefficients for a fixed set of vector-sensor locations. This can be achieved by minimising the sidelobe levels while keeping a unitary response for the main lobe. The second problem is then how to find a sparse set of sensor locations which can be efficiently used to implement a fixed beamformer. We propose solving this problem by converting the traditional l1 norm minimisation associated with compressive sensing into a modified l1 norm minimisation which simultaneously minimises all four parts of the quaternionic weight coefficients. Further improvements can be made in terms of sparsity by converting the problem into a series of iteratively solved reweighted minimisations, as well as being able to enforce a minimum spacing between active sensor locations. Design examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed design methods.","citedby-count":"15","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001881","afid":"60001881","affilname":"The University of Sheffield","affiliation-city":"Sheffield","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55203274500","authid":"55203274500","authname":"Hawes M.","surname":"Hawes","given-name":"Matthew","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001881"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56645219600","authid":"56645219600","authname":"Liu W.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001881"}]}],"article-number":"181937","source-id":"19700186861","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84927919434"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84927919434?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84927919434&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84927919434&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84927919434","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84927919434","eid":"2-s2.0-84927919434","dc:title":"Key image processing techniques used in laser welding","dc:creator":"Hua L.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Robotics and Mechatronics","prism:issn":"09153942","prism:eIssn":"18838049","prism:volume":"27","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"24-31","prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2015","prism:doi":"10.20965/jrm.2015.p0024","dc:description":"Machine vision techniques are widely used with automatic laser-welding robots.

The recognition of weld seams is thus obviously affected by the arc, plasma, spatter, etc. This study examined a novel, cost-effective weld image acquisition and processing system with real-time performance, which is based on an advanced RISC machine (ARM). The software and hardware platforms of a weld seam image processing system were designed, and theoretical and experimental studies were undertaken. A novel image-processing method for the laser welding molten pool, based on a quaternion and selforganizing feature map (SOFM) neural network is also proposed. The edge characteristic vector of the molten pool is acquired based on the rotational characteristic of the quaternion in a three-dimensional vector space. The geometric features of the molten pool image are acquired by the self-organizing feature map neural network. The measured results pointed to the possibility of improving the reliability and precision of the automatic laser welding system by combining the two machine vision systems.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021783","afid":"60021783","affilname":"Nantong University","affiliation-city":"Nantong","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35195975900","authid":"35195975900","authname":"Hua L.","surname":"Hua","given-name":"Liang","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021783"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36768806800","authid":"36768806800","authname":"Qiang Y.","surname":"Qiang","given-name":"Yujian","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021783"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192609061","authid":"57192609061","authname":"Chen L.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Ling","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021783"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55898232500","authid":"55898232500","authname":"Yao J.","surname":"Yao","given-name":"Juan","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021783"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56595837700","authid":"56595837700","authname":"Liu F.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Feipeng","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021783"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403129551","authid":"7403129551","authname":"Gu J.","surname":"Gu","given-name":"Juping","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021783"}]}],"authkeywords":"Embedded system | Laser welding | Quaternion | Self-organizing feature map neural network","source-id":"21100197345","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84926676690"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84926676690?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84926676690&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84926676690&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84926676690","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84926676690","eid":"2-s2.0-84926676690","dc:title":"A correction in feedback loop applied to two-axis gimbal stabilization","dc:creator":"Zych C.","prism:publicationName":"Bulletin of the Polish Academy of Sciences: Technical Sciences","prism:issn":"02397528","prism:volume":"63","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"217-219","prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2015","prism:doi":"10.1515/bpasts-2015-0025","dc:description":"A two-axis gimbal system can be used for stabilizing platform equipped with observation system like cameras or different measurement units.

The former is embedded in the real part of mid-frequency QDFT coefficients using quantization index modulation. The latter is used to resynchronize the watermark after the watermarked image has been attacked, making the scheme resistant to geometric attacks. In particular, the IULPM allows for greater accuracy when estimating the rotation angle of a geometric attack. At the same time, the watermark embedding employs the image holistically, rather than in a block pattern.

To explore a possible solution to the urgent problem, in this paper, we first introduced the quaternion into the representation of color image. In this way, a color can be represented and analyzed as a single entity. Then a novel artificial bee colony method named improved artificial bee colony which can improve the performance of conventional artificial bee colony was proposed. In this method, in order to balance the exploration and the exploitation, two new search equations were presented to generate candidate solutions in the employed bee phase and the onlookers phase, respectively. Additionally, some more reasonable artificial bee colony parameters were proposed to improve the performance of the artificial bee colony. Then we applied the proposed method to the quaternion vectors to perform the edge detection of color remote sensing image. Experimental results show that our method can get a better edge detection effect than other methods.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60092861","afid":"60092861","affilname":"Sichuan University of Arts and Science","affiliation-city":"Dazhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026846","afid":"60026846","affilname":"Chengdu University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Chengdu","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/112968333","afid":"112968333","affilname":"China Academy of Telecommunications Technology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54385506700","authid":"54385506700","authname":"Liu D.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Dujin","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026846"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60092861"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55689029400","authid":"55689029400","authname":"Wang H.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Huajun","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026846"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57207090151","authid":"57207090151","authname":"Wang S.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Sen","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"112968333"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24832447400","authid":"24832447400","authname":"Pu G.","surname":"Pu","given-name":"Guolin","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60092861"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56564558800","authid":"56564558800","authname":"Deng X.","surname":"Deng","given-name":"Xiaoya","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60092861"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56564610900","authid":"56564610900","authname":"Hou X.","surname":"Hou","given-name":"Xiang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60092861"}]}],"article-number":"138930","source-id":"13082","fund-no":"61005018","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84925002501"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84925002501?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84925002501&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84925002501&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84925002501","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84925002501","eid":"2-s2.0-84925002501","dc:title":"Multiple reflectors based autocollimator for three-dimensional angle measurement","dc:creator":"Su A.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","prism:issn":"0277786X","prism:eIssn":"1996756X","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781628413885"}],"prism:volume":"9302","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2015","prism:doi":"10.1117/12.2076892","dc:description":"This paper designs a multiple reflectors based autocollimator, and proposes a direct linear solution for three-dimensional (3D) angle measurement with the observation vectors of the reflected lights from the reflectors.

Any rotation of the object will induce a change in the observation vectors of the reflected lights, which is used to solve the rotation matrix of the object by finding a linear solution of Wahba problem with the quaternion method, and then the 3D angle is obtained by decomposing the rotation matrix. This measuring apparatus can be implemented easily as the light path is simple, and the computation of 3D angle with observation vectors is efficient as there is no need to iterate.

Moments and moment invariants have become a powerful tool in robust image watermarking owing to their image description capability and geometric invariance property. However, the existing moment-based watermarking schemes were mainly designed for gray images but not for color images, and detection quality and robustness will be lowered when watermark is directly embedded into the luminance component or three color channels of color images. Furthermore, the imperceptibility of the embedded watermark is not well guaranteed. Based on algebra of quaternions and polar harmonic transform (PHT), we introduced the quaternion polar harmonic transform (QPHT) for invariant color image watermarking in this article, which can be seen as the generalization of PHT for gray-level images. It is shown that the QPHT can be obtained from the PHT of each color channel. We derived and analyzed the rotation, scaling, and translation (RST) invariant property of QPHT. We also discussed the problem of color image watermarking using QPHT.

It is formulated by using logarithmic estimates which may be obtained from a sharp of Pitt's inequality; the other part is the uncertainty principle of Donoho and Stark associated with the quaternion Fourier transform.","citedby-count":"78","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005816","afid":"60005816","affilname":"South China Normal University","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56517135600","authid":"56517135600","authname":"Chen L.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Li Ping","initials":"L.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005816"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003837546","authid":"7003837546","authname":"Kou K.","surname":"Kou","given-name":"Kit Ian","initials":"K.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55743438800","authid":"55743438800","authname":"Liu M.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Ming Sheng","initials":"M.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005816"}]}],"authkeywords":"Logarithmic uncertainty estimate | Pitt's inequality | Quaternion Fourier transform | Uncertainty principle","source-id":"23935","fund-acr":"UM","fund-no":"FDCT/099/2012/A3","fund-sponsor":"Universidade de Macau","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84922828475"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84922828475?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84922828475&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84922828475&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S016516841400509X"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84922828475","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84922828475","eid":"2-s2.0-84922828475","dc:title":"Optimal and secure audio watermarking scheme based on self-adaptive particle swarm optimization and quaternion wavelet transform","dc:creator":"Lei B.","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing","prism:issn":"01651684","prism:volume":"113","prism:pageRange":"80-94","prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"August 2015","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.sigpro.2014.11.007","pii":"S016516841400509X","dc:description":"In this paper, a new audio watermarking scheme based on self-adaptive particle swarm optimization (SAPSO) and quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) is proposed. By obtaining optimal watermark strength using a uniquely designed objective function, SAPSO addresses the conflicting problem of robustness, imperceptibility, and capacity of audio watermarking scheme using self-adjusted parameters. To withstand de-synchronization attack, a synchronization sequence generated by chaotic signals is also adopted in our scheme. Furthermore, the utilization of chaotic signals significantly enhances the security of the proposed scheme. The experimental results validate that our scheme is not only robust against de-synchronization attack, but also typical signal manipulations and StirMark attack.

Relative to the background, the salient regions are more aggregative in color or texture distribution. In this paper, we introduce the conception of aggregation degree, and propose a novel bottom-up saliency detection framework using the aggregation degree of color and texture. Firstly, the color saliency areas are extracted from each channel in the Lab and HSV color space, and the significance of each saliency area is evaluated by the aggregation degree and their divergence. Then the texture saliency map is extracted with the local phase of hypercomplex, which is constructed by the detail signal of stationary wavelet transform (SWT) and its Hilbert transform. Finally, we design an effective mechanism for credit feature maps selection depending on aggregation degree, and the final saliency map is reconstructed by fusing credit feature maps. Extensive experiments with ASD database and the performance comparison with seven state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate that our algorithm achieves better performance.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024542","afid":"60024542","affilname":"South China University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55834627600","authid":"55834627600","authname":"Wo Y.","surname":"Wo","given-name":"Yan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024542"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192472461","authid":"57192472461","authname":"Chen X.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Xi","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024542"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202923324","authid":"7202923324","authname":"Han G.","surname":"Han","given-name":"Guoqiang","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024542"}]}],"authkeywords":"Aggregation degree | Credit feature selection | Hilbert transform | Hypercomplex | Saliency detection","source-id":"13803","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61003270","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84919742506"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84919742506?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84919742506&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84919742506&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0165168414005581"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84919742506","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84919742506","eid":"2-s2.0-84919742506","dc:title":"Quaternion Fourier transform based alpha-rooting method for color image measurement and enhancement","dc:creator":"Grigoryan A.M.","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing","prism:issn":"01651684","prism:volume":"109","prism:pageRange":"269-289","prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2015","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.sigpro.2014.11.019","pii":"S0165168414005581","dc:description":"The aim of this paper is to present a transform-based framework for color image enhancement which processes all three color components (R,G,B) simultaneously. In this framework, the image enhancement procedure is supported by a two-dimensional discrete quaternion Fourier transform and the new multi-frequency band α-rooting concept. Moreover, we introduce a simple measure to evaluate the quality of enhanced color images. Additionally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms against recently proposed methods which separately process color channels. Preliminary results show that the presented algorithm out-performs other enhancement methods such as the traditional Fourier transform-based alpha-rooting and the multi-scale Retinex algorithms. The proposed algorithms are fast and simple in implementation and design which makes them very practical for image enhancement.","citedby-count":"50","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003212","afid":"60003212","affilname":"The University of Texas at San Antonio","affiliation-city":"San Antonio","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006123399","authid":"7006123399","authname":"Grigoryan A.M.","surname":"Grigoryan","given-name":"Artyom M.","initials":"A.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003212"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56459862100","authid":"56459862100","orcid":"0000-0002-7889-6228","authname":"Jenkinson J.","surname":"Jenkinson","given-name":"John","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003212"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003395533","authid":"7003395533","authname":"Agaian S.S.","surname":"Agaian","given-name":"Sos S.","initials":"S.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003212"}]}],"authkeywords":"Alpha-rooting | Discrete quaternion Fourier transform | Histogram equalization | Image enhancement","source-id":"25548","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84910093810"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84910093810?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84910093810&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84910093810&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84910093810","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84910093810","eid":"2-s2.0-84910093810","dc:title":"An inertial pen with dynamic time warping recognizer for handwriting and gesture recognition","dc:creator":"Hsu Y.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Sensors Journal","prism:issn":"1530437X","prism:volume":"15","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"154-163","prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"January 2015","prism:doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2014.2339843","dc:description":"This paper presents an inertial-sensor-based digital pen (inertial pen) and its associated dynamic time warping (DTW)-based recognition algorithm for handwriting and gesture recognition. Users hold the inertial pen to write numerals or English lowercase letters and make hand gestures with their preferred handheld style and speed. The inertial signals generated by hand motions are wirelessly transmitted to a computer for online recognition. The proposed DTW-based recognition algorithm includes the procedures of inertial signal acquisition, signal preprocessing, motion detection, template selection, and recognition. We integrate signals collected from an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a magnetometer into a quaternion-based complementary filter for reducing the integral errors caused by the signal drift or intrinsic noise of the gyroscope, which might reduce the accuracy of the orientation estimation. Furthermore, we have developed a minimal intra-class to maximal inter-class based template selection method (min-max template selection method) for a DTW recognizer to obtain a superior class separation for improved recognition. Experimental results have successfully validated the effectiveness of the DTW-based recognition algorithm for online handwriting and gesture recognition using the inertial pen.","citedby-count":"96","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014982","afid":"60014982","affilname":"National Cheng Kung University","affiliation-city":"Tainan","affiliation-country":"Taiwan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36729819300","authid":"36729819300","authname":"Hsu Y.","surname":"Hsu","given-name":"Yu Liang","initials":"Y.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014982"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55786345800","authid":"55786345800","authname":"Chu C.","surname":"Chu","given-name":"Cheng Ling","initials":"C.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014982"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8572437600","authid":"8572437600","authname":"Tsai Y.","surname":"Tsai","given-name":"Yi Ju","initials":"Y.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014982"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7701313582","authid":"7701313582","authname":"Wang J.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Jeen Shing","initials":"J.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014982"}]}],"authkeywords":"Dynamic time warping | Gesture recognition | Handwriting recognition | Inertial pen | Quaternion-based complementary filter","article-number":"6945920","source-id":"15047","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84907562871"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84907562871?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84907562871&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84907562871&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S003039921400200X"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84907562871","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84907562871","eid":"2-s2.0-84907562871","dc:title":"Invariant quaternion radial harmonic Fourier moments for color image retrieval","dc:creator":"Xiang-Yang W.","prism:publicationName":"Optics and Laser Technology","prism:issn":"00303992","prism:volume":"66","prism:pageRange":"78-88","prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"March 2015","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.optlastec.2014.07.020","pii":"S003039921400200X","dc:description":"Moments and moment invariants have become a powerful tool in image processing owing to their image description capability and invariance property. But, conventional methods are mainly introduced to deal with the binary or gray-scale images, and the only approaches for color image always have poor color image description capability. Based on radial harmonic Fourier moments (RHFMs) and quaternion, we introduced the quaternion radial harmonic Fourier moments (QRHFMs) for representing color images in this paper, which can be seen as the generalization of RHFMs for gray-level images. It is shown that the QRHFMs can be obtained from the RHFMs of each color channel. We derived and analyzed the rotation, scaling, and translation (RST) invariant property of QRHFMs. We also discussed the problem of color image retrieval using invariant QRHFMs. Experimental results are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed color image representation.","citedby-count":"51","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017010","afid":"60017010","affilname":"Liaoning Normal University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010080","afid":"60010080","affilname":"Nanjing University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54685339900","authid":"54685339900","authname":"Xiang-Yang W.","surname":"Xiang-Yang","given-name":"Wang","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010080"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56374202200","authid":"56374202200","authname":"Wei-Yi L.","surname":"Wei-Yi","given-name":"Li","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972350300","authid":"34972350300","authname":"Hong-Ying Y.","surname":"Hong-Ying","given-name":"Yang","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56373262000","authid":"56373262000","authname":"Pan-Pan N.","surname":"Pan-Pan","given-name":"Niu","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36612650200","authid":"36612650200","authname":"Yong-Wei L.","surname":"Yong-Wei","given-name":"Li","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image | Fourier moments | Quaternion | Radial harmonic","source-id":"12346","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"L2013407","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
