Ultrasound imaging plays an important role in diagnosis, especially in medical fields, which has a large impact on clinical analysis. However, there is limited number of 3D ultrasound machines in the market and most of the medical practices are unable to use this kind of facilities to conduct their analysis. Thus, the shelf game controller that equipped with the position tracking device can be added into the existing 2D ultrasound machine to increase the capability of the 2D machine to visualize ultrasound images in 3D. Position tracking with the PlayStation Move does not only provide the lowcost alternative, but it is a portable device as well. From the collected data, Quaternion technique is selected to approximate the movement in 3D. Quaternion provides a convenient mathematical notation for representing orientations and rotations of objects in three dimensions. Quaternion method is numerically more stable and efficient because it can avoid the problem of gimbal lock. By using PlayStation Move, the medical operative can scan the subject by using the existing 2D ultrasound probe in 3D.The information such as the positions and orientations of the image at a certain location is integrated with 2D ultrasound imaging to generate a 3D ultrasound imaging.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021005","afid":"60021005","affilname":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia","affiliation-city":"Johor Bahru","affiliation-country":"Malaysia"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55416008900","authid":"55416008900","authname":"Mohamed F.","surname":"Mohamed","given-name":"Farhan","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021005"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021005"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57034073400","authid":"57034073400","authname":"Mong W.S.","surname":"Mong","given-name":"W.

We proposed a color inverse halftoning image quality assessment method based on image structural property. First, we transformed printing image into inverse halftoning image with wavelet transforming inverse halftoning algorithm. Then, taking quaternion matrix as the carrier and combining with details of image, brightness and color information, we can convert halftoning image into quaternion matrix and obtain feature vector through singular value decomposition. Finally, the inverse halftoning image quality assessment is accomplished by calculating the quaternion singular feature vector angle to indicate the similarity of the original image and the inverse halftoning image. The result of experiment shows that the assessment can excellently exhibit the reduction of the inverse halftone image quality. Meanwhile, it is also in line with subjective visual perception and provides a reference for constructing quantitative assessment index of the inverse halftone color image quality.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/101001149","afid":"101001149","affilname":"The Peopleâ€™s Printing Plant of Guangzhou Co., Ltd","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57022682000","authid":"57022682000","authname":"Shi Z.","surname":"Shi","given-name":"Zhixiong","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"101001149"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57024249000","authid":"57024249000","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiaodong","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"101001149"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55488792100","authid":"55488792100","authname":"Fu L.","surname":"Fu","given-name":"Lujing","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"101001149"}]}],"authkeywords":"Image quality assessment | Inverse halftoning | Quaternion | Wavelet transform","source-id":"19700186822","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84951207695"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84951207695?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84951207695&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84951207695&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84951207695","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84951207695","eid":"2-s2.0-84951207695","dc:title":"The image sharpness metric via gaussian mixture modeling of the quaternion wavelet transform phase coefficients with applications","dc:creator":"Liu Y.","prism:publicationName":"Studies in Computational Intelligence","prism:issn":"1860949X","prism:volume":"619","prism:pageRange":"167-178","prism:coverDate":"2016-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 January 2016","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-26396-0_13","dc:description":"In this paper, we make use of Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to describe the coefficients distribution of the quaternion wavelet transform (QWT).
