Most of the applications relate to monochrome and gray-scale images. Recently, the theory of image moments for gray-scale images has been extended to color images using quaternion moments to explore the benefit of color information while representing the color images by moments. In this paper, we propose multi-channel ORIMs (MORIMs) invariants for color images and compare their performance with the existing quaternion moments, called quaternion orthogonal rotation invariant moments (QORIMs). The theoretical and experimental analysis demonstrates the superiority of the proposed MORIMs over the QORIMs invariants in the color image recognition task. The experiments are conducted by considering Zernike moments (ZMs) and quaternion ZMs (QZMs) as the representatives of MORIMs and QORIMs, respectively.","citedby-count":"42","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000690","afid":"60000690","affilname":"Punjabi University","affiliation-city":"Patiala","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56594302700","authid":"56594302700","orcid":"0000-0002-8059-1263","authname":"Singh C.","surname":"Singh","given-name":"Chandan","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000690"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57213875715","authid":"57213875715","authname":"Singh J.","surname":"Singh","given-name":"Jaspreet","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000690"}]}],"authkeywords":"Multi-channel moments | Orthogonal moments | Quaternion moments | Rotation invariants | Scale invariants","source-id":"24306","fund-acr":"UGC","fund-no":"43-275/2014(SR)","fund-sponsor":"University Grants Commission","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85042367533"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85042367533?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85042367533&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85042367533&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0165168418300719"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85042367533","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85042367533","eid":"2-s2.0-85042367533","dc:title":"Simultaneous diagonalisation of the covariance and complementary covariance matrices in quaternion widely linear signal processing","dc:creator":"Xiang M.","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing","prism:issn":"01651684","prism:volume":"148","prism:pageRange":"193-204","prism:coverDate":"2018-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2018","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.sigpro.2018.02.018","pii":"S0165168418300719","dc:description":"Recent developments in quaternion-valued widely linear processing have established that the exploitation of complete second-order statistics requires consideration of both the standard covariance and the three complementary covariance matrices. Although such matrices have a tremendous amount of structure and their decomposition is a powerful tool in a variety of applications, the non-commutative nature of the quaternion product has been prohibitive to the development of quaternion uncorrelating transforms. To this end, we introduce novel techniques for a simultaneous decomposition of the covariance and complementary covariance matrices in the quaternion domain, whereby the quaternion version of the Takagi factorisation is explored to diagonalise symmetric quaternion-valued matrices. This gives new insights into the quaternion uncorrelating transform (QUT) and forms a basis for the proposed quaternion approximate uncorrelating transform (QAUT) which simultaneously diagonalises all four covariance matrices associated with improper quaternion signals. The effectiveness of the proposed uncorrelating transforms is validated by simulations on both synthetic and real-world quaternion-valued signals.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021097","afid":"60021097","affilname":"University of Surrey","affiliation-city":"Guildford","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015150","afid":"60015150","affilname":"Imperial College London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005244","afid":"60005244","affilname":"Southeast University","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189332044","authid":"57189332044","orcid":"0000-0002-0239-3392","authname":"Xiang M.","surname":"Xiang","given-name":"Min","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56266552400","authid":"56266552400","authname":"Enshaeifar S.","surname":"Enshaeifar","given-name":"Shirin","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021097"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194874200","authid":"57194874200","authname":"Stott A.E.","surname":"Stott","given-name":"Alexander E.","initials":"A.E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56614550100","authid":"56614550100","authname":"Took C.C.","surname":"Took","given-name":"Clive Cheong","initials":"C.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021097"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25958477900","authid":"25958477900","orcid":"0000-0002-4402-8131","authname":"Xia Y.","surname":"Xia","given-name":"Yili","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56135784800","authid":"56135784800","authname":"Kanna S.","surname":"Kanna","given-name":"Sithan","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006513328","authid":"7006513328","authname":"Mandic D.P.","surname":"Mandic","given-name":"Danilo P.","initials":"D.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]}],"authkeywords":"Complementary covariance | Improperness | Pseudo-covariance | Quaternion matrix diagonalisation | Quaternion non-circularity | Widely linear processing","source-id":"25548","fund-acr":"EPSRC","fund-no":"EP/H026266/1","fund-sponsor":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050246791"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050246791?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85050246791&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85050246791&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050246791","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85050246791","eid":"2-s2.0-85050246791","dc:title":"Moving object attention selection using optical flow and pulse coupled neural network","dc:creator":"Wang J.","prism:publicationName":"ICNC-FSKD 2017 - 13th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538621653"}],"prism:pageRange":"2705-2709","prism:coverDate":"2018-06-21","prism:coverDisplayDate":"21 June 2018","prism:doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2017.8393205","dc:description":"At present, moving object detection acts a significant part in plenty of video surveillance systems. However, it is still challenging to obtain both the reliable accuracy as well as the fast processing speed. Therefore, a novel moving object detection model is addressed in this paper, employing Unit-linking PCNN, optical flow and topological property. Optical flow, which includes abundant motion information, has already been extensively studied for moving objects detection in the last decade. In this approach, Unit linking PCNN whole filter is used to represent the connectivity and integrity, which are significant topology properties, in moving object attention selection. Because of the smoothness ability of Unit-linking PCNN, the proposed approach can improve the quality of optical flow. False results can be eliminated to some extent and the detection accuracy improves. For video frames, we combine phase spectrums of topological property with color pairs by using quaternion Fourier transform to obtain saliency map. The experimental results on three databases reveal that the proposed approach reaches a higher detection accuracy and faster speed than FT(Frequency tuned salient region detection), GBVS(Graph-Based Visual Saliency) and PQFT(phase spectrum of quaternion Fourier transform).","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009860","afid":"60009860","affilname":"Fudan University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203011966","authid":"57203011966","authname":"Wang J.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Jiancheng","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009860"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403204205","authid":"7403204205","authname":"Gu X.","surname":"Gu","given-name":"Xiaodong","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009860"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attention selection | Optical flow | PCNN-hole filter | Saliency map | Topological property","source-id":"21100868892","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61371148","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050200314"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050200314?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85050200314&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85050200314&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050200314","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85050200314","eid":"2-s2.0-85050200314","dc:title":"Visual saliency using unit-linking PCNN image segmentation","dc:creator":"Hua Y.","prism:publicationName":"ICNC-FSKD 2017 - 13th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538621653"}],"prism:pageRange":"879-883","prism:coverDate":"2018-06-21","prism:coverDisplayDate":"21 June 2018","prism:doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2017.8393392","dc:description":"This paper introduces an approach to using Unit-linking Pulse Coupled Neural Network (Unit-linking PCNN) based image segmentation to enhance visual saliency.

Therefore, it is essential to solve this problem using anti-spoofing measures that can determine whether the face image presented to the system is genuine or a spoof. In this paper, we proposed a novel anti-spoofing system based on local texture features. The local features of the input image are extracted using Quaternionic Local Ranking Binary Pattern (QLRBP). We evaluate the effectiveness of these features using two different classifiers, namely the K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Our experiments using publicly available datasets show that our proposed system could achieve up to 95.20% accuracy (at 205.62 ms per frame) using the KNN classifier. Using the SVM, our proposed system can achieve up to 97.36% accuracy at 229.39 ms per frame. These results show that the QLRBP features are suitable to be used in a face anti-spoofing applications.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60069419","afid":"60069419","affilname":"Satya Wacana Christian University","affiliation-city":"Salatiga","affiliation-country":"Indonesia"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202781604","authid":"57202781604","authname":"Cornelia A.","surname":"Cornelia","given-name":"Ane","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069419"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193931420","authid":"57193931420","authname":"Setyawan I.","surname":"Setyawan","given-name":"Iwan","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069419"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/51061207400","authid":"51061207400","authname":"Dewantoro G.","surname":"Dewantoro","given-name":"Gunawan","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069419"}]}],"authkeywords":"face anti-spoofing | qlrbp","source-id":"21100866659","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049122265"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049122265?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85049122265&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85049122265&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049122265","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85049122265","eid":"2-s2.0-85049122265","dc:title":"Quaternion wavelet transform based full reference image quality assessment for multiply distorted images","dc:creator":"Li C.","prism:publicationName":"PLoS ONE","prism:eIssn":"19326203","prism:volume":"13","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2018-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2018","prism:doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0199430","dc:description":"Most of real-world image distortions are multiply distortion rather than single distortion.

Firstly, the reference images and distorted images are decomposed by QWT, and then the similarity of amplitude and phase are calculated on each subband, thirdly the IQA metric is constructed by the weighting method considering human visual system (HVS) characteristics, and lastly the scores of each subband are averaged to get the quality score of test image.

Moreover, the proposed QLMK algorithm has naturally a robust behaviour for a wide range of noise signals due to its kurtosis-based cost function. Furthermore, the steady-state performance of the proposed QLMK algorithm is analysed to obtain convergence and misadjustment conditions. The comprehensive simulation results on benchmark and real-world problems show that the use of this cost function defined by the quaternion statistics in the proposed QLMK algorithm allows us to process quaternion-valued signals and thus, significantly enhances the performance of the adaptive filter in terms of both the steady-state error and the convergence rate, as compared with the quaternion-valued least-mean-square algorithm based on the recent GHR calculus.","citedby-count":"17","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004366","afid":"60004366","affilname":"Nigde Omer Halisdemir University","affiliation-city":"Niğde","affiliation-country":"Turkey"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/43261698200","authid":"43261698200","authname":"Mengüç E.C.","surname":"Mengüç","given-name":"Engin Cemal","initials":"E.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004366"}]}],"source-id":"6100153106","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047534564"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047534564?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85047534564&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85047534564&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047534564","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85047534564","eid":"2-s2.0-85047534564","dc:title":"Saliency Detection for Stereoscopic 3D Images in the Quaternion Frequency Domain","dc:creator":"Cai X.","prism:publicationName":"3D Research","prism:eIssn":"20926731","prism:volume":"9","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2018-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 June 2018","prism:doi":"10.1007/s13319-018-0169-8","dc:description":"Recent studies have shown that a remarkable distinction exists between human binocular and monocular viewing behaviors. Compared with two-dimensional (2D) saliency detection models, stereoscopic three-dimensional (S3D) image saliency detection is a more challenging task. In this paper, we propose a saliency detection model for S3D images. The final saliency map of this model is constructed from the local quaternion Fourier transform (QFT) sparse feature and global QFT log-Gabor feature. More specifically, the local QFT feature measures the saliency map of an S3D image by analyzing the location of a similar patch. The similar patch is chosen using a sparse representation method. The global saliency map is generated by applying the wake edge-enhanced gradient QFT map through a band-pass filter. The results of experiments on two public datasets show that the proposed model outperforms existing computational saliency models for estimating S3D image saliency.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017431","afid":"60017431","affilname":"Zhejiang University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Hangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003970","afid":"60003970","affilname":"Zhejiang University","affiliation-city":"Hangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202232595","authid":"57202232595","authname":"Cai X.","surname":"Cai","given-name":"Xingyu","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017431"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24781509400","authid":"24781509400","authname":"Zhou W.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Wujie","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017431"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003970"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57197618467","authid":"57197618467","authname":"Cen G.","surname":"Cen","given-name":"Gang","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017431"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36876668700","authid":"36876668700","authname":"Qiu W.","surname":"Qiu","given-name":"Weiwei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017431"}]}],"authkeywords":"Log-Gabor filter | Quaternion Fourier Transform (QFT) | Sparse feature | Stereoscopic three-dimensional (S3D) saliency","article-number":"22","source-id":"21100229836","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61502429","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85044451202"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85044451202?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85044451202&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85044451202&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S002002551631667X"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85044451202","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85044451202","eid":"2-s2.0-85044451202","dc:title":"Quaternion polar harmonic Fourier moments for color images","dc:creator":"Wang C.","prism:publicationName":"Information Sciences","prism:issn":"00200255","prism:volume":"450","prism:pageRange":"141-156","prism:coverDate":"2018-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2018","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.ins.2018.03.040","pii":"S002002551631667X","dc:description":"This paper proposes quaternion polar harmonic Fourier moments (QPHFM) for color image processing and analyzes the properties of QPHFM.

A hard thresholding strategy is used to determine whether a color pixel is corrupted by impulse noise or not (i.e., an outlier). The noisy pixels detected will be restored by a weighted vector median filter, while the noise-free pixels remain unchanged.

These new moments are circular moments defined over a unit disk by using a new set of orthogonal basis functions called radial-substituted Chebyshev functions. A new hybrid method is proposed for highly accurate computation of QRSCMs in polar coordinates. In this method, the angular kernel is exactly computed by analytical integration of Fourier function over circular pixels. The radial kernel is computed using a recurrence relation which completely eliminates the coefficient matrix associated with the radial-substituted Chebyshev functions.

In contrast to the existing saliency detection models, the advantage of the proposed approach is that it can combine quaternion number system and object cues simultaneously, which is independent of image contents and scenes. Firstly, QDWLD, which was initially designed for detecting outliers in color images, is used to represent the directional cues in an image. Meanwhile, two low-level priors, namely the Convex-Hull-Based center and color contrast cue of the image, are utilized and fused as an object-level cue. Finally, by combining QDWLD with object cues, a reliable saliency map of the image can be computed and estimated. Experimental results, based on two widely used and openly available database, show that the proposed method is able to produce reliable and promising salient maps/estimations, compared to other state-of-the-art saliency-detection models.","citedby-count":"28","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60122420","afid":"60122420","affilname":"Shandong University of Finance and Economics","affiliation-city":"Jinan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073726","afid":"60073726","affilname":"Ludong University","affiliation-city":"Yantai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022422","afid":"60022422","affilname":"Ocean University of China","affiliation-city":"Qingdao","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008928","afid":"60008928","affilname":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/22634073600","authid":"22634073600","authname":"Jian M.","surname":"Jian","given-name":"Muwei","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122420"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022422"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57200743882","authid":"57200743882","authname":"Qi Q.","surname":"Qi","given-name":"Qiang","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022422"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/22634069200","authid":"22634069200","authname":"Dong J.","surname":"Dong","given-name":"Junyu","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022422"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56366080900","authid":"56366080900","authname":"Sun X.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Xin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022422"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23974770700","authid":"23974770700","authname":"Sun Y.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Yujuan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073726"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55839377100","authid":"55839377100","authname":"Lam K.","surname":"Lam","given-name":"Kin Man","initials":"K.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008928"}]}],"authkeywords":"Directional cues | Object cues | Saliency detection | Weber descriptor","source-id":"25627","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"201603045","fund-sponsor":"Jiangsu Province Postdoctoral Science Foundation","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85043784330"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85043784330?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85043784330&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85043784330&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0925231218302443"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85043784330","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85043784330","eid":"2-s2.0-85043784330","dc:title":"Existence and global exponential stability of periodic solutions for quaternion-valued cellular neural networks with time-varying delays","dc:creator":"Li Y.","prism:publicationName":"Neurocomputing","prism:issn":"09252312","prism:eIssn":"18728286","prism:volume":"292","prism:pageRange":"91-103","prism:coverDate":"2018-05-31","prism:coverDisplayDate":"31 May 2018","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.neucom.2018.02.077","pii":"S0925231218302443","dc:description":"In this paper, a class of quaternion-valued cellular neural networks (QVCNNs) with time-varying delays is considered.

The color transfer is a technique by enforcing an image having similar color characteristics with another. Considering the pixels of reference image and target image as point clouds in RGB color space, then the color transfer becomes geometrical transformation to make the target image have the same distribution with that of the reference image. The geometrical transformation matrices are computed by decomposing the covariance matrix of the two images. For visualizing the process of color transfer, the transform matrices are interpolated. Since rotation matrix cannot be interpolated directly, a quaternion interpolation is proposed for completing this task. Moreover, a curved interpolation path is designed to avoid saturation shortness during visualization. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs well.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030004","afid":"60030004","affilname":"Xihua University","affiliation-city":"Chengdu","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019716","afid":"60019716","affilname":"Hiroshima Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Hiroshima","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57023456500","authid":"57023456500","authname":"Zhang X.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xiaohua","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019716"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24338642200","authid":"24338642200","authname":"Jiang W.","surname":"Jiang","given-name":"Wenbo","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030004"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55717482000","authid":"55717482000","authname":"Liu X.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Xia","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030004"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201124049","authid":"57201124049","authname":"Lei X.","surname":"Lei","given-name":"Xia","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030004"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color transfer | Covariance matrix | Nonlinear interpolation path | Quaternion | Visualization","source-id":"21100865106","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050529171"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050529171?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85050529171&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85050529171&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050529171","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85050529171","eid":"2-s2.0-85050529171","dc:title":"Partial study of quadrotor based on quaternions","dc:creator":"Ji X.","prism:publicationName":"AIP Conference Proceedings","prism:issn":"0094243X","prism:eIssn":"15517616","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780735416727"}],"prism:volume":"1967","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2018-05-23","prism:coverDisplayDate":"23 May 2018","prism:doi":"10.1063/1.5039006","dc:description":"In this paper, the attitude calculation of quadrotor is studied, and the attitude angle of quaternions and the method of using IIR low pass filter to filter the high frequency noise are proposed. First of all, this paper puts forward the characteristics of quadrotor more flexible than other aircraft. The flexible steering mode of quadrotor is classified into three categories. Starting from reality, this paper proposes an algorithm to transform the value of acceleration sensor to pose angle, which can greatly reduce the amount of computation and is the theoretical basis for real-time attitude calculation of aircraft. When introducing the number of quaternion, this article starts from the theoretical model and first introduces the conceptual meaning of the number of quaternion. In this model, the aircraft's own coordinate axis and the geographical axis are regarded as two rigid bodies, and they have three coordinate axes that are orthogonal to each other. When the steering operation is involved, the corresponding acceleration is generated. By using the quaternion multiplicative formula mentioned in this paper, the change of attitude angle can be obtained. n reality, in order to ensure the accuracy of the output attitude angle. More accurate input variables are often needed, and the IIR low pass filter is introduced in this way. In this paper, a nine order IIR filter is designed according to the actual situation, and its spectrum characteristics are obtained by simulation software. After mixing the original signal generated by propeller's high frequency noise, it outputs clean signals through filter, all of which are intuitively reflected by three spectrum images. After giving some practical solutions, this paper looks forward to the prospect of the aircraft.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60108757","afid":"60108757","affilname":"North China Electric Power University (Baoding)","affiliation-city":"Baoding","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201801723","authid":"57201801723","authname":"Ji X.","surname":"Ji","given-name":"Xiang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60108757"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude calculation | IIR low pass filter | quadrotor quaternions","article-number":"020034","source-id":"26916","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048502847"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048502847?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85048502847&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85048502847&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048502847","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85048502847","eid":"2-s2.0-85048502847","dc:title":"Partical filtering for orientation determining using inertial sensors IMU","dc:creator":"Habbachi S.","prism:publicationName":"2018 4th International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Signal and Image Processing, ATSIP 2018","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538652398"}],"prism:pageRange":"1-5","prism:coverDate":"2018-05-23","prism:coverDisplayDate":"23 May 2018","prism:doi":"10.1109/ATSIP.2018.8364487","dc:description":"Using a low cost Inertial Measurement Sensor (IMU) to estimate an accurate orientation of human body is a challenging work.

Since the group algebras R[ Gp,q] are Z2-graded and the ideal J is homogeneous, the quotient algebras R[ G] / J are Z2-graded. In some instances, the isomorphism R[ G] / J≅ Cℓp,q is also Z2-graded. By Salingaros’ Theorem, the groups Gp,q in the class N2k-1 are iterative central products of k copies of the dihedral group D8 while the groups in the class N2k are iterative central products of k- 1 copies of the dihedral group D8 and one copy of the quaternion group Q8, and so they are extra-special. The groups Gp,q in the classes Ω 2k-1 and Ω 2k are central products of N2k-1 and N2k with C2× C2, respectively, while the groups in the class Sk are central products of N2k-1 or N2k with C4. Two algorithms to factor any Gp,q into an internal central product, depending on the class, are given. A complete table of central factorizations for groups of order up to 1, 024 is presented.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029255","afid":"60029255","affilname":"Tennessee Technological University","affiliation-city":"Cookeville","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7801600682","authid":"7801600682","orcid":"0000-0002-7064-8297","authname":"Abłamowicz R.","surname":"Abłamowicz","given-name":"Rafał","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029255"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201443093","authid":"57201443093","authname":"Varahagiri M.","surname":"Varahagiri","given-name":"Manisha","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029255"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201443062","authid":"57201443062","authname":"Walley A.M.","surname":"Walley","given-name":"Anne Marie","initials":"A.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029255"}]}],"authkeywords":"2-group | Central product | Clifford algebra | Cyclic group | Elementary abelian group | Extra-special group | Graded algebra morphism | Group algebra | Homogeneous ideal | Quotient algebra | Salingaros vee group | Z -graded algebra 2","article-number":"38","source-id":"4900152804","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85044284853"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85044284853?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85044284853&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85044284853&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85044284853","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85044284853","eid":"2-s2.0-85044284853","dc:title":"Directional Statistics Approach Based on Instantaneous Rotational Parameters of Tri-axial Trajectories for Footstep Detection","dc:creator":"Venkatraman D.","prism:publicationName":"Circuits, Systems, and Signal Processing","prism:issn":"0278081X","prism:eIssn":"15315878","prism:volume":"37","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"1958-1987","prism:coverDate":"2018-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 May 2018","prism:doi":"10.1007/s00034-017-0647-x","dc:description":"Polarization of tri-axial signals is defined using instantaneous rotational characteristics of the three-dimensional (3D) trajectory. We propose a rotational model to parameterize the time evolution of the 3D trajectory as a sequence of scaled rotations. Using this model, the velocity-to-rotation transform is defined to estimate the eigenangle, eigenaxis and orientation quaternion that quantify the instantaneous rotational parameters of the trajectory. These rotational parameters correspond to p-dimensional directional random vectors (DRVs). We propose two approaches to discriminate between the presence and absence of an elliptically polarized trajectory generated by human footsteps. In the first approach, we fit a von Mises–Fisher probability density function to the DRVs and estimate the concentration parameter. In the second approach, we employ the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the estimated nonparametric hyperspherical probability densities. The detection performance of the proposed metrics is shown to achieve an accuracy of 97 % compared to existing approaches of 82 % for footstep signals.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005510","afid":"60005510","affilname":"Nanyang Technological University","affiliation-city":"Singapore City","affiliation-country":"Singapore"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26433981800","authid":"26433981800","authname":"Venkatraman D.","surname":"Venkatraman","given-name":"Divya","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005510"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8390815000","authid":"8390815000","orcid":"0000-0002-0708-4791","authname":"Khong A.W.H.","surname":"Khong","given-name":"Andy W.H.","initials":"A.W.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005510"}]}],"authkeywords":"3D rotations | Directional statistics | Elliptical polarization | Orientation quaternion","source-id":"18780","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85044040969"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85044040969?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85044040969&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85044040969&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85044040969","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85044040969","eid":"2-s2.0-85044040969","dc:title":"Deep learning–based traffic sign recognition for unmanned autonomous vehicles","dc:creator":"Zang D.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

Colors are very important clues to identify traffic signs; however, color-based methods suffer performance degradation in the case of light variation. Convolutional neural network, as one of the deep learning methods, is able to hierarchically learn high-level features from the raw input. It has been proved that convolutional neural network–based approaches outperform the color-based ones. At present, inputs of convolutional neural networks are processed either as gray images or as three independent color channels; the learned color features are still not enough to represent traffic signs. Apart from colors, temporal constraint is also crucial to recognize video-based traffic signs. The characteristics of traffic signs in the time domain require further exploration. Quaternion numbers are able to encode multi-dimensional information, and they have been employed to describe color images. In this article, we are inspired to present a quaternion convolutional neural network–based approach to recognize traffic signs by fusing spatial and temporal features in a single framework. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can yield correct recognition results and obtain better performance when compared with the state-of-the-art work.","citedby-count":"16","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073652","afid":"60073652","affilname":"Tongji University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114380240","afid":"114380240","affilname":"Shanghai Lujie Electronic Technology Co., Ltd.","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34978044100","authid":"34978044100","authname":"Zang D.","surname":"Zang","given-name":"Di","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073652"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36653333200","authid":"36653333200","authname":"Wei Z.","surname":"Wei","given-name":"Zhihua","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073652"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190804666","authid":"57190804666","authname":"Bao M.","surname":"Bao","given-name":"Maomao","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073652"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55492579200","authid":"55492579200","authname":"Cheng J.","surname":"Cheng","given-name":"Jiujun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073652"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36633595100","authid":"36633595100","authname":"Zhang D.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Dongdong","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073652"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35389851000","authid":"35389851000","authname":"Tang K.","surname":"Tang","given-name":"Keshuang","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073652"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57196344821","authid":"57196344821","authname":"Li X.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Xin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"114380240"}]}],"authkeywords":"quaternion convolutional neural network | Traffic sign recognition | unmanned autonomous vehicle","source-id":"20409","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61472284","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85043379835"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85043379835?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85043379835&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85043379835&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1047320318300567"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85043379835","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85043379835","eid":"2-s2.0-85043379835","dc:title":"Integrating QDWD with pattern distinctness and local contrast for underwater saliency detection","dc:creator":"Jian M.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation","prism:issn":"10473203","prism:eIssn":"10959076","prism:volume":"53","prism:pageRange":"31-41","prism:coverDate":"2018-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May 2018","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jvcir.2018.03.008","pii":"S1047320318300567","dc:description":"In this paper, we propose a novel framework for underwater image saliency detection by exploiting Quaternionic Distance Based Weber Descriptor (QDWD), pattern distinctness, and local contrast.
