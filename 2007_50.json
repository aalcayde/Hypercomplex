The full estimation procedure is based on a separable wavelet decomposition of the observed image, and the estimation is improved by introducing the new threshold to estimate the decomposition coefficients. The observed wavelet coefficients are thresholded, using the magnitudes of wavelet transforms of a small number of \"replicates\"of the image. The \"replicates\"are calculated by extending the image into a vector-valued hyperanalytic signal. More than one hyperanalytic signal may be chosen, and either the hypercomplex or Riesz transforms are used, to calculate this object. The deterministic and stochastic properties of the observed wavelet coefficients of the hyperanalytic signal, at a fixed scale and position index, are determined. A \"universal\"threshold is calculated for the proposed procedure. An expression for the risk of an individual coefficient is derived. The risk is calculated explicitly when the \"universal\"threshold is used and is shown to be less than the risk of \"universal\"hard thresholding, under certain conditions. The proposed method is implemented and the derived theoretical risk reductions substantiated. © 2007 IEEE.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015150","afid":"60015150","affilname":"Imperial College London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"pubmed-id":"17547131","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6507545514","authid":"6507545514","authname":"Olhede S.","surname":"Olhede","given-name":"Sofia C.","initials":"S.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]}],"authkeywords":"2-D analytic | Hilbert transform | Image denoising | Wavelets","source-id":"25534","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34249303130"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34249303130?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=34249303130&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=34249303130&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34249303130","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:34249303130","eid":"2-s2.0-34249303130","dc:title":"Quaternion based information parallel fusion and its application in color face detection","dc:creator":"Fangnian L.","prism:publicationName":"International Conference on Signal Processing Proceedings, ICSP","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"0780397371"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780780397378"}],"prism:volume":"3","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2007-05-31","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2007","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2006.345922","dc:description":"Pointing to dimension limit of serial feature fusion method, and quantity limit of parallel complex vector feature fusion method, an evolution of parallel vector feature fusion method based on quaternion has been proposed.

Here, we developed such a model and tested its predictions experimentally in humans. Our visuomotor transformation model used visual information about current hand and desired target positions to compute the visual (gaze-centered) desired movement vector. It then transformed these eye-centered plans into shoulder-centered motor plans using extraretinal eye and head position signals accounting for the complete 3-D eye-in-head and head-on-shoulder geometry (i.e., translation and rotation). We compared actual memory-guided reaching performance to the predictions of the model. By removing extraretinal signals (i.e., eye-head rotations and the offset between the centers of rotation of the eye and head) from the model, we developed a compensation index describing how accurately the brain performs the 3-D visuomotor transformation for different head-restrained and head-unrestrained gaze positions as well as for eye and head roll. Overall, subjects did not show errors predicted when extraretinal signals were ignored. Their reaching performance was accurate and the compensation index revealed that subjects accounted for the 3-D visuomotor transformation geometry. This was also the case for the initial portion of the movement (before proprioceptive feedback) indicating that the desired reach plan is computed in a feed-forward fashion. These findings show that the visuomotor transformation for reaching implements an internal model of the complete eye-to-shoulder linkage geometry and does not only rely on feedback control mechanisms. We discuss the relevance of this model in predicting reaching behavior in several patient groups. © 2007 ARVO.","citedby-count":"65","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60118086","afid":"60118086","affilname":"York University, Centre for Vision Research","affiliation-city":"Toronto","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033420","afid":"60033420","affilname":"York University","affiliation-city":"Toronto","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000874","afid":"60000874","affilname":"Université Catholique de Louvain","affiliation-city":"Louvain-la-Neuve","affiliation-country":"Belgium"}],"pubmed-id":"18217844","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603426101","authid":"6603426101","authname":"Blohm G.","surname":"Blohm","given-name":"Gunnar","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60118086"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000874"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401850867","authid":"7401850867","authname":"Crawford J.D.","surname":"Crawford","given-name":"J.

The joint problem of inaccurate state estimation combined with low thrust is addressed through the use of Kalman filter and an LP-solvable constrained predictive controller. Attitude control is ensured by a globally stable quaternion-based adaptive feedback controller. Calibration of control signals for translational force actuation is introduced.

The eigenfunctions of the operator are determined and a nonseparable orthogonal set of radial wavelet functions are found. The eigenfunctions are optimally concentrated over a given region of radial space and scale space, defined via a triplet of parameters. Analytic forms for the energy concentration of the functions over the region are given. The radial function localization operator can be generalised to an operator localizing any L2(ℝ2) function. It is demonstrated that the latter operator, given an appropriate choice of localization region, approximately has the same radial eigenfunctions as the radial operator. Based on a given radial wavelet function a quaternionic wavelet is defined that can extract the local orientation of discontinuous signals as well as amplitude, orientation and phase structure of locally oscillatory signals. The full set of quaternionic wavelet functions are component by component orthogonal; their statistical properties are tractable, and forms for the variability of the estimators of the local phase and orientation are given, as well as the local energy of the image. By averaging estimators across wavelets, a substantial reduction in the variance is achieved. © 2007 IEEE.","citedby-count":"16","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015150","afid":"60015150","affilname":"Imperial College London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56631917000","authid":"56631917000","authname":"Metikas G.","surname":"Metikas","given-name":"Goergios","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6507545514","authid":"6507545514","authname":"Olhede S.","surname":"Olhede","given-name":"Sofia C.","initials":"S.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]}],"authkeywords":"Analytic signal | Image analysis | Monogenic signal | Riesz transform | Scalogram | Wavelets","source-id":"17391","fund-acr":"EPSRC","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33847695369"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33847695369?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33847695369&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33847695369&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33847695369","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:33847695369","eid":"2-s2.0-33847695369","dc:title":"Hypercomplex Fourier transforms of color images","dc:creator":"Ell T.A.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","prism:issn":"10577149","prism:volume":"16","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"22-35","prism:coverDate":"2007-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"February 2007","prism:doi":"10.1109/TIP.2006.884955","dc:description":"Fourier transforms are a fundamental tool in signal and image processing, yet, until recently, there was no definition of a Fourier transform applicable to color images in a holistic manner.

The properties of the transform are developed, and it is shown that the transform may be computed using two standard complex fast Fourier transforms. The resulting spectrum is explained in terms of familiar phase and modulus concepts, and a new concept of hypercomplex axis.

The corresponding quaternionic lattice structures maintain losslessness regardless of coefficient quantization and can be viewed as extensions of the classic two-band lattice developed by Vaidyanathan and Hoang.Moreover, the proposed approach enables a straightforward expression of the one-regularity conditions.

This method involves different Mueller Coherency matrix based parameters, like the eigenvalues analysis, the entropy factor calculation, polarization components crosstalks, linear and circular polarization degrees, hermiticity or the Quaternions analysis in case depolarisation properties of tissue are sufficiently low. All these parameters make information appear clearer and so increase image contrast, so pathologies like cancer could be detected in a sooner stage of development. The election will depend on the concrete pathological process under study. This Mueller Coherency matrix method can be applied to a single tissue point, or it can be combined with a tomographic technique, so as to obtain a 3D representation of polarization contrast parameters in pathological tissues.

The experimental results show that the proposed method gives a very significant improvement when compared to using only the illuminance information. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009577","afid":"60009577","affilname":"Instituto Tecnologico de Informatica","affiliation-city":"Valencia","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23399059200","authid":"23399059200","authname":"Villegas M.","surname":"Villegas","given-name":"Mauricio","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009577"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7007168408","authid":"7007168408","authname":"Paredes R.","surname":"Paredes","given-name":"Roberto","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009577"}]}],"source-id":"25674","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/38149015346"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/38149015346?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=38149015346&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=38149015346&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/38149015346","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:38149015346","eid":"2-s2.0-38149015346","dc:title":"Simulating cancer radiotherapy on a multi-level basis: Biology, oncology and image processing","dc:creator":"Dionysiou D.D.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783540733188"}],"prism:volume":"4561 LNCS","prism:pageRange":"569-575","prism:coverDate":"2007-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2007","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-540-73321-8_65","dc:description":"Tumour growth and response to radiotherapeutic schemes is a markedly multiscale process which by no means can be reduced to only molecular or cellular events.

Recently, small inertial sensors combining accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers were developed and appear to be promising for measuring human movement. However, the validity of such sensors for assessing three-dimensional (3D) trunk posture in motion has not been documented. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a hybrid system (HS) composed of two inertial sensors for the 3D measurement of trunk posture. A secondary purpose was to explore the utility of adding another source of information, a potentiometer, to measure the relative rotation between both sensors in order to improve the validity of the system. The first sensor was placed over the sacrum and the second on the upper part of the thorax. Both sensors were linked by a flexible rod with a potentiometer. A complementary quaternion filter algorithm was used to estimate trunk orientation by taking advantage of the nine components of each sensor and the potentiometer. The HS's orientations were compared to those obtained from a 3D optoelectronic system. Validation of the HS was performed in three steps in which six subjects had to perform manual handling tasks in: (1) static postures; (2) dynamic motions of short duration (30 s); and (3) dynamic motions of long duration (30 min). The results showed that the root mean square (RMS) error of the HS was generally below 3° for the flexion and lateral bending axes, and less than 6° for the torsion axis, and that this error was lower for the short-duration tests compared to the long-duration one. The potentiometer proved to be an essential addition, particularly when the magnetometer signals were corrupted and only the gyroscope and accelerometer could be combined. It is concluded that the HS can be a useful tool for quantifying 3D trunk posture in motion. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

To overcome these limitations, a novel method for generating 3D fractal sets based on a 3D number system named ternary algebra is proposed. Both theoretical analyses and experimental results demonstrate that the ternary-algebra-based method is superior to any one of the quad-algebra-based methods, including the first two methods presented in this paper, because it is more intuitive, less time consuming and can completely control the geometric structure of the resulting sets. A ray-casting algorithm based on period checking is developed with the goal of obtaining high-quality fractal images and is used to render all the fractal sets generated in our experiments.
