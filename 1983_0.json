Therefore it represents a particular morphism of the real algebra of quaternions-having for image a three-dimensional real linear subspace-and also a natural generalization of the Levi-Civita transformation. The quaternion matrix of the product leads to the KS-matrix; the bilinear relation and the two identities which play a central role in the KS-theory are easily derived. A suitable quaternion gauge-transformation is given which leads to the well-known fibration of the four-dimensional space. In addition several geometrical interpretations are brought out. Â© 1983 D.
