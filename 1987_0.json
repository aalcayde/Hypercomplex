This paper develops three-dimensional models for the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) and the internal feedback loop of the saccadid system. The models differ qualitatively from previous, one-dimensional versions, because the commutative algebra used in previous models does not apply to the three-dimensional rotations of the eye. 2. The hypothesis that eye position signals are generated by an eye velocity integrator in the indirect path of the VOR must be rejected because in three dimensions the integral of angular velocity does not specify angular postion. Computer simulations using eye velocity integrators show large, cummalative gaze errors and post-VOR drift. We describe a simple velocity to position transformation that works in three dimensions. 3. In the feedback control of saccades, eye position error is not the vector difference between actual and desired eye positions. Subtractive feedback models must continuously adjust the axis of rotation throughout a saccade, and they generate meandering, dysmetric gaze saccades. We describe a multiplicative feedback system that solves these problems and generates fixed-axis saccades that accord with Listing's law. 4. We show that Listing's las requires that most saccades have their axes out of Listing's plane. A corollary is that if three pools of short-lead burst neurons code the eye velocity command during saccades, the three pools are not yoked, but function independently during visually triggered saccades. 5. In our three-dimensional models, we represent eye position using four-component rotational operators called quaternions. This is not the only algebraic system for describing rotations, but it is the one that best fits the needs of the oculomotor system, and it yields much simpler models than do rotation matrix or other representations. 6. Quaternion models predict that eye position is represented on four channels in the oculomotory system: three for the vector components of eye position and one inversely related to gaze eccentricity and torsion. 7. Many testable predictions made by quaternion models also turn up in models based on other mathematics. These predictions are therefore more fundamental than the specific models that generate them. Among these predictions are 1) to compute eye position in the indirect path of the VOR, eye or head velocity signals are multiplied by eye position feedback and then integrated; consequently 2) eye position signals and eye or head velocity signals converge on vestibular neurons, and their interaction is multiplicative; 3) tonic neurons carrying different components of the eye position signal are interdependent, so malfunction of one component will affect the others; and 4) in the feedback control of saccades, the error signal is the desired position of the eye divided by the actual position.","citedby-count":"269","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010884","afid":"60010884","affilname":"Western University","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"pubmed-id":"3681398","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006141887","authid":"7006141887","authname":"Tweed D.","surname":"Tweed","given-name":"D.","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010884"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006778421","authid":"7006778421","authname":"Vilis T.","surname":"Vilis","given-name":"T.","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010884"}]}],"source-id":"23475","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0023453591"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0023453591?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0023453591&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0023453591&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0023453591","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0023453591","eid":"2-s2.0-0023453591","dc:title":"Spacecraft attitude determination using a second-order nonlinear filter","dc:creator":"Vathsal S.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics","prism:issn":"07315090","prism:volume":"10","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"559-566","prism:coverDate":"1987-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November-December 1987","prism:doi":"10.2514/3.20256","dc:description":"The stringent attitude determination accuracy and faster slew maneuver requirements demanded by present-day spacecraft control systems motivate the development of recursive nonlinear filters for attitude estimation. This paper presents the second-order filter development for the estimation of attitude quaternion using three-axis gyro and star tracker measurement data. Performance comparisons have been made by computer simulation of system models and filter mechanization. It is shown that the second-order filter consistently performs better than the extended Kalman filter when the performance index of the root sum square estimation error of the quaternion vector is compared. The second-order filter identifies the gyro drift rates faster than the extended Kalman filter. The uniqueness of this algorithm is the online generation of the time-varying process and measurement noise covariance matrices, derived as a function of the process and measurement nonlinearity, respectively. be.
