Our color image watermarking scheme consists of two parts, namely embedding and detecting. In the embedding process, we divide the color host image into non-overlapping blocks and compute the local QPCET of color image blocks and then insert the watermark signal into the robust local QPCET magnitudes through multiplicative approach. In the detecting phase, robust local QPCET magnitudes are firstly modeled by employing the Cauchy–Rayleigh distribution, where the statistical properties of local QPCET magnitudes are captured accurately. Then, genetic algorithm-based maximum likelihood approach is introduced to estimate the statistical parameters of Cauchy–Rayleigh distribution model. And finally a color image watermark detector for multiplicative watermarking is developed using Cauchy–Rayleigh distribution and locally most powerful test. Also, we utilize the Cauchy–Rayleigh statistical model to derive the closed-form expressions for the watermark detector. Experimental results on some standard test images and comparison with well-known existing methods demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of the proposed scheme.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017010","afid":"60017010","affilname":"Liaoning Normal University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16205443400","authid":"16205443400","authname":"Niu P.","surname":"Niu","given-name":"Panpan","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209282355","authid":"57209282355","authname":"Wang L.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Li","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222077864","authid":"57222077864","authname":"Tian J.","surname":"Tian","given-name":"Jialin","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202335087","authid":"57202335087","authname":"Zhang S.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Siyu","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972239800","authid":"34972239800","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiangyang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]}],"authkeywords":"Cauchy–Rayleigh distribution | Color image watermarking | GA-ML algorithm | LMP test | Local QPCET","source-id":"18780","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61472171","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85114714576"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85114714576?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85114714576&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85114714576&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85114714576","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85114714576","eid":"2-s2.0-85114714576","dc:title":"Contrast maintaining graying method based on quaternion chromaticity distance","dc:creator":"Zhao Y.","prism:publicationName":"Nanjing Li Gong Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Nanjing University of Science and Technology","prism:issn":"10059830","prism:volume":"45","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"472-480","prism:coverDate":"2021-08-30","prism:coverDisplayDate":"30 August 2021","prism:doi":"10.14177/j.cnki.32-1397n.2021.45.04.011","dc:description":"The traditional contrast maintaining graying method uses the Euclidean distance to calculate the contrast of color images. This method only considers the overall correlation of channels, and does not consider the correlation between channels, which may lead to noise or loss of details in the grayscale results. To solve this problem, a quaternion chromaticity distance measurement formula based on chromaticity plane projection is proposed by using quaternion correlation theory. A global chromaticity contrast measurement method based on random difference is proposed by using the formula and a local chromaticity contrast measurement method based on horizontal and vertical difference is proposed. The contrast maintaining objective function is constructed by using the contrast measurement method, and the optimal combination coefficients for grayscale mapping are determined by using the ideal of discrete approximate solution. The experimental results show that the method has good real-time performance and the obtained grayscale results can better maintain the contrast information of color details in the original color image.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025256","afid":"60025256","affilname":"Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010606","afid":"60010606","affilname":"East China Jiaotong University","affiliation-city":"Nanchang","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57255036000","authid":"57255036000","authname":"Zhao Y.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Yuxiao","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010606"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57255387600","authid":"57255387600","authname":"Li J.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Jianfei","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010606"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57213268188","authid":"57213268188","authname":"Zhu Z.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Zhiliang","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010606"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57255503100","authid":"57255503100","authname":"Duan R.","surname":"Duan","given-name":"Runtao","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010606"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56342421200","authid":"56342421200","authname":"Huang X.","surname":"Huang","given-name":"Xiaosheng","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010606"}]}],"authkeywords":"Chromaticity contrast | Chromaticity distance | Color image gray processing | Contrast maintaining | Quaternion","source-id":"13195","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85118996338"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85118996338?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85118996338&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85118996338&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85118996338","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85118996338","eid":"2-s2.0-85118996338","dc:title":"Phasor Quaternion Neural Network Framework and Its Significance in Big SAR Intelligence","dc:creator":"Hirose A.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the 2021 International Conference on Emerging Techniques in Computational Intelligence, ICETCI 2021","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781665415590"}],"prism:pageRange":"65-70","prism:coverDate":"2021-08-25","prism:coverDisplayDate":"25 August 2021","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICETCI51973.2021.9574064","dc:description":"In this paper, first we overview the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in observation and data processing in synthetic aperture radar (SAR).

To this end, this paper proposes a 3D object pose estimation method that is suitable for execution on embedded systems. Specifically, a novel multi-task objective function is proposed, in order to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract pose-related features from RGB images, which are subsequently utilized in a Nearest-Neighbor (NN) search-based post-processing step to obtain the final 3D object poses. By utilizing a symmetry-aware term and unit quaternions in the proposed objective function, our method yielded more robust and discriminative features, thus, increasing 3D object pose estimation accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art. In addition, the employed feature extraction network utilizes a lightweight CNN architecture, allowing execution on hardware with limited computational capabilities. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed method is also able to successfully generalize to previously unseen objects, without the need for extra training.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015331","afid":"60015331","affilname":"Aristotle University of Thessaloniki","affiliation-city":"Thessaloniki","affiliation-country":"Greece"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57212479498","authid":"57212479498","authname":"Papaioannidis C.","surname":"Papaioannidis","given-name":"Christos","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015331"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35569279700","authid":"35569279700","authname":"Pitas I.","surname":"Pitas","given-name":"Ioannis","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015331"}]}],"authkeywords":"3D object pose estimation | Convolutional Neural Networks | Multi-task learning","source-id":"21101062319","fund-acr":"H2020","fund-no":"731667","fund-sponsor":"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85112766590"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85112766590?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85112766590&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85112766590&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85112766590","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85112766590","eid":"2-s2.0-85112766590","dc:title":"Automatic keying algorithm for multi-category target recognition","dc:creator":"Mao L.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Physics: Conference Series","prism:issn":"17426588","prism:eIssn":"17426596","prism:volume":"1982","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-08-02","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2 August 2021","prism:doi":"10.1088/1742-6596/1982/1/012122","dc:description":"In this paper, through an in-depth study of the automatic keying algorithm for target recognition and using multi-class algorithms for its analysis, a saliency detection model based on the hypercomplex Fourier transform is proposed, which can quickly search for information related to the current task requirements.

However, the use of low-cost sensors has also been limited because their readings are easily distorted by unwanted internal and/or external noise signals such as environmental magnetic disturbance, which lead to errors in attitude and heading estimation results. In an extended Kalman filter (EKF) process, this study proposes a method for mitigating the effect of magnetic disturbance on attitude determination by using a double quaternion parameters for representation of orientation states, which decouples the magnetometer from attitude computation. Additionally, an online measurement error covariance matrix tuning system was implemented to reject the impact of magnetic disturbance on the heading estimation. Simulation and experimental tests were conducted to verify the performance of the proposed methods in resolving the magnetic noise effect on attitude and heading. The results showed that the proposed method performed better than complimentary, gradient descent, and single quaternion-based EKF.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008783","afid":"60008783","affilname":"Pusan National University","affiliation-city":"Busan","affiliation-country":"South Korea"}],"pubmed-id":"34450918","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57224223721","authid":"57224223721","authname":"Wondosen A.","surname":"Wondosen","given-name":"Assefinew","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008783"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56784864100","authid":"56784864100","authname":"Jeong J.S.","surname":"Jeong","given-name":"Jin Seok","initials":"J.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008783"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57226699109","authid":"57226699109","authname":"Kim S.K.","surname":"Kim","given-name":"Seung Ki","initials":"S.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008783"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57226687601","authid":"57226687601","authname":"Debele Y.","surname":"Debele","given-name":"Yisak","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008783"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401684853","authid":"7401684853","authname":"Kang B.S.","surname":"Kang","given-name":"Beom Soo","initials":"B.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008783"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude | Estimation | Extended Kalman filter | Heading | IMU sensor | Magnetic disturbance rejection","article-number":"5475","source-id":"130124","fund-acr":"MOTIE","fund-no":"N0002431","fund-sponsor":"Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85117282526"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85117282526?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85117282526&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85117282526&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85117282526","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85117282526","eid":"2-s2.0-85117282526","dc:title":"Polarization quaternion DOA estimation based on vector MISC array","dc:creator":"Shuai S.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","prism:issn":"16711793","prism:volume":"32","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"764-778","prism:coverDate":"2021-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 August 2021","prism:doi":"10.23919/JSEE.2021.000066","dc:description":"This paper examines the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation for polarized signals impinging on a sparse vector sensor array which is based on the maximum interelement spacing constraint (MISC).

One of their key features that is widely used in motion capturing applications is their capability of estimating the orientation of the device and, thus, the orientation of the limb it is attached to. However, tracking a human’s motion at reasonable sampling rates comes with the drawback that a substantial amount of data needs to be transmitted between devices or to an end point where all device data is fused into the overall body pose. The communication typically happens wirelessly, which severely drains battery capacity and limits the use time. In this paper, we introduce fastSW, a novel piecewise linear approximation technique that efficiently reduces the amount of data required to be transmitted between devices. It takes advantage of the fact that, during motion, not all limbs are being moved at the same time or at the same speed, and only those devices need to transmit data that actually are being moved or that exceed a certain approximation error threshold. Our technique is efficient in computation time and memory utilization on embedded platforms, with a maximum of 210 instructions on an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller.

In this paper, we propose a robust blind watermarking scheme based on quaternion QR decomposition (QQRD) for color image copyright protection, while using algebraic structure-preserving method to release its computational complexity. In watermark embedding process, QQRD is applied to non-overlapping 4×4 image blocks in a whole manner, whereupon three strong correlation coefficient pairs determined by the Normalized Cross-Correlation (NC) method are modified to embed color watermark within factorized matrices. This avoids layered processing that causes abnormal sensitivity to attacks and less correlation that causes excessive modification of coefficient values. Numerical results show that the newly proposed watermarking scheme has strong ability to resist most image processing attacks and is error-free under no attack, brightness adjustment attack and Poisson noise attack. Its superiority over other state-of-the-art methods is also experimentally demonstrated.","citedby-count":"27","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023813","afid":"60023813","affilname":"Shanghai University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004691","afid":"60004691","affilname":"Jiangsu Normal University","affiliation-city":"Xuzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216667311","authid":"57216667311","authname":"Chen Y.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Yong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8264355300","authid":"8264355300","authname":"Jia Z.G.","surname":"Jia","given-name":"Zhi Gang","initials":"Z.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004691"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36617766500","authid":"36617766500","authname":"Peng Y.","surname":"Peng","given-name":"Yan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55962184600","authid":"55962184600","authname":"Peng Y.X.","surname":"Peng","given-name":"Ya Xin","initials":"Y.X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188659040","authid":"57188659040","authname":"Zhang D.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Dan","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]}],"authkeywords":"Blind image watermarking | QQRD | Robustness | Structure-preserving method","article-number":"108088","source-id":"25548","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"11602133","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85103039231"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85103039231?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85103039231&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85103039231&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0096300321002861"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85103039231","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85103039231","eid":"2-s2.0-85103039231","dc:title":"Corrigendum to “Fractional-order quaternion exponential moments for color images” [Applied Mathematics and Computation 400 (2021) 126061] (Applied Mathematics and Computation (2021) 400, (S0096300321001090), (10.1016/j.amc.2021.126061))","dc:creator":"Wang C.","prism:publicationName":"Applied Mathematics and Computation","prism:issn":"00963003","prism:volume":"402","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 August 2021","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.amc.2021.126196","pii":"S0096300321002861","dc:description":"The authors regret <Correcting the information of the corresponding author, the correspondent author of this article is only Bin Ma, not Qixian Hao>.

The motivations of such forgery include hiding an element in the image or emphasizing a particular object. Copy-move image forgery is more challenging to detect than other types, such as splicing and retouching. In recent years, keypoint based copy-move forgery detection, which extracts image keypoints and uses local visual features to identify duplicated regions, exhibits remarkable performance with respect to memory requirement and robustness against various attacks. However, these approaches usually have poor detection ability when copy-move forgeries only involve small or smooth regions. Moreover, they cannot always effectively deal with multiple copy-move forgeries. To tackle these challenges, we propose a robust and effective multiple copy-move forgeries detection and localization method through adaptive keypoint extraction, robust local feature representation, and offsets clustering based post-processing. Firstly, we develop a new image keypoint detector, named generic features from accelerated segment test, and extract adaptively the uniform distribution keypoints from the forged image by employing the adaptive-thresholding and non-maximum suppression. Then, we introduce fast quaternion polar complex exponential transform to describe the image keypoints compactly and distinctively, and utilize the KD tree based K-nearest neighbor matching to find possible correspondences. Finally, the falsely matched pairs are removed by employing the offsets information based candidate clustering, and the duplicated regions are localized using RANSAC and ZNCC algorithm. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, in which encouraging results validate the effectiveness of the proposed technique, especially for plain/multiple copy-move forgeries, in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches recently proposed in the literature.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017010","afid":"60017010","affilname":"Liaoning Normal University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972239800","authid":"34972239800","authname":"Wang X.y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiang yang","initials":"X.y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57253631600","authid":"57253631600","authname":"Wang C.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Chao","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209282355","authid":"57209282355","authname":"Wang L.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Li","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972350300","authid":"34972350300","authname":"Yang H.y.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Hong ying","initials":"H.y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16205443400","authid":"16205443400","authname":"Niu P.p.","surname":"Niu","given-name":"Pan pan","initials":"P.p.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]}],"authkeywords":"Copy-move forgery detection | FQPCET | GFAST | Offsets clustering","source-id":"24822","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61472171","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85100966346"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85100966346?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85100966346&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85100966346&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85100966346","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85100966346","eid":"2-s2.0-85100966346","dc:title":"Virtual simulation of otolith movement for the diagnosis and treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo","dc:creator":"Kong L.","prism:publicationName":"Biomedizinische Technik","prism:issn":"00135585","prism:volume":"66","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"387-393","prism:coverDate":"2021-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 August 2021","prism:doi":"10.1515/bmt-2020-0278","dc:description":"Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a clinical condition. The existing diagnostic methods cannot determine the specific location of otolith on the short or long brachial sides. Thus, visual and quantitative evaluation of the existing clinical standard diagnostic modality Dix-Hallpike test is needed to improve medical efficiency. Our goal was to develop a real-time virtual simulation system to assess a BPPV treatment manipulation. In this study, we used the proposed simulation system to observe otolith movement during a posterior semicircular canal BPPV diagnostic test, and to analyze the diagnostic mechanisms and strategies. Through visual cluster analysis of otolith position and analysis of otolith movement time in the standard Dix-Hallpike test, we can find that the positions of otoliths are relatively scattered, especially on the z-axis (z1 = 10.67 ± 3.98), and the fall time of otoliths at different positions has relatively large changes (t1 = 22.21 ± 1.40). But in the modified experiment z2 = 4.93 ± 0.32 and t2 = 26.21 ± 0.28. The experimental results show that the simulation system could track the state and the movement of otolith in real-time, which is of great significance for understanding the diagnostic mechanisms of BPPV evaluations and improving the diagnostic method.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60122345","afid":"60122345","affilname":"Wenzhou People's Hospital","affiliation-city":"Wenzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60117399","afid":"60117399","affilname":"Suzhou Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Suzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007381","afid":"60007381","affilname":"Yangzhou University","affiliation-city":"Yangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"33567178","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222011327","authid":"57222011327","authname":"Kong L.","surname":"Kong","given-name":"Lingyi","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007381"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56247138700","authid":"56247138700","authname":"Wu J.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Jun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007381"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222024000","authid":"57222024000","authname":"Feng M.","surname":"Feng","given-name":"Mingjie","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007381"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57362507900","authid":"57362507900","authname":"Zhang Y.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Yin","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60117399"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55265778400","authid":"55265778400","authname":"Liu Z.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Zhaobang","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60117399"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189854934","authid":"57189854934","authname":"Yang X.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Xiaokai","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122345"}]}],"authkeywords":"Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo | Dix-hallpike test | Posterior semicircular canals | Virtual simulation system","source-id":"28621","fund-acr":"NKRDPC","fund-no":"2016YFC0103502","fund-sponsor":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85117418756"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85117418756?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85117418756&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85117418756&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85117418756","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85117418756","eid":"2-s2.0-85117418756","dc:title":"Multiple color medical images zero-watermark scheme based on quaternion generalized Fourier descriptor and QR code","dc:creator":"Wang B.","prism:publicationName":"ACM International Conference Proceeding Series","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781450385671"}],"prism:pageRange":"248-253","prism:coverDate":"2021-07-30","prism:coverDisplayDate":"30 July 2021","prism:doi":"10.1145/3472634.3474079","dc:description":"Most of the existing zero-watermark algorithms for medical images are only applicable to grayscale images, and when they protect the copyright of a large number of medical images, the repetitive operation will bring a lot of time and storage costs. Therefore, to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a zero-watermark scheme for multiple color medical images based on quaternion generalized Fourier descriptor(QGFD) and QR code. QGFD is used to calculate the feature invariants of each color medical image, then the representative features of each image are selected to form the feature matrix, and binarize it to get the binary feature image, finally, the zero-watermark image can be obtained by performing an XOR operation on the scrambled copyright image and feature image.

In the quaternion algebra framework, we statistically eliminate the autocorrelation noise by using the properties of circular signals. The noise elimination provides a high-resolution performance for the algorithm at a low SNR.

According to the differences of the energy distribution of the virtual image formed by the color-block on the surfaces with different levels of roughness, a pure quaternion data structure was used to characterize a color image and the data was analyzed. The singular value entropy was extracted as the evaluation index, and the feasibility of evaluating ground surface roughness was demonstrated based on singular value entropy index. The experimental results show that the singular value entropy of color images is a reasonable and feasible surface roughness evaluation index, and has a reasonable data structure expression in a mathematical sense.

However, previous methods still often reconstruct temporally noisy pose and mesh sequences given in-the-wild video data. To address this problem, we propose a human pose refinement network (HPR-Net) based on a non-local attention mechanism. The pipeline of the proposed framework consists of a weight-regression module, a weighted-averaging module, and a skinned multi-person linear (SMPL) module. First, the weight-regression module creates pose affinity weights from a 3D human pose sequence represented in a unit quaternion form. Next, the weighted-averaging module generates a refined 3D pose sequence by performing temporal weighted averaging using the generated affinity weights. Finally, the refined pose sequence is converted into a human mesh sequence using the SMPL module. HPR-Net is a simple but effective post-processing network that can substantially improve the accuracy and temporal smoothness of 3D human mesh sequences obtained from an input video by existing human mesh reconstruction methods. Our experiments show that the noisy results of the existing methods are consistently improved using the proposed method on various real datasets. Notably, our proposed method reduces the pose and acceleration errors of VIBE, the existing state-of-the-art human mesh reconstruction method, by 1.4% and 66.5%, respectively, on the 3DPW dataset.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013866","afid":"60013866","affilname":"Kwangwoon University","affiliation-city":"Seoul","affiliation-country":"South Korea"}],"pubmed-id":"34283128","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57225021063","authid":"57225021063","authname":"Kim D.Y.","surname":"Kim","given-name":"Do Yeop","initials":"D.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013866"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7601552767","authid":"7601552767","authname":"Chang J.Y.","surname":"Chang","given-name":"Ju Yong","initials":"J.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013866"}]}],"authkeywords":"3D human mesh reconstruction | 3D human pose estimation | Deep neural network","article-number":"4572","source-id":"130124","fund-acr":"KW University","fund-no":"SRFC-IT1901-06","fund-sponsor":"Samsung","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85108207513"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85108207513?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85108207513&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85108207513&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85108207513","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85108207513","eid":"2-s2.0-85108207513","dc:title":"On computing the determinant, other characteristic polynomial coefficients, and inverse in Clifford algebras of arbitrary dimension","dc:creator":"Shirokov D.S.","prism:publicationName":"Computational and Applied Mathematics","prism:issn":"22383603","prism:eIssn":"18070302","prism:volume":"40","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2021","prism:doi":"10.1007/s40314-021-01536-0","dc:description":"In this paper, we solve the problem of computing the inverse in Clifford algebras of arbitrary dimension. We present basis-free formulas of different types (explicit and recursive) for the determinant, other characteristic polynomial coefficients, adjugate, and inverse in real Clifford algebras (or geometric algebras) over vector spaces of arbitrary dimension n. The formulas involve only the operations of multiplication, summation, and operations of conjugation without explicit use of matrix representation. We use methods of Clifford algebras (including the method of quaternion typification proposed by the author in previous papers and the method of operations of conjugation of special type presented in this paper) and generalizations of numerical methods of matrix theory (the Faddeev–LeVerrier algorithm based on the Cayley–Hamilton theorem; the method of calculating the characteristic polynomial coefficients using Bell polynomials) to the case of Clifford algebras in this paper. We present the construction of operations of conjugation of special type and study relations between these operations and the projection operations onto fixed subspaces of Clifford algebras. We use this construction in the analytical proof of formulas for the determinant, other characteristic polynomial coefficients, adjugate, and inverse in Clifford algebras. The basis-free formulas for the inverse give us basis-free solutions to linear algebraic equations, which are widely used in computer science, image and signal processing, physics, engineering, control theory, etc. The results of this paper can be used in symbolic computation.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025404","afid":"60025404","affilname":"Institute for Information Transmission Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Moscow","affiliation-country":"Russian Federation"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020513","afid":"60020513","affilname":"HSE University","affiliation-city":"Moscow","affiliation-country":"Russian Federation"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25629062100","authid":"25629062100","orcid":"0000-0002-2407-9601","authname":"Shirokov D.S.","surname":"Shirokov","given-name":"D.

For efficient analysis of such quaternionic signals, we introduce the notion of linear canonical wavelet transform in quaternion domain by invoking the elegant convolution structure associated with the quaternion linear canonical transform. The preliminary analysis encompasses the study of fundamental properties of the proposed linear canonical wavelet transform in quaternion domain including the Rayleigh’s theorem, inversion formula and a characterization of the range. Subsequently, we formulate three uncertainty principles; viz, Heisenberg-type, logarithmic and local uncertainty inequalities associated with the linear canonical wavelet transform in quaternion domain.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016300","afid":"60016300","affilname":"University of Kashmir","affiliation-city":"Srinagar","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35100992700","authid":"35100992700","authname":"Shah F.A.","surname":"Shah","given-name":"Firdous A.","initials":"F.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016300"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57213148331","authid":"57213148331","authname":"Teali A.A.","surname":"Teali","given-name":"Aajaz A.","initials":"A.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016300"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57200797998","authid":"57200797998","authname":"Tantary A.Y.","surname":"Tantary","given-name":"Azhar Y.","initials":"A.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016300"}]}],"authkeywords":"Linear canonical transform | Quaternion Fourier transform | Uncertainty principles | Wavelet transform","article-number":"42","source-id":"4900152804","fund-acr":"डीएसटी","fund-no":"EMR/2016/007951","fund-sponsor":"Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85105542807"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85105542807?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85105542807&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85105542807&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85105542807","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85105542807","eid":"2-s2.0-85105542807","dc:title":"Correction to: Conformal Mappings Revisited in the Octonions and Clifford Algebras of Arbitrary Dimension (Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras, (2020), 30, 3, (36), 10.1007/s00006-020-01063-x)","dc:creator":"Kraußhar R.S.","prism:publicationName":"Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras","prism:issn":"01887009","prism:eIssn":"16614909","prism:volume":"31","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2021","prism:doi":"10.1007/s00006-021-01140-9","dc:description":"The article Conformal Mappings Revisited in the Octonions and Clifford Algebras of Arbitrary Dimension, written by Rolf Soren Kraußharwas originally published Online First without Open Access.
