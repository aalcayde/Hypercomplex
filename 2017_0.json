It also follows the avalanche effect by yielding 50% different result with achange of one bit in the key and effectively withstands a bruteforce and other types of decryption attacks. In this paper, authors have implemented the existing algorithm and subsequently modified it by splitting the image matrix into four smaller matrices instead of two as in the existing algorithm and performing parallel execution of those matrices in group of two to improve the execution time of the algorithm. Thus, it executes faster without affecting or compromising with the image qualityimplying that the strength of the encryption algorithm is not affected as the modification is made only to the way algorithm executes without interfering with the internal structure of the algorithm.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007102","afid":"60007102","affilname":"Dr. B.R.

Quaternion theory is used for expressing the color difference between two pixels. It considers both the intensity and chromaticity differences. The proposed algorithm is a two-stage scheme. In the first stage, an impulse noise detector is developed to discriminate the color pixels which are likely corrupted by noise. The image is enhanced in the second stage by replacing the noisy pixels with the output of the commonly used vector median filter computed in quaternion form. The obtained results show that the proposed filter achieves good filtering performance over other existing filters. It integrates the advantages of quaternion expression of color images which preserve vector nature by treating it as single entity and robust impulse detection by MAD.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60107385","afid":"60107385","affilname":"National Institute of Technology Nagaland","affiliation-city":"Dimapur","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60107383","afid":"60107383","affilname":"National Institute of Technology Manipur","affiliation-city":"Imphal","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57200826477","authid":"57200826477","authname":"Chanu P.R.","surname":"Chanu","given-name":"Palungbam Roji","initials":"P.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60107385"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55665304800","authid":"55665304800","authname":"Singh K.M.","surname":"Singh","given-name":"Khumanthem Manglem","initials":"K.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60107383"}]}],"authkeywords":"impulse noise | MAD | quaternion | vector median","source-id":"31517","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048560359"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048560359?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85048560359&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85048560359&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048560359","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85048560359","eid":"2-s2.0-85048560359","dc:title":"External hybrid force/pose controller for manipulator robots using dual quaternion algebra","dc:creator":"Alb√°n D.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - 2017 LARS 14th Latin American Robotics Symposium and 2017 5th SBR Brazilian Symposium on Robotics, LARS-SBR 2017 - Part of the Robotics Conference 2017","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538609569"}],"prism:volume":"2017-December","prism:pageRange":"1-6","prism:coverDate":"2017-12-15","prism:coverDisplayDate":"15 December 2017","prism:doi":"10.1109/SBR-LARS-R.2017.8215334","dc:description":"This paper presents an external hybrid force/pose controller for a robotic manipulator using a cascade scheme with two control loops. In the outer loop there is a force controller that acts as a perturbation for the position reference, whose purpose is to regulate the force applied by the end-effector during the interaction; the inner loop, which is used to control the end-effector pose (i.e., position and orientation), uses both the signals generated by the outer loop and the desired end-effector pose. The controller design relies on the interaction of the end-effector with the environment by using only the robot kinematics. Both robot modeling and controller design are done by using dual quaternion algebra. Simulations on the V-REP platform are performed to verify the proposed scheme. The results show that the force is maintained constant while the trajectory tracking is achieved with a variation produced by the regulation of the desired interaction force in the outer loop.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030074","afid":"60030074","affilname":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais","affiliation-city":"Belo Horizonte","affiliation-country":"Brazil"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202497164","authid":"57202497164","authname":"Alb√°n D.","surname":"Alb√°n","given-name":"Diana Sabina","initials":"D.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030074"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35408793200","authid":"35408793200","authname":"Adorno B.","surname":"Adorno","given-name":"Bruno Vilhena","initials":"B.V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030074"}]}],"source-id":"21100864434","fund-acr":"CAPES","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Coordena√ß√£o de Aperfei√ßoamento de Pessoal de N√≠vel Superior","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85046686164"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85046686164?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85046686164&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85046686164&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85046686164","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85046686164","eid":"2-s2.0-85046686164","dc:title":"Satellite image denoising via adjustment of the quaternionic wavelet coefficients","dc:creator":"Kadiri M.","prism:publicationName":"2017 5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering - Boumerdes, ICEE-B 2017","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538606865"}],"prism:volume":"2017-January","prism:pageRange":"1-6","prism:coverDate":"2017-12-12","prism:coverDisplayDate":"12 December 2017","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICEE-B.2017.8192127","dc:description":"This paper describes an approach to images denoising using relationship between the quaternionic wavelet coefficients for use in remote sensing applications.

Denoising is based the spatial-spectral mutual neighborhood where quaternionic magnitude coefficients are thresholded in local window. In addition to magnitude, the phase variations in the same scale are exploited in a global schema. Our method is applied to satellite images representing regions of Algeria.

The multistate activation function has been used in complex-valued Hopfield neural networks (CHNNs). It is useful for representing multilevel information, and the CHNNs with a multistate activation function have been applied to the storage of multilevel data, such as gray-scale images. A twin-multistate activation function consists of two multistate activation functions. Quaternionic Hopfield neural networks (QHNNs) with a twin-multistate activation function can take the place of the CHNNs with a multistate activation function. The QHNNs require half the number of connection parameters of CHNNs. Projection rule is a fast learning algorithm, and is suitable under restricted computational power. However, it requires full-connection, and the sparse connections are not allowed. Projection rule is also available for the QHNNs with a twin-multistate activation function. When the memory resource and computational power are restricted, the QHNNs with a twin-multistate activation function is useful. In the present work, the conventional network topology is only considered. To take advantage of non-commutativity of quaternions, several researchers proposed network topology for QHNNs, such as dual connections. In future, the QHNNs with a twin-multistate activation function will be extended to those with such network topology.","citedby-count":"42","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009064","afid":"60009064","affilname":"University of Yamanashi","affiliation-city":"Kofu","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55741799500","authid":"55741799500","orcid":"0000-0002-4453-0615","authname":"Kobayashi M.","surname":"Kobayashi","given-name":"Masaki","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009064"}]}],"authkeywords":"Complex-valued neural network | Hopfield neural network | Multistate neuron | Projection rule | Quaternion","source-id":"24807","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85041530163"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85041530163?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85041530163&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85041530163&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85041530163","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85041530163","eid":"2-s2.0-85041530163","dc:title":"Design and implementation of reversible integer quaternionic paraunitary filter banks on adder-based distributed arithmetic","dc:creator":"Petrovsky N.A.","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing - Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications Conference Proceedings, SPA","prism:issn":"23260262","prism:eIssn":"23260319","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9788362065301"}],"prism:volume":"2017-September","prism:pageRange":"17-22","prism:coverDate":"2017-12-04","prism:coverDisplayDate":"4 December 2017","prism:doi":"10.23919/SPA.2017.8166830","dc:description":"This paper presents a design method of reversible integer quaternionic paraunitary filter banks (Int-Q-PUFB) using the adder-based distributed arithmetic (DAŒ£) for implementation multiplier block-lifting structure modules.

Every unit provides 3D (3-dimension) acceleration, 3D angular velocity, 3D magnetic field orientation, and 4D quaternions. This system identifies 33 different physical activities (walking, running, cycling, lateral elevation of arms, etc.). The system is composed of two main modules: a feature extractor for obtaining the most relevant characteristics from the inertial signals every second, and a machine learning algorithm for classifying between the different activities. This paper focuses on the feature extractor module, evaluating several types of features and proposing different normalization approaches. This paper also analyses the performance of every sensor included in the inertial measurement units. The main experiments have been done using a public available dataset named REALDISP Activity Recognition dataset. This dataset includes recordings from 17 subjects performing 33 different activities in three different scenarios. Final results demonstrate that the proposed HAR system significantly improves the classification accuracy compared to previous works on this dataset. For the best configuration, the system accuracy is 99.1%. This system has been also evaluated with the OPPORTUNITY dataset obtaining competitive results.","citedby-count":"43","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028442","afid":"60028442","affilname":"Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid","affiliation-city":"Madrid","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016930","afid":"60016930","affilname":"Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190380876","authid":"57190380876","authname":"Zhu J.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Jiadong","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016930"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8333266700","authid":"8333266700","authname":"San-Segundo R.","surname":"San-Segundo","given-name":"Rub√©n","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028442"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193752834","authid":"57193752834","authname":"Pardo J.M.","surname":"Pardo","given-name":"Jos√© M.","initials":"J.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028442"}]}],"authkeywords":"Feature extraction robustness | Human activity recognition | Machine learning | OPPORTUNITY dataset | Pattern recognition | Physical activity recognition | Random forest | REALDISP activity recognition dataset | Signal normalization | Type of sensor","source-id":"21100358314","fund-acr":"CSC","fund-no":"DPI2014‚Äë53525‚ÄëC3‚Äë2‚ÄëR","fund-sponsor":"China Scholarship Council","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherhybridgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Hybrid Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85032653827"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85032653827?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85032653827&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85032653827&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0021904517301107"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85032653827","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85032653827","eid":"2-s2.0-85032653827","dc:title":"Quaternionic B-splines","dc:creator":"Hogan J.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Approximation Theory","prism:issn":"00219045","prism:eIssn":"10960430","prism:volume":"224","prism:pageRange":"43-65","prism:coverDate":"2017-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2017","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jat.2017.09.003","pii":"S0021904517301107","dc:description":"We introduce B-splines Bq of quaternionic order q, defined on the real line for the purposes of multi-channel signal analysis.

A special case of our result is to show that the 2D generalized prolate spheroidal wave signals obtained by Slepian can be used to achieve a sampling series of cube-bandlimited signals. The solutions of energy concentration problems in quaternion Fourier transform are also investigated.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194324445","authid":"57194324445","authname":"Cheng D.","surname":"Cheng","given-name":"Dong","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003837546","authid":"7003837546","authname":"Kou K.I.","surname":"Kou","given-name":"Kit Ian","initials":"K.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]}],"authkeywords":"Prolate spheroidal wave function | Quaternion Fourier transform | Quaternion reproducing-kernel Hilbert spaces | Spectral theorem | Whittaker-Shannon-Kotel‚Äônikov sampling formula","source-id":"4900152804","fund-acr":"UM","fund-no":"MYRG2015-00058-L2-FST","fund-sponsor":"Universidade de Macau","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85029953826"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85029953826?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85029953826&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85029953826&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85029953826","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85029953826","eid":"2-s2.0-85029953826","dc:title":"Heading estimation fusing inertial sensors and landmarks for indoor navigation using a smartphone in the pocket","dc:creator":"Deng Z.","prism:publicationName":"Eurasip Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking","prism:issn":"16871472","prism:eIssn":"16871499","prism:volume":"2017","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2017-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 December 2017","prism:doi":"10.1186/s13638-017-0941-0","dc:description":"Principal component analysis (PCA)-based approach for user heading estimation using a smartphone in the pocket suffers from an inaccurate estimation of device attitude, which plays a central role in both obtaining acceleration signals in the horizontal plane and the ultimate global walking direction extraction. To solve this problem, we propose a novel heading estimation approach based on two unscented Kalman filters (UKFs) fusing inertial sensors and landmarks. The first UKF is developed for the recalibration of device attitude estimation. We mathematically derive the measurement equation connecting observed user heading from landmarks with the quaternion vector representing device attitude. To decrease the nonlinearity of the measurement equation and make the filter more robust, we deploy the difference between user heading derived from the landmark and estimation result of PCA-based approach as the observation variable. The second UKF is developed for user heading estimation fusing estimation results of PCA-based approach and observed user headings from landmarks. Besides, we develop a robust landmark identification method by exploiting the acceleration and device pitch patterns, while noisy barometers are no longer required as previous methods. Experiments show that the proposed landmark-aided user heading estimation approach may improve accuracy performance significantly, which is very useful for continuous indoor navigation.","citedby-count":"17","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029322","afid":"60029322","affilname":"Dalian Maritime University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004538","afid":"60004538","affilname":"Dalian University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003353","afid":"60003353","affilname":"Harbin Engineering University","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35434952400","authid":"35434952400","authname":"Deng Z.","surname":"Deng","given-name":"Zhian","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003353"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36350068100","authid":"36350068100","authname":"Si W.","surname":"Si","given-name":"Weijian","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003353"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23393601300","authid":"23393601300","authname":"Qu Z.","surname":"Qu","given-name":"Zhiyu","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003353"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56098131900","authid":"56098131900","authname":"Liu X.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Xin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23390150000","authid":"23390150000","authname":"Na Z.","surname":"Na","given-name":"Zhenyu","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029322"}]}],"authkeywords":"Indoor navigation | Principal component analysis (PCA) | Unscented Kalman filter | User heading estimation","article-number":"160","source-id":"18202","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61301131","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028920692"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028920692?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85028920692&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85028920692&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028920692","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85028920692","eid":"2-s2.0-85028920692","dc:title":"Spectral Analysis of Stationary Random Bivariate Signals","dc:creator":"Flamant J.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","prism:issn":"1053587X","prism:volume":"65","prism:issueIdentifier":"23","prism:pageRange":"6135-6145","prism:coverDate":"2017-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 December 2017","prism:doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2736494","dc:description":"A novel approach toward the spectral analysis of stationary random bivariate signals is proposed.

Using the quaternion Fourier transform, we introduce a quaternion-valued spectral representation of random bivariate signals seen as complex-valued sequences. This makes possible the definition of a scalar quaternion-valued spectral density and the corresponding autocovariance for bivariate signals. This spectral density can be meaningfully interpreted in terms of frequency-dependent polarization attributes. A natural decomposition of the spectral density of any random bivariate signal in terms of unpolarized and polarized components is introduced.

Ischaemic condition caused by a decrease in the blood supply in a cardiac region induces hypoxia and metabolic abnormalities that contribute to the electrical instability of the heart and to the development of slow conduction in damaged tissue. Methods: Herein, a percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography (PTCA) is considered as a model of supply ischaemia. We use the concept of quaternion to develop a robust method for assessing the angular velocity of cardiac vector in the orthogonal XYZ leads obtained from 92 patients undergoing the PTCA procedure. The maxima of angular velocity in both ventricular depolarization and repolarization are combined with traditional linear velocity indexes in order to obtain a detector of ischaemic episodes (Ischaemia Detector, ID). Results: ID achieves 98%/100% of sensitivity/specificity when differentiating healthy subjects from patients with early ischaemia. Furthermore, it also shows high accuracy when the comparison is made between ischaemic subjects and patients with different non-ischaemic pathologic ST-deviations which are known to cause false positives, reaching 95%/98% of sensitivity/specificity. Moreover, the study of significant reductions (p<0.001) of angular velocity components allows extraction of distinct ischaemic common features which are useful for analyzing the dependence of vectorcardiogram signal on each site of occlusion. The sensitivity of injury location reaches values of 88% (RCA), 87% (LAD) and 80% (LCx). Conclusions: The high performance of the proposed method establishes a promising outcome for application in computerized assistance in clinical practice.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004518","afid":"60004518","affilname":"Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient√≠ficas y T√©cnicas","affiliation-city":"Buenos Aires","affiliation-country":"Argentina"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001563","afid":"60001563","affilname":"Universidad de Buenos Aires","affiliation-city":"Buenos Aires","affiliation-country":"Argentina"}],"pubmed-id":"28689986","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56562887200","authid":"56562887200","orcid":"0000-0002-6127-5994","authname":"Cruces P.D.","surname":"Cruces","given-name":"Pablo Daniel","initials":"P.D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001563"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004518"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602348313","authid":"6602348313","authname":"Arini P.D.","surname":"Arini","given-name":"Pedro David","initials":"P.D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001563"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004518"}]}],"authkeywords":"Damaged area location | Non-invasive method | Percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography","source-id":"23774","fund-acr":"CONICET","fund-no":"PIP #112-20130100552CO","fund-sponsor":"Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient√≠ficas y T√©cnicas","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85017148349"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85017148349?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85017148349&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85017148349&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0736584516302873"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85017148349","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85017148349","eid":"2-s2.0-85017148349","dc:title":"Welding torch attitude-based study of human welder interactive behavior with weld pool in GTAW","dc:creator":"Zhang G.","prism:publicationName":"Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing","prism:issn":"07365845","prism:volume":"48","prism:pageRange":"145-156","prism:coverDate":"2017-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 December 2017","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.rcim.2017.03.009","pii":"S0736584516302873","dc:description":"Skilled human welder adjusts welding parameters including the welding torch attitude, moving speed and position to control weld quality and avoid weld defects based on real time observed varying weld pool surface for precision joining using gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). However, welder behavior/adjustment appears to be a complex reactive response. To understand this complex response and develop intelligent robotic arc welding, a new scheme that correlated welding torch attitude to weld pool surface to study welder behavior in torch adjustment as response to weld pool was proposed and realized. The torch attitude and the 3D weld pool surface were synchronously measured using a wire inertial measuring unit (IMU) and a laser vision-based approach. An image processing algorithm was developed to extract the characteristic parameters of the weld pool surface from the laser stripes reflected by the specular pool surface. The improved quaternion-based unscented Kalman filter was used to estimate the torch orientation from its inertial measurement data, showing that the torch attitude has been obtained with an acceptable error in the order of 1¬∞(x axis and y axis) and 2¬∞(z axis). Several experiments were performed and the correlation of the corresponding data was detailed. It indicates that the change of torch attitude represents the welder's operating skills, welding experience and smart decision. The three characteristic parameters reflect the welder's reactive response on the torch adjustments. The curvature radius of laser stripes can predict the changing trends of the weld pool surface, providing the needed information for welders to make a smart decision. The proposed scheme is feasible for measuring and analyzing the welder's skills and experience.","citedby-count":"14","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025945","afid":"60025945","affilname":"Lanzhou University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Lanzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56447271200","authid":"56447271200","authname":"Zhang G.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Gang","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025945"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55715066700","authid":"55715066700","authname":"Shi Y.","surname":"Shi","given-name":"Yu","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025945"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55781017200","authid":"55781017200","authname":"Gu Y.","surname":"Gu","given-name":"Yu Fen","initials":"Y.F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025945"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/22978823700","authid":"22978823700","authname":"Fan D.","surname":"Fan","given-name":"Ding","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025945"}]}],"authkeywords":"Fluid flow | GTAW | Human welder behavior | Weld pool surface | Welding torch attitude","source-id":"18080","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"J201201-2012","fund-sponsor":"Natural Science Foundation of Jilin Province","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85013117892"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85013117892?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85013117892&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85013117892&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85013117892","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85013117892","eid":"2-s2.0-85013117892","dc:title":"Biquaternion beamspace with its application to vector-sensor array direction findings and polarization estimations","dc:creator":"Li D.","prism:publicationName":"Eurasip Journal on Advances in Signal Processing","prism:issn":"16876172","prism:eIssn":"16876180","prism:volume":"2017","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2017-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 December 2017","prism:doi":"10.1186/s13634-017-0451-6","dc:description":"In this paper, a biquaternion beamspace, constructed by projecting the original data of an electromagnetic vector-sensor array into a subspace of a lower dimension via a quaternion transformation matrix, is first proposed. To estimate the direction and polarization angles of sources, biquaternion beamspace multiple signal classification (BB-MUSIC) estimators are then formulated. The analytical results show that the biquaternion beamspaces offer us some additional degrees of freedom to simultaneously achieve three goals. One is to save the memory spaces for storing the data covariance matrix and reduce the computation efforts of the eigen-decomposition. Another is to decouple the estimations of the sources‚Äô polarization parameters from those of their direction angles.

It is also shown that the existing biquaternion multiple signal classification (BQ-MUSIC) estimator is a specific case of our BB-MUSIC ones.

The improved QR fully utilizes the four-dimensional quaternion domain.

The calibration is carried out using a 2-axial motion simulator. A new computational method is investigated for the calibration coefficients of the error models of accelerometers and gyroscopes of the strapdown inertial navigation system based on the errors of the system output signals. The modified navigation algorithms of the 3-channel strapdown inertial navigation system are used. The algorithms of the system orientation and navigation are generated using the kinematic Poisson's equations and the basic equation of the inertial navigation in the quaternion form. Damping links are introduced into the algorithms; they have been built based on the errors in the linear velocity computing and errors of the orientation angles computed as a difference between the system data and the motion simulator data. As a result, the vector and quaternion dependences are obtained to calculate the signals of the accelerometers and gyroscopes; they are used to calculate the instrumental errors and calibration coefficients of the error models. The increased calibration accuracy of the system is achieved by the reduction of the signals' noisiness of the accelerometers and gyroscopes after they have been processed with the modified algorithms and as a result of eliminating the symmetry requirement of the calibration coefficients in the opposite positions of the simulator as well as a result of the instrumental errors consideration for the motion simulator.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023325","afid":"60023325","affilname":"Perm National Research Polytechnic University","affiliation-city":"Perm","affiliation-country":"Russian Federation"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56315404100","authid":"56315404100","authname":"Nikolaev S.G.","surname":"Nikolaev","given-name":"S.

Pedestrian Dead-Reckoning (PDR) is a kind of low-cost location positioning technique that can get high accuracy by estimating the heading angle of target from acceleration, gyro and compass data. Usually, researchers use compass data to estimate heading angle. However, the compass data is easily affected by external environment, such as electrical equipment or some objects made by iron or steel. On the other hand, the calculation results by the obtained data of acceleration and gyro usually have accumulated error with time. When time comes longer, the bigger error often appears. Some researchers use Wi-Fi based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) to assist PDR for correction. However, some Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) cannot be used because RSSI can be affected by external factors, such as people moving, wall. In this paper, a novel method that can improve PDR by heading correction is proposed. In this method, heading angle is estimated by calculating the yaw angle with Quaternion from acceleration and gyro data, and optimal APs selection method is used to select suitable RSSI for getting high accuracy.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023462","afid":"60023462","affilname":"Waseda University","affiliation-city":"Tokyo","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/11939923500","authid":"11939923500","authname":"Tateno S.","surname":"Tateno","given-name":"Shigeyuki","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023462"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201298242","authid":"57201298242","authname":"Cho Y.","surname":"Cho","given-name":"Yitong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023462"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201298202","authid":"57201298202","authname":"Li D.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Dunghan","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023462"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57224794384","authid":"57224794384","authname":"Tian H.","surname":"Tian","given-name":"Hao","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023462"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201301459","authid":"57201301459","authname":"Hsiao P.","surname":"Hsiao","given-name":"Pengyu","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023462"}]}],"authkeywords":"Indoor Positioning | Optimal AP Selection | PDR | Quaternion | RSSI","source-id":"21100855894","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85034100296"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85034100296?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85034100296&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85034100296&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85034100296","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85034100296","eid":"2-s2.0-85034100296","dc:title":"Human actions analysis: Templates generation, matching and visualization applied to motion capture of highly-skilled karate athletes","dc:creator":"Hachaj T.","prism:publicationName":"Sensors (Switzerland)","prism:issn":"14248220","prism:volume":"17","prism:issueIdentifier":"11","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2017-11-10","prism:coverDisplayDate":"10 November 2017","prism:doi":"10.3390/s17112590","dc:description":"The aim of this paper is to propose and evaluate the novel method of template generation, matching, comparing and visualization applied to motion capture (kinematic) analysis. To evaluate our approach, we have used motion capture recordings (MoCap) of two highly-skilled black belt karate athletes consisting of 560 recordings of various karate techniques acquired with wearable sensors. We have evaluated the quality of generated templates; we have validated the matching algorithm that calculates similarities and differences between various MoCap data; and we have examined visualizations of important differences and similarities between MoCap data. We have concluded that our algorithms works the best when we are dealing with relatively short (2-4 s) actions that might be averaged and aligned with the dynamic time warping framework. In practice, the methodology is designed to optimize the performance of some full body techniques performed in various sport disciplines, for example combat sports and martial arts. We can also use this approach to generate templates or to compare the correct performance of techniques between various top sportsmen in order to generate a knowledge base of reference MoCap videos. The motion template generated by our method can be used for action recognition purposes. We have used the DTW classifier with angle-based features to classify various karate kicks. We have performed leave-one-out action recognition for the Shorin-ryu and Oyama karate master separately. In this case, 100% actions were correctly classified. In another experiment, we used templates generated from Oyama master recordings to classify Shorin-ryu master recordings and vice versa. In this experiment, the overall recognition rate was 94.2%, which is a very good result for this type of complex action.","citedby-count":"34","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017351","afid":"60017351","affilname":"AGH University of Krakow","affiliation-city":"Krakow","affiliation-country":"Poland"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015509","afid":"60015509","affilname":"Uniwersytet Pedagogiczny im.

However, one recent QWT has been found in the form of a pair of filters with quaternion coefficients. Our aim is to extend this work by finding more such QWTs. We solve equations that the filter coefficients must satisfy using algebraic and numerical methods and find a new QWT. We plot the functions associated with the pre-existing QWT and our new one and then use the two pairs of filters on the same colour vector image. This is the first time that this form of QWT has been demonstrated. Finally, we consider how we can extend our work and find more QWTs.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001359","afid":"60001359","affilname":"University of Essex","affiliation-city":"Colchester","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15832064200","authid":"15832064200","authname":"Fletcher P.","surname":"Fletcher","given-name":"Peter","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001359"}]}],"article-number":"8101619","source-id":"21100847436","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
