By introducing Quaternion Gabor analysis into image representation, we make full use of the interrelationship among different color channels to enhance the performance of the face recognition system. Moreover, the QGF are used to encode the positions and attributes of the face elements. Non-parametric transformation is then imposed on these QGF using LBP method to obtain the robustness against variations of pose, illumination and facial expressions. Compared with the monochromatic face recognition systems, which nowadays dominate the marketplace and research field, this approach materializes the strong potential use of color face recognition system by establishing invariant quaternion wavelet features of color images. The experimental results on the open face database testify the validity of the proposed method under severe noise corruption and distinct variations of scale, illumination and facial expressions. ©2008 IEEE.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025641","afid":"60025641","affilname":"Universität Freiburg","affiliation-city":"Freiburg im Breisgau","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025084","afid":"60025084","affilname":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57716169400","authid":"57716169400","authname":"Lu W.","surname":"Lu","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55695017800","authid":"55695017800","authname":"Xu Y.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Yi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7406503333","authid":"7406503333","authname":"Yang X.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Xiaokang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025641"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402537534","authid":"7402537534","authname":"Song L.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Li","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color face recognition | Local binary pattern | Quaternionic gabor feature","article-number":"4517716","source-id":"110544","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/51349112876"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/51349112876?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=51349112876&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=51349112876&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/51349112876","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:51349112876","eid":"2-s2.0-51349112876","dc:title":"Hypercomplex model of acoustic vector sensor array with its application for the high resolution two dimensional direction of arrival estimation","dc:creator":"You H.W.","prism:publicationName":"Conference Record - IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference","prism:issn":"10915281","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"1424415411"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781424415410"}],"prism:pageRange":"1-5","prism:coverDate":"2008-09-15","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2008","prism:doi":"10.1109/IMTC.2008.4546993","dc:description":"In this paper, a hypercomplex model of acoustic vector sensor arrays is first introduced.

Our approach consists of introducing an auxiliary dynamical system whose output (which is also a unit quaternion) is used in the control law together with the unit quaternion representing the attitude tracking error. Roughly speaking, the necessary damping that would have been achieved by the direct use of the angular velocity can be achieved, in our approach, by the vector part̄q of the error signal between the output of the auxiliary system and the unit quaternion tracking error. The resulting velocity-free control scheme guarantees almost global asymptotic stability which is as strong as the topology of the motion space can permit. In the regulation case, our control law is a pure quaternion feedback (i.e., consisting of two terms that are vector parts of unit-quaternion), and hence, the control torques are naturally bounded by the control gains. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. © 2008 IEEE.","citedby-count":"280","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025949","afid":"60025949","affilname":"Lakehead University","affiliation-city":"Thunder Bay","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003694697","authid":"7003694697","authname":"Tayebi A.","surname":"Tayebi","given-name":"Abdelhamid","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025949"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude tracking | Output feedback | Rigid body","source-id":"17339","fund-acr":"NSERC","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/49249135508"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/49249135508?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=49249135508&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=49249135508&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/49249135508","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:49249135508","eid":"2-s2.0-49249135508","dc:title":"A new color pattern recognition algorithm based on quaternion correlation","dc:creator":"Qi Q.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of 2008 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control, ICNSC","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781424416851"}],"prism:pageRange":"462-466","prism:coverDate":"2008-08-18","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2008","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICNSC.2008.4525261","dc:description":"Quaternion correlation, which uses a quaternion to represent the R, G, B value of a pixel in color images, takes advantage of high recognizing precision and strong noise tolerance.

Power-scaling and constellation-rotation of information symbols have been incorporated in order to extend the signalling set. The proposed coding scheme achieves a 75% rate enhancement in comparison to the traditional Alamouti [3] code for QPSK modulation without requiring any additional system resources, e.g. power or bandwidth. The use of power-scaling and constellation-rotation also guarantee full-rank of codeword difference matrices in the extended set, while maximizing the coding gain and minimizing the transmitted signal peak-to-average power ratio. We propose a reduced-complexity efficient decoding algorithm, which does not result in any loss of useful information in comparison to the full-length ML decoding. The proposed high-rate code can also be utilized to provide unequal error protection to two different levels of source bits and hence, is useful in applications where the notion of unequal error protection supports varying degree of fidelity to source data, for example multimedia communications. Extensions to general M-PSK constellations and code design for more than 2 transmit antennas are straightforward. © 2008 IEEE.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016561","afid":"60016561","affilname":"Philips Research","affiliation-city":"Eindhoven","affiliation-country":"Netherlands"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55994846500","authid":"55994846500","authname":"Das S.","surname":"Das","given-name":"Sushanta","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016561"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7203046714","authid":"7203046714","authname":"Ghosh M.","surname":"Ghosh","given-name":"Monisha","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016561"}]}],"authkeywords":"Quaternion | Rate Compatible Punctured Convolutional Code (RCPC) | Space-Time Block Code (STBC) | Unequal Error Protection (UEP)","article-number":"4525897","source-id":"23922","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/46449130084"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/46449130084?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=46449130084&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=46449130084&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0065230X08000079"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/46449130084","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:46449130084","eid":"2-s2.0-46449130084","dc:title":"Tumor-Microenvironment Interactions: Dangerous Liaisons","dc:creator":"Witz I.P.","prism:publicationName":"Advances in Cancer Research","prism:issn":"0065230X","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780123743589"}],"prism:volume":"100","prism:pageRange":"203-229","prism:coverDate":"2008-07-10","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2008","prism:doi":"10.1016/S0065-230X(08)00007-9","pii":"S0065230X08000079","dc:description":"The interaction between microenvironmental components and tumor cells is bidirectional. Tumor cells and their products are capable of regulating and altering gene expression in nontumor cells residing in or infiltrating into the microenvironment and exert selective pressures on such cells, thereby shaping their phenotype. Conversely, microenvironmental components regulate gene expression in tumor cells thereby directing the tumor into one or several possible molecular evolution pathways, some of which may lead to metastasis. This review summarizes six instances in which the tumor liaises with different components of its microenvironment. These liaisons result, in most cases, in enhanced tumor progression. In these cases (responses of tumor and nontumor cells to microenvironmental stress, the interaction of the tumor with fibroblasts, endothelial cells and macrophages, the formation of the metastatic niche, and the interaction of the tumor with immunoglobulins) the tumor, directly or indirectly, alters the phenotype of its interaction partners thereby enlisting them to promote its progression. Does the tumor need all these pathways to form metastasis? Is there a hierarchy of interactions with respect to impact on tumor progression?. These questions remain open. They may be answered by approaches employed in the analysis of hypercomplex systems. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The resulting animation, generated in real-time, is a blend of key animations provided a priori by the animator. The blending is done with the help of efficient dual-quaternion transformation blending. The user's point of view is tracked using either computer vision techniques or a simple user-controlled input modality, such as mouse-based input. This tracked point of view is then used to suitably select the blend of animations.

The QWT is a near shift-invariant tight frame representation whose coefficients sport a magnitude and three phases: two phases encode local image shifts while the third contains image texture information. The QWT is based on an alternative theory for the 2-D Hilbert transform and can be computed using a dual-tree filter bank with linear computational complexity. To demonstrate the properties of the QWT's coherent magnitude/phase representation, we develop an efficient and accurate procedure for estimating the local geometrical structure of an image. We also develop a new multiscale algorithm for estimating the disparity between a pair of images that is promising for image registration and flow estimation applications.

The algorithm matches stars in an image taken with the camera to stars in a star catalogue. The algorithm is based on a geometric voting scheme in which a pair of stars in the catalogue votes for a pair of stars in the image if the angular distance between the stars of both pairs is similar. As angular distance is a symmetric relationship, each of the two catalogue stars votes for each of the image stars. The identity of each star in the image is set to the identity of the catalogue star that cast the most votes. Once the identity of the stars is determined, the attitude of the camera is computed using a quaternion-based method. We further present a fast tracking algorithm that estimates the attitude for subsequent images after the first algorithm has terminated successfully. Our method runs in comparable speed to state of the art algorithms but is still more robust than them. The system has been implemented and tested on simulated data and on real sky images. © 2008 IEEE.","citedby-count":"122","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022403","afid":"60022403","affilname":"Technion - Israel Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Haifa","affiliation-country":"Israel"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002999","afid":"60002999","affilname":"University of Haifa","affiliation-city":"Haifa","affiliation-country":"Israel"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/106020203","afid":"106020203","affilname":"Ness Technologies Ltd.","affiliation-city":"Tel Aviv-Yafo","affiliation-country":"Israel"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15623178600","authid":"15623178600","authname":"Kolomenkin M.","surname":"Kolomenkin","given-name":"Michael","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022403"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24492612000","authid":"24492612000","authname":"Pollak S.","surname":"Pollak","given-name":"Sharon","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"106020203"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003816361","authid":"7003816361","authname":"Shimshoni I.","surname":"Shimshoni","given-name":"Ilan","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002999"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005025258","authid":"7005025258","authname":"Lindenbaum M.","surname":"Lindenbaum","given-name":"Michael","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022403"}]}],"authkeywords":"Brightness | Calibration | Cameras | Distance measurement | Estimation | Least squares approximation | Robustness","source-id":"17336","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/44349178047"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/44349178047?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=44349178047&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=44349178047&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/44349178047","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:44349178047","eid":"2-s2.0-44349178047","dc:title":"Polarized signal classification by complex and quaternionic multi-layer perceptrons","dc:creator":"Buchholz S.","prism:publicationName":"International Journal of Neural Systems","prism:issn":"01290657","prism:volume":"18","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"75-85","prism:coverDate":"2008-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2008","prism:doi":"10.1142/S0129065708001403","pii":"S0129065708001403","dc:description":"For polarized signals, which arise in many application fields, a statistical framework in terms of quaternionic random processes is proposed.

So the behavior segmentation of motion data is a key problem in the process of motion capture. In order to segment the motion data into small clips, a new symbolic representation of motion capture data is introduced and a behavior segmentation approach based on the representation is explored. The high dimensional motion capture data are first mapped on a low dimensional space, based on spectral clustering and sliding-window-distance extending weighted quaternion distances. Then the low dimensional data can be represented by a character string, called motion string (MS), and by temporal reverting and max filtering. Because MS converts motion data into a character string, lots of string analysis methods can be used for motion processing. In addition to motion segmentation, motion string may be widely applied in various other areas such as motion retrieval and motion compression. Suffix trees are used to segment the motion data by extracting all static substrings and periodic substrings from MS. Each substring represents a behavior segment, and the motion data are segmented into distinct behavior segments by annotating these substrings. In the experiments, MS is proved to be a powerful concept for motion segmentation, providing the good performance.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013789","afid":"60013789","affilname":"Beihang University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54407869800","authid":"54407869800","authname":"Yang Y.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Yuedong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013789"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57207491164","authid":"57207491164","authname":"Wang L.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Lili","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013789"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36445833300","authid":"36445833300","authname":"Hao A.","surname":"Hao","given-name":"Aimin","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013789"}]}],"authkeywords":"Motion capture | Motion edit | Motion segmentation | Motion string | Sliding-window distance | Spectral clustering","source-id":"26714","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/40549127493"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/40549127493?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=40549127493&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=40549127493&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/40549127493","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:40549127493","eid":"2-s2.0-40549127493","dc:title":"Robust 3-D motion tracking from stereo images: A model-less method","dc:creator":"Yu Y.K.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","prism:issn":"00189456","prism:volume":"57","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"622-630","prism:coverDate":"2008-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"March 2008","prism:doi":"10.1109/TIM.2007.911641","dc:description":"Traditional vision-based 3-D motion-estimation algorithms require given or calculated 3-D models while the motion is being tracked. We propose a high-speed extended-Kalman-filter-based approach that recovers camera position and orientation from stereo image sequences without prior knowledge, as well as the procedure for the reconstruction of 3-D structures. Empowered by the use of a trifocal tensor, the computation step of 3-D models can be eliminated. The algorithm is thus flexible and can be applied to a wide range of domains. The twist motion model is also adopted to parameterize the 3-D motion. It is minimal since it only has six parameters as opposed to seven parameters in quaternion and 12 parameters in matrix representation. The motion representation is robust because it does not suffer from singularities as Euler angles. Due to the fact that the number of parameters to be estimated is reduced, our algorithm is more efficient, stable, and accurate than traditional approaches. The proposed method has been applied to recover the motion from stereo image sequences taken by a robot and a handheld stereo rig. The results are accurate compared to the ground truths. It is shown in the experiment that our algorithm is not susceptible to outlying point features with the application of a validation gate. © 2008 IEEE.","citedby-count":"37","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002798","afid":"60002798","affilname":"Chinese University of Hong Kong","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25928883300","authid":"25928883300","authname":"Yu Y.K.","surname":"Yu","given-name":"Ying Kin","initials":"Y.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002798"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404758551","authid":"7404758551","authname":"Wong K.H.","surname":"Wong","given-name":"Kin Hong","initials":"K.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002798"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006594248","authid":"7006594248","authname":"Or S.H.","surname":"Or","given-name":"Siu Hang","initials":"S.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002798"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404503948","authid":"7404503948","authname":"Chang M.M.Y.","surname":"Chang","given-name":"Michael Ming Yuen","initials":"M.M.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002798"}]}],"authkeywords":"Kalman filtering | Pose tracking | Robot vision | Stereo vision | Structure and motion | Trifocal tensor | Twist | Visual servoing","source-id":"15361","fund-acr":"CUHK","fund-no":"2050350","fund-sponsor":"Chinese University of Hong Kong","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/39449125016"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/39449125016?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=39449125016&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=39449125016&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/39449125016","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:39449125016","eid":"2-s2.0-39449125016","dc:title":"Color image watermarking using multidimensional fourier transforms","dc:creator":"Tsui T.K.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","prism:issn":"15566013","prism:volume":"3","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"16-28","prism:coverDate":"2008-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"March 2008","prism:doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2007.916275","dc:description":"This paper presents two vector watermarking schemes that are based on the use of complex and quaternion Fourier transforms and demonstrates, for the first time, how to embed watermarks into the frequency domain that is consistent with our human visual system. Watermark casting is performed by estimating the just-noticeable distortion of the images, to ensure watermark invisibility. The first method encodes the chromatic content of a color image into the CIE a*b* chromaticity coordinates while the achromatic content is encoded as CIE L tris-timulus value. Color watermarks (yellow and blue) are embedded in the frequency domain of the chromatic channels by using the spatiochromatic discrete Fourier transform. It first encodes a* and b* as complex values, followed by a single discrete Fourier transform. The most interesting characteristic of the scheme is the possibility of performing watermarking in the frequency domain of chromatic components. The second method encodes the L*a*b* components of color images and watermarks are embedded as vectors in the frequency domain of the channels by using the quaternion Fourier transform. Robustness is achieved by embedding a watermark in the coefficient with positive frequency, which spreads it to all color components in the spatial domain and invisibility is satisfied by modifying the coefficient with negative frequency, such that the combined effects of the two are insensitive to human eyes. Experimental results demonstrate that the two proposed algorithms perform better than two existing algorithms-ac- and discrete cosine transform-based schemes. © 2008 IEEE.","citedby-count":"206","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60101612","afid":"60101612","affilname":"Research in Motion Limited","affiliation-city":"Waterloo","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030838","afid":"60030838","affilname":"Toronto Metropolitan University","affiliation-city":"Toronto","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000251","afid":"60000251","affilname":"IEEE","affiliation-city":"New York","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16069461900","authid":"16069461900","authname":"Tsui T.K.","surname":"Tsui","given-name":"Tsz Kin","initials":"T.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000251"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60101612"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35214025100","authid":"35214025100","authname":"Zhang X.P.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xiao Ping","initials":"X.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000251"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030838"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004043485","authid":"7004043485","authname":"Androutsos D.","surname":"Androutsos","given-name":"Dimitrios","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000251"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030838"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color | Data hiding | Digital image watermarking | Quaternion Fourier transform (QFT) | Spatiochromatic discrete Fourier transform (SCDFT)","source-id":"4000149002","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34848884864"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34848884864?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=34848884864&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=34848884864&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0022247X07007470"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34848884864","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:34848884864","eid":"2-s2.0-34848884864","dc:title":"Characterizing the Hilbert transform by the Bedrosian theorem","dc:creator":"Venouziou M.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications","prism:issn":"0022247X","prism:eIssn":"10960813","prism:volume":"338","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"1477-1481","prism:coverDate":"2008-02-15","prism:coverDisplayDate":"15 February 2008","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jmaa.2007.05.067","pii":"S0022247X07007470","dc:description":"It is proved that a bounded linear translation invariant operator on L2 (Rd) satisfies the Bedrosian theorem if and only if it is a linear combination of the compositions of the partial Hilbert transforms and the identity operator.

The signal processing model for EM-sensor mounted on the airframe is made by biquaternion and then the eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of spectral matrix is obtained by means of the EVD of its quaternion adjoint matrix. The memory requirement for data is reduced, and more accurate estimation result is gotten by deducing the stronger orthogonality constraint between the singal and noise subspaces on the field of biquaternion. The performance of the new algorithm is confirmed through numerical examples.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073486","afid":"60073486","affilname":"Aviation University of Air Force","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201756504","authid":"57201756504","authname":"Cui W.","surname":"Cui","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073486"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8534150300","authid":"8534150300","authname":"Tao J.W.","surname":"Tao","given-name":"Jian Wu","initials":"J.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073486"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55715427000","authid":"55715427000","authname":"Liu L.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Liang","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073486"}]}],"authkeywords":"DOA | Eigenvalue decomposition | Electromagnetic-sensor arrays quaternion | Polarization estimation","source-id":"15141","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
