The controller has been realized by means of a Multi Input Multi Output (MIMO) fuzzy controller with a knowledge base composed by 75 logic rules (25 logic rules for per axis). The input-domains are partitioned with 5 membership functions, resulting in 25 fuzzy rules for each rule-base. The output-domains are partitioned with 7 membership functions. The Mamdani controllers use a standard max-min inference process and a fast center of area method to calculate the crisp control signals. The satellite control is obtained autonomously by the fuzzy controller generating commands to the hybrid actuators. The actuator set combined from magnetorquers and reaction wheel to facilitate three axes maneuver. Using hybrid actuators solve the singularity problem that often occurs in active magnetic control methods. IGRF2000 was used as earth magnetic field simulation. Effects of the environmental disturbances during Attitude maneuver of the SC have been considered by developing a disturbance torques simulator module. The main features of the proposed control strategy are: simplicity in spacecraft control system design and development, increased robustness for automatic control reconfiguration and model uncertainty, reduction in development and production cost for flight control systems, autonomous on-board control features. Numerical simulations show the capabilities of the proposed approaches compared to the other classical methods (PD) such as quaternion feedback and Euler Angles feedback control laws. © 2011 IEEE.","citedby-count":"3","prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56045441700","authid":"56045441700","authname":"Ousaloo H.S.","surname":"Ousaloo","given-name":"Hamed Shahmohamadi","initials":"H.S."}],"article-number":"6356632","source-id":"21100932858","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84872439736"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84872439736?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84872439736&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84872439736&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84872439736","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84872439736","eid":"2-s2.0-84872439736","dc:title":"Quaternion moment invariant for color image","dc:creator":"Zhu M.","prism:publicationName":"Chinese Optics","prism:issn":"20971842","prism:volume":"4","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"497-502","prism:coverDate":"2011-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"October 2011","dc:description":"In order to study moment invariants of color images, the quaternion is used to process color images and to implement the parallel processing of R, G and B components.

In order to finish work-pieces registration, a method is proposed based on affine invariant. After the CAD model data and actual measurement data of a work-piece are acquired, the method consists of the following five steps: sampling point clouds data, extracting characteristic four-points set, searching characteristic congruent four-points set, computing transformation congruent matrix and the last, further precise point clouds data registration. Point clouds data of CAD and measuring model are sampled respectively through calculating the curvature of the two sets of data and selecting the obvious curvature points as their reduced characteristic points. Based on this, the characteristic four-points set from the reduced ones of CAD model and the corresponding matching congruent four-points set of the measuring model are extracted according to RANSAC algorithm. The rotation matrix R and translation vector T of any two matching four-points are then calculated through the algorithm of quaternion. After that, the measuring model is rotated and translated and then compared with the CAD model data, the most congruent transformation matrix is selected as the coarse registration result. Furthermore, Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is applied to the congruent transformation to improve registration precision. The experiment shows that the run time of the algorithm is 129.56s and mean-error of point-to-point distance is 0.062mm when accessing measuring model data more than 80000 points. Compared with the traditional curvature registration, the experiment also shows that the algorithm is more efficient and robust when the volume of point clouds data is larger. © 2011 SPIE.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/112918932","afid":"112918932","affilname":"Beijing Information Science Anf Technology University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56134655500","authid":"56134655500","authname":"Chen M.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Meng","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"112918932"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58456213200","authid":"58456213200","authname":"Yan B.","surname":"Yan","given-name":"Bixi","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"112918932"}]}],"authkeywords":"affine invariant | ICP algorithm | point cloud | RANSAC | registration","article-number":"82011Q","source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84861373415"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84861373415?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84861373415&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84861373415&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84861373415","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84861373415","eid":"2-s2.0-84861373415","dc:title":"Segmentation of three-dimensional EBSD data through fast multiscale clustering","dc:creator":"McMahon C.","prism:publicationName":"TMS Annual Meeting","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781617827389"}],"prism:volume":"1","prism:pageRange":"185-192","prism:coverDate":"2011-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2011","prism:doi":"10.1002/9781118495285.ch23","dc:description":"Complete and accurate analysis of subgrain microstructural features must include three-dimensional information. Three-dimensional electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) data can be used to characterize these features; however their boundaries first must be determined. This cannot be accomplished simply with pixel-to-pixel misorientation thresholding because many of the boundaries are gradual transitions in crystallographic orientation. Fast Multiscale Clustering (FMC) is an established image processing technique that we have combined with quaternion representation of orientation to segment this kind of data. Segmentation algorithms often have issues handling images with both distinct and subtle boundaries. Our implementation of FMC addresses this by using a novel distance function and statistical analysis to take into account the variance in orientation of each feature. Although FMC was originally a two-dimensional image processing algorithm it can be generalized to analyze three-dimensional data sets. As an example, a segmentation of microbands in cold-rolled aluminum is presented.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028333","afid":"60028333","affilname":"UNSW Sydney","affiliation-city":"Sydney","affiliation-country":"Australia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000812","afid":"60000812","affilname":"Harvey Mudd College","affiliation-city":"Claremont","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56678962800","authid":"56678962800","authname":"McMahon C.","surname":"McMahon","given-name":"Cullen","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000812"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54882742500","authid":"54882742500","authname":"George C.","surname":"George","given-name":"Cassandra","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000812"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603710687","authid":"6603710687","authname":"Quadir M.Z.","surname":"Quadir","given-name":"Md Zakaria","initials":"M.Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028333"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005135028","authid":"7005135028","authname":"Ferry M.","surname":"Ferry","given-name":"Michael","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028333"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603643806","authid":"6603643806","authname":"Bassman L.","surname":"Bassman","given-name":"Lori","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000812"}]}],"authkeywords":"Electron backscatter diffraction | Fast multiscale clustering | Segmentation | Three-Dimensional ebsd","source-id":"70943","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80053137687"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80053137687?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80053137687&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80053137687&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80053137687","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:80053137687","eid":"2-s2.0-80053137687","dc:title":"PD+ based output feedback attitude control of rigid bodies with improved performance","dc:creator":"Schlanbusch R.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the American Control Conference","prism:issn":"07431619","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781457700804"}],"prism:pageRange":"833-838","prism:coverDate":"2011-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2011","prism:doi":"10.1109/acc.2011.5991389","dc:description":"We address the problem of output feedback attitude control of a rigid body in quaternion coordinate space through a modified PD+ based tracking controller. The control law ensures faster convergence to the desired operating point during attitude maneuver, while keeping the gains small for station keeping, thus being less sensitive to measurement noise. The angular velocity is estimated with a similar technique, thus keeping the property of lower sensitivity to measurement noise. A direct consequence is a drop in energy consumption and more accurate estimation results when affected by sensor noise. More precisely, we show uniform practical asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point for the closed loop system in the presence of unknown, bounded input disturbances. Simulation results illustrate the performance improvement with respect to PD+ based output feedback control with static gains. © 2011 AACC American Automatic Control Council.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021255","afid":"60021255","affilname":"UiT Norges Arktiske Universitet","affiliation-city":"Tromso","affiliation-country":"Norway"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008134","afid":"60008134","affilname":"CNRS Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique","affiliation-city":"Paris","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24450992100","authid":"24450992100","authname":"Schlanbusch R.","surname":"Schlanbusch","given-name":"Rune","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021255"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24787713400","authid":"24787713400","authname":"Loría A.","surname":"Loría","given-name":"Antonio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008134"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8651748400","authid":"8651748400","authname":"Kristiansen R.","surname":"Kristiansen","given-name":"Raymond","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021255"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8651748300","authid":"8651748300","authname":"Nicklasson P.J.","surname":"Nicklasson","given-name":"Per Johan","initials":"P.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021255"}]}],"article-number":"5991389","source-id":"18692","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80052068801"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80052068801?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80052068801&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80052068801&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80052068801","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:80052068801","eid":"2-s2.0-80052068801","dc:title":"Quaternion photometric stereo for rotation invariant surface texture classification","dc:creator":"Sathyabama B.","prism:publicationName":"American Journal of Applied Sciences","prism:issn":"15469239","prism:eIssn":"15543641","prism:volume":"8","prism:issueIdentifier":"10","prism:pageRange":"992-996","prism:coverDate":"2011-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2011","prism:doi":"10.3844/ajassp.2011.992.996","dc:description":"Problem statement: The escalating growth of computer vision applications has increased the need for faster and more accurate image analysis algorithms. One application of image analysis that has been studied for a long time is texture analysis. The majority of existing texture analysis methods makes the explicit or implicit assumption that texture images are acquired from the same viewpoint. This study presents a rotationally invariant descriptor for textures with different orientations based on the Quaternion Representation. Approach: A novel Quaternion Photometric Stereo (QPS) was proposed for Rotation invariant classification of 3D surface textures. QPS was constructed by placing each pixel of three images of same texture with different orientation into the three imaginary parts of the quaternion, leaving the real part zero. The Peak Distribution Norm Vector (PDNV) was extracted from the radial plot of the Quaternion Fourier spectrum as rotation invariant texture signature used for texture classification. Results: The quaternion representation of stereo images was to be effective in the context of Rotation Invariant Texture classification. Conclusion: The proposed Quaternion approach gives a successful classification rate with computational advantages than the previously developed Monochrome and Color Photometric Stereo Methods. © 2011 Science Publications.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033058","afid":"60033058","affilname":"Thiagarajar College of Engineering","affiliation-city":"Madurai","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57220039118","authid":"57220039118","authname":"Sathyabama B.","surname":"Sathyabama","given-name":"Balakrishnan","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033058"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58463002800","authid":"58463002800","authname":"Raju S.","surname":"Raju","given-name":"Srinivan","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033058"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/48561946400","authid":"48561946400","authname":"Varadhan A.","surname":"Varadhan","given-name":"Abhaikumar","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033058"}]}],"authkeywords":"Monochrome and color photometric stereo | Peak distribution norm vector (PDNV) | Quaternion fourier spectrum | Quaternion photometric stereo (QPS) | Radial plot","source-id":"6400153122","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherhybridgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Hybrid Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80051546829"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80051546829?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80051546829&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80051546829&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80051546829","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:80051546829","eid":"2-s2.0-80051546829","dc:title":"Hypercomplex mathematical morphology","dc:creator":"Angulo J.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision","prism:issn":"09249907","prism:volume":"41","prism:issueIdentifier":"1-2","prism:pageRange":"86-108","prism:coverDate":"2011-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"September 2011","prism:doi":"10.1007/s10851-011-0266-2","dc:description":"The natural ordering of grey levels is used in classical mathematical morphology for scalar images to define the erosion/dilation and the evolved operators. Various operators can be sequentially applied to the resulting images always using the same ordering. In this paper we propose to consider the result of a prior transformation to define the imaginary part of a complex image, where the real part is the initial image. Then, total orderings between complex numbers allow defining subsequent morphological operations between complex pixels. More precisely, the total orderings are lexicographic cascades with the local modulus and phase values of these complex images. In this case, the operators take into account simultaneously the information of the initial image and the processed image. In addition, the approach can be generalized to the hypercomplex representation (i.e., real quaternion) by associating to each image three different operations, for instance directional filters. Total orderings initially introduced for colour quaternions are used to define the evolved morphological transformations. Effects of these new operators are illustrated with different examples of filtering. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030506","afid":"60030506","affilname":"Mines Paris - PSL","affiliation-city":"Paris","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102728753","authid":"7102728753","authname":"Angulo J.","surname":"Angulo","given-name":"Jesús","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030506"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adjunction | Complex images | Complex ordering | Hypercomplex ordering | Mathematical morphology | Nonlinear image filtering | Quaternion","source-id":"28501","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79961080172"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79961080172?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=79961080172&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=79961080172&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79961080172","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:79961080172","eid":"2-s2.0-79961080172","dc:title":"Hypercomplex polar fourier analysis for image representation","dc:creator":"Yang Z.","prism:publicationName":"IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems","prism:issn":"09168532","prism:eIssn":"17451361","prism:volume":"E94-D","prism:issueIdentifier":"8","prism:pageRange":"1663-1670","prism:coverDate":"2011-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"August 2011","prism:doi":"10.1587/transinf.E94.D.1663","dc:description":"Fourier transform is a significant tool in image processing and pattern recognition. By introducing a hypercomplex number, hypercomplex Fourier transform treats a signal as a vector field and generalizes the conventional Fourier transform. Inspired from that, hypercomplex polar Fourier analysis that extends conventional polar Fourier analysis is proposed in this paper. The proposed method can handle signals represented by hypercomplex numbers as color images. The hypercomplex polar Fourier analysis is reversible that means it can be used to reconstruct image. The hypercomplex polar Fourier descriptor has rotation invariance property that can be used for feature extraction. Due to the noncommutative property of quaternion multiplication, both left-side and right-side hypercomplex polar Fourier analysis are discussed and their relationships are also established in this paper. The experimental results on image reconstruction, rotation invariance, color plate test and image retrieval are given to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method as an image analysis tool.

Then, another form of the QMMSE algorithm based on the complex-expansion of the quaternion (QCMMSE) is derived. The difference of the two algorithms and the computational complexity are analyzed. Finally, the QMMSE algorithm is applied to the beamforming of an airborne trimmed vector-sensor array.

An efficient and robust new method is sought that does not require optimization and is less susceptible to noise. Methods: A new quaternion-based affine registration algorithm for matching 3D point sets, a generalization of a previously reported method for 2D point sets, was developed. The new algorithm computes the exact affine transformation and the unknown correspondence between two 3D point sets but does not require any optimization. The method performs robustly in the presence of noise for non-degenerate cases. The method performs a reduction of general affine case to an orthogonal case, and then computes the unknown rotation using the quaternion representation of the 3D points. The method assumes no prior knowledge of point-wise correspondence between the two point sets. The algebraic and geometric concepts underlying the method are shown to be both clear and intuitive. Results: Experimental evaluation of the method was performed using both randomly generated synthetic 3D point sets and Stanford Bunny dataset. The algorithm performed well even for noisy data. A feasibility test was performed with medical MR scans showing promising results. Conclusion: The algorithm for point-based correspondence registration demonstrated robust results, even in noisy cases, and was shown to be feasible for use with medical images. © CARS 2010.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028970","afid":"60028970","affilname":"Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School","affiliation-city":"Piscataway","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017366","afid":"60017366","affilname":"IBM Thomas J.

It is necessary to process properly to use some signal processing techniques especially for high dimensional signals. As a mathematical description language, geometric algebra (GA) provides not only a powerful algebraic framework for the multi-dimensional vector analysis and computing, but also a unified measurement and geometrical description for different geometric models. On the basis of the GA theories, a new signal analysis method of the THz-TDS is presented. Based on the characteristics of THz-TDS signals, signals are mapped into vectors in the high-dimensional real vector space. The vectors are represented with hyper-complex numbers. We can analyze the vectors using theories of GA. Based on the physical mechanism of the THz-TDS signal analysis, geometric distribution properties and algebraic relationships of THz-TDS signals are deduced. It is demonstrated that every complex refractive index of the sample relates to a unique 2-blade B2, all vectors corresponding to the samples of the same substance are collinear and belong to the intrinsic 2-blade of the substance. In projective interpretation, the 2-blade B2 represents a fixed line and all vectors related to the same substance are along that line. Accordingly, a novel substance identification method based on the relative THz-TDS is presented. In the method, two THz-TDS signals through the samples of the same substance but different thickness are measured. The intrinsic 2-blade B2 of the substance is then determined by the outer product of these two corresponding vectors. Using the conformal split by the fixed bivector B2, each vector corresponding to THz-TDS signals in the vector space Vn can be linearly splitted into vectors in vector spaces V 2 and Vn-2. Since that 2-dimensional subspace V 2 is the support of B2, the subspace is also a label for substances. So substances of samples can be identified on the magnitudes of projection vectors in that subspace. This method can contribute to the accurate classification and identification, and facilitate the feature extraction. Finally, experiments are presented and show that the substance identification method is feasible and effective.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025578","afid":"60025578","affilname":"Xidian University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000937","afid":"60000937","affilname":"Shenzhen University","affiliation-city":"Shenzhen","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401940431","authid":"7401940431","authname":"Xie W.","surname":"Xie","given-name":"Weixin","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000937"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57276245000","authid":"57276245000","authname":"Li J.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Jing","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000937"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7103298591","authid":"7103298591","authname":"Pei J.","surname":"Pei","given-name":"Jihong","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000937"}]}],"article-number":"012227","source-id":"130053","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79953220552"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79953220552?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=79953220552&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=79953220552&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79953220552","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:79953220552","eid":"2-s2.0-79953220552","dc:title":"Video quality assessment based on quaternion singular value decomposition","dc:creator":"Zhang F.Q.","prism:publicationName":"Tien Tzu Hsueh Pao/Acta Electronica Sinica","prism:issn":"03722112","prism:volume":"39","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"219-223","prism:coverDate":"2011-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"January 2011","dc:description":"Accurate objective quality metric is crucial for various video processing applications.

Inserting the estimated DOA into the traditional V-MUSIC algorithm, the polarization parameters of polarized signals are estimated. Thus, four unknown parameters of polarized signals are obtained.

The main idea of the proposed approach combines a quaternion-based nonlinear observer with an Iterated Least Squares Algorithm (ILSA) and exploits measurements from Micro-Electro-Mechanical-System (MEMS) sensors as 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis magnetometer and 3-axis gyroscope to produce attitude estimates during the entire range of the observed animal's body movements. Moreover, the proposed observer allows estimating the bias in gyroscope which is used to correct the angular velocity measurements in the attitude estimation step. Since, biologists use an index of DBA for evaluating the energy consumption of the moving animal; the resulting estimations are then used to extract the Dynamic Body Acceleration (DBA) of the animal. Note that, this work is necessary in Bio-logging science and allows monitoring aspects of animal's biology (behavior, movement, and physiology) and environments. The performance of the algorithm is theoretically proven and illustrated by an attitude estimation example. Moreover, the efficiency of the proposed approach is shown with a set of experiments through sensor measurements provided by an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). We have also included some comparison results with another method already applied in Bio-logging field in order to point out the improvements issued from the proposed approach. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
