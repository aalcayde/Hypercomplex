In this work, we present a method to extract probabilistic estimates of rotation from deep regression models. First, we build on prior work and develop a multi-headed network structure we name HydraNet that can account for both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Second, we extend HydraNet to targets that belong to the rotation group, SO(3), by regressing unit quaternions and using the tools of rotation averaging and uncertainty injection onto the manifold to produce three-dimensional covariances. Finally, we present results and analysis on a synthetic dataset, learn consistent orientation estimates on the 7-Scenes dataset, and show how we can use our learned covariances to fuse deep estimates of relative orientation with classical stereo visual odometry to improve localization on the KITTI dataset.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016849","afid":"60016849","affilname":"University of Toronto","affiliation-city":"Toronto","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56202208000","authid":"56202208000","authname":"Peretroukhin V.","surname":"Peretroukhin","given-name":"Valentin","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016849"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201129557","authid":"57201129557","authname":"Wagstaff B.","surname":"Wagstaff","given-name":"Brandon","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016849"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57210998988","authid":"57210998988","authname":"Kelly J.","surname":"Kelly","given-name":"Jonathan","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016849"}]}],"source-id":"20100195041","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85080028210"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85080028210?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85080028210&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85080028210&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85080028210","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85080028210","eid":"2-s2.0-85080028210","dc:title":"Engineering Monitoring and Change Detection for Multi-View Stereo 3D Reconstruction Technology","dc:creator":"Chang T.R.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of the Chinese Institute of Civil and Hydraulic Engineering","prism:issn":"10155856","prism:volume":"31","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"337-350","prism:coverDate":"2019-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 June 2019","prism:doi":"10.6652/JoCICHE.201906_31(4).0005","dc:description":"The development of Structure from Motion multi-view stereo 3D reconstruction technology complements the shortcomings of traditional close-range Photogrammetry.

For example, 3D rotations can be represented with quaternions or Euler angles. In this paper, we advance a definition of a continuous representation, which can be helpful for training deep neural networks. We relate this to topological concepts such as homeomorphism and embedding. We then investigate what are continuous and discontinuous representations for 2D, 3D, and n-dimensional rotations. We demonstrate that for 3D rotations, all representations are discontinuous in the real Euclidean spaces of four or fewer dimensions. Thus, widely used representations such as quaternions and Euler angles are discontinuous and difficult for neural networks to learn. We show that the 3D rotations have continuous representations in 5D and 6D, which are more suitable for learning. We also present continuous representations for the general case of the n-dimensional rotation group SO(n). While our main focus is on rotations, we also show that our constructions apply to other groups such as the orthogonal group and similarity transforms. We finally present empirical results, which show that our continuous rotation representations outperform discontinuous ones for several practical problems in graphics and vision, including a simple autoencoder sanity test, a rotation estimator for 3D point clouds, and an inverse kinematics solver for 3D human poses.","citedby-count":"369","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60076047","afid":"60076047","affilname":"Adobe Inc.","affiliation-city":"San Jose","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029311","afid":"60029311","affilname":"University of Southern California","affiliation-city":"Los Angeles","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57200622369","authid":"57200622369","authname":"Zhou Y.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Yi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029311"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23974605400","authid":"23974605400","authname":"Barnes C.","surname":"Barnes","given-name":"Connelly","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60076047"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36022690300","authid":"36022690300","authname":"Lu J.","surname":"Lu","given-name":"Jingwan","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60076047"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55256957800","authid":"55256957800","authname":"Yang J.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Jimei","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60076047"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55082661800","authid":"55082661800","authname":"Li H.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Hao","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029311"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029311"}]}],"authkeywords":"3D from Single Image | And Body Pose | Deep Learning | Face | Gesture | Motion and Tracking | Robotics + Driving","article-number":"8953486","source-id":"24212","fund-acr":"ONR","fund-no":"N00014-17-S-FO14","fund-sponsor":"Office of Naval Research","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073909308"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073909308?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073909308&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073909308&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073909308","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85073909308","eid":"2-s2.0-85073909308","dc:title":"Single and multiple rotation averaging iterative optimization coupled 3D reconstruction for low-altitude images using SfM algorithm","dc:creator":"He H.","prism:publicationName":"Cehui Xuebao/Acta Geodaetica et Cartographica Sinica","prism:issn":"10011595","prism:volume":"48","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"688-697","prism:coverDate":"2019-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2019","prism:doi":"10.11947/j.AGCS.2019.20180063","dc:description":"To reduce the cumulative errors caused by initial stereo model construction and related images augmentation in the existing structure from motion based methods, a single & multiple rotation averaging iterative optimization coupled 3D reconstruction method for low-altitude images is proposed.

Strongly correlated images are found in terms of the optimal incremental decision function, which is constructed based on multiple factors. Secondly, single rotation averaging considering gross erroris used to expand images directed graph in local reference framework, the global uniform optimal solution of rotation and translation matrices can be computed by quaternion supported multiple rotation averaging without involving 3D points.

Firstly, the superpixel segmentation is used to extract multi-scale landmarks and improve the appearance invariance and viewpoint invariance of image description. Then, the convolutional layer of convolutional neural network is extended to the quaternion convolutional layer, which can effectively increase the correlation of red, green and blue channels, extract the deep information of color images, and reflect the integrity of color images. Finally, in image similarity measurement, not only the distance of road sign is calculated, but also the shape and spatial distribution information of landmarks are considered to improve the accuracy of similarity measurement. The effectiveness of the proposed method is experimentally veriﬁed on the public datasets of Carnegie Mellon university and the University of Queensland. Experimental results show that, compared with traditional closed-loop detection algorithm, the proposed algorithm not only guarantees a high recall rate, but also improves the accuracy of closed-loop detection, achieving an average accuracy of 87.64% and 90.12% respectively on the data set, significantly improving the precision of closed-loop detection of mobile robots in complex environments such as such as illumination variations, view variations, and seasonal variations.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023212","afid":"60023212","affilname":"Shenyang University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Shenyang","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192307953","authid":"57192307953","authname":"Zhang X.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023212"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56011532700","authid":"56011532700","authname":"Zhang Y.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Yu","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023212"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402182024","authid":"7402182024","authname":"Su X.","surname":"Su","given-name":"Xiaoming","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023212"}]}],"authkeywords":"Convolutional neural networks | Loop closure detection | Quaternion | Simultaneous localization and mapping | Superpixel segmentation","source-id":"19700186905","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071869925"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071869925?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85071869925&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85071869925&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071869925","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85071869925","eid":"2-s2.0-85071869925","dc:title":"2019 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems, ICUAS 2019","prism:publicationName":"2019 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems, ICUAS 2019","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781728103327"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2019-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2019","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 189 papers.

We propose methods that extract the periodic pattern from the signal in real time and reduce communication between sender and receiver to one sample per cycle period. The proposed methods allow for variable cycle duration and immediately return to full communication if the signal no longer contains the extracted pattern. During reduced communication the receiver provides an immediate real-time signal based on extrapolation and concatenation of the extracted pattern. At the end of each cycle, the receiver additionally reconstructs the signal segment of that cycle by means of time warping, which yields an output that is more accurate but is provided only cyclewise. As a specific example application we consider transmission of quaternion signals from wireless wearable inertial sensors attached to the lower body of a walking human. We quantify how repetitive these signals are and how much they change when the subject simulates pathological gait. We then determine the error between the true signal and the extrapolated and reconstructed signals. The proposed method is found to reduce communication load by up to 80% while remaining sensitive to deviations from the natural variability of human gait.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011604","afid":"60011604","affilname":"Technische Universität Berlin","affiliation-city":"Berlin","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005286","afid":"60005286","affilname":"Rice University","affiliation-city":"Houston","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57210815778","authid":"57210815778","authname":"Zhang T.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Tianyi","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005286"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56444335600","authid":"56444335600","authname":"Laidig D.","surname":"Laidig","given-name":"Daniel","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011604"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55678745300","authid":"55678745300","authname":"Seel T.","surname":"Seel","given-name":"Thomas","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011604"}]}],"article-number":"8796022","source-id":"21100926603","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067662088"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067662088?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85067662088&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85067662088&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067662088","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85067662088","eid":"2-s2.0-85067662088","dc:title":"In-flight correction of the satellite orientation parameter during target mode","dc:creator":"Ali A.A.","prism:publicationName":"Mathematical Modelling of Engineering Problems","prism:issn":"23690739","prism:eIssn":"23690747","prism:volume":"6","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"249-262","prism:coverDate":"2019-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2019","prism:doi":"10.18280/mmep.060213","dc:description":"Spacecraft attitude and orbit control systems have different levels of modes; complex, function, and orientation modes.

The desired orientation parameters related to such modes are calculated for the current time and forecasted for the instant of imaging start according to the flight task arrays. The relative velocity between the on-ground scene pattern and the satellite is calculated and used to determine the required correction of orientation parameters to enhance the image quality and pointing accuracy.

In this method, a novel set of quaternion radial substituted Chebyshev moments (QRSCMs) is presented for robust geometrically invariant image watermarking. An efficient computational method is proposed for highly accurate, fast, and numerically stable QRSCMs in polar coordinates. The proposed watermarking method consists of three stages. In the first stage, the Arnold transform is used to improve the security of the watermarking scheme by scrambling the binary watermark. In the second stage, the proposed accurate and stable QRSCMs of the host color image are computed. In the third stage, the encrypted binary watermark is embedded into the host image by employing the quantization technique on selected-magnitude QRSCMs where the watermarked color image is obtained by adding the original host color image to the compensation image. Then, the binary watermark can be extracted directly without using the original image from the magnitudes of QRSCMs. Numerical experiments are performed where the performance of proposed method is compared with the existing quaternion moment-based watermarking methods. The comparison clearly shows that the proposed method is very efficient in terms of the visual imperceptibility capability and the robustness under different attacks compared to the existing quaternion moment-based watermarking algorithms.","citedby-count":"48","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60274165","afid":"60274165","affilname":"Faculty of Computers and Information","affiliation-city":"Zagazig","affiliation-country":"Egypt"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60273131","afid":"60273131","affilname":"Faculty of Science","affiliation-city":"Asyut","affiliation-country":"Egypt"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205214086","authid":"57205214086","authname":"Hosny K.M.","surname":"Hosny","given-name":"Khalid M.","initials":"K.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60274165"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205229124","authid":"57205229124","authname":"Darwish M.M.","surname":"Darwish","given-name":"Mohamed M.","initials":"M.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60273131"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image watermarking | Geometric attacks | JPEG compression | Noise resistance | Quaternion radial substituted Chebyshev moments","article-number":"a46","source-id":"4700151918","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063594695"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063594695?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85063594695&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85063594695&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1359645419301697"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063594695","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85063594695","eid":"2-s2.0-85063594695","dc:title":"Convolutional neural network-based method for real-time orientation indexing of measured electron backscatter diffraction patterns","dc:creator":"Shen Y.F.","prism:publicationName":"Acta Materialia","prism:issn":"13596454","prism:volume":"170","prism:pageRange":"118-131","prism:coverDate":"2019-05-15","prism:coverDisplayDate":"15 May 2019","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.actamat.2019.03.026","pii":"S1359645419301697","dc:description":"Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) is the most commonly used technique for obtaining spatially resolved microstructural information from polycrystalline materials.

In particular, the observation mission profile requires the CubeSat to quickly reorient itself from its initial attitude to point an imager toward a fixed target area on the Earth's surface. It will then be required to slew in order to maintain a very accurate pointing of the same area for the several seconds required to the image acquisition. We first consider a classical proportional-derivative controller based on the feedback of quaternions, representative of the satellite attitude. Secondly, we implement an innovative optimal guidance based on a direct optimization method, the Inverse Dynamics in the Virtual Domain, and a nonlinear programming solver, the Sequential Gradient-Restoration Algorithm. The key advantage of such optimal guidance is the quick calculation of minimum-time reorientation maneuver.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014826","afid":"60014826","affilname":"South Dakota State University","affiliation-city":"Brookings","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013141","afid":"60013141","affilname":"Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet","affiliation-city":"Trondheim","affiliation-country":"Norway"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211159486","authid":"57211159486","authname":"Lavezzi G.","surname":"Lavezzi","given-name":"Giovanni","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014826"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211156378","authid":"57211156378","authname":"Grottey M.E.","surname":"Grottey","given-name":"Mariusz Eivind","initials":"M.E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013141"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6504804247","authid":"6504804247","authname":"Ciarcia M.","surname":"Ciarcia","given-name":"Marco","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014826"}]}],"authkeywords":"Feedback PD Controller | Inverse Dynamics | Optimal Guidance | Quaternions | Satellite Attitude | Sequential Gradient Restoration Algorithm","article-number":"8833806","source-id":"20300195061","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85072581831"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85072581831?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85072581831&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85072581831&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85072581831","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85072581831","eid":"2-s2.0-85072581831","dc:title":"Quaternion and multiple chaotic systems based pseudo-random number generator","dc:creator":"Li L.","prism:publicationName":"2nd International Conference on Computer Applications and Information Security, ICCAIS 2019","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781728101088"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2019-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May 2019","prism:doi":"10.1109/CAIS.2019.8769495","dc:description":"Quaternions are widely used in physics, geometry and image processing, which are hyper-complex numbers applied in three-dimensional space.

Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive filter in estimating the inverse of a multidimensional acoustic impulse response.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032350","afid":"60032350","affilname":"Sapienza Università di Roma","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36444807900","authid":"36444807900","authname":"Comminiello D.","surname":"Comminiello","given-name":"Danilo","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23490528100","authid":"23490528100","authname":"Scarpiniti M.","surname":"Scarpiniti","given-name":"Michele","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005545586","authid":"7005545586","authname":"Parisi R.","surname":"Parisi","given-name":"Raffaele","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005621339","authid":"7005621339","authname":"Uncini A.","surname":"Uncini","given-name":"Aurelio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]}],"authkeywords":"3D audio | Adaptive signal processing | DSP education. | Frequency-domain adaptive filter | Hypercom-plex signal processing | Quaternion adaptive filtering","article-number":"8683403","source-id":"110544","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068973073"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068973073?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85068973073&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85068973073&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068973073","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85068973073","eid":"2-s2.0-85068973073","dc:title":"Hypercomplex Low Rank Matrix Completion with Non-negative Constraints via Convex Optimization","dc:creator":"Mizoguchi T.","prism:publicationName":"ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - Proceedings","prism:issn":"15206149","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781479981311"}],"prism:volume":"2019-May","prism:pageRange":"8538-8542","prism:coverDate":"2019-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May 2019","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2019.8682476","dc:description":"Expressing multidimensional information as a value in hypercomplex number systems (e.g., quaternion, octonion, etc.) has great potential, in data sciences, e.g., signal processing, to enjoy their nontrivial algebraic benefits which are not available in standard real or complex vector systems. Strategic utilizations of such benefits would include, e.g., hypercomplex singular value decomposition (SVD) and low rank approximation of matrices. In real world applications, e.g., representing color images, of hypercomplex number systems, all attributes are often restricted to be non-negative. In this paper, we formulate non-negative matrix completion problem in hypercomplex domain as a convex optimization problem in real domain. These formulation is based on algebraic translations of Cayley-Dickson (C-D) linear systems. We then derive an algorithmic solution to hypercomplex low rank matrix completion with non-negative constraint based on a proximal splitting technique. Numerical experiments are performed in a scenario of high-dimensional hypercomplex matrix completion problem and show that the proposed algorithm recovers much more faithfully the original information, masked randomly by noise, than a part-wise state-of-art algorithms.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031126","afid":"60031126","affilname":"Tokyo Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tokyo","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55967323300","authid":"55967323300","authname":"Mizoguchi T.","surname":"Mizoguchi","given-name":"Takehiko","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031126"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35486046100","authid":"35486046100","authname":"Yamada I.","surname":"Yamada","given-name":"Isao","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031126"}]}],"authkeywords":"Cayley-Dickson number system | convex optimization | hypercomplex matrix completion | non-negative constraint | proximal splitting","article-number":"8682476","source-id":"110544","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068968569"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068968569?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85068968569&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85068968569&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068968569","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85068968569","eid":"2-s2.0-85068968569","dc:title":"Multichannel Quaternion Least Mean Square Algorithm","dc:creator":"Took C.C.","prism:publicationName":"ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - Proceedings","prism:issn":"15206149","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781479981311"}],"prism:volume":"2019-May","prism:pageRange":"8524-8527","prism:coverDate":"2019-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May 2019","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2019.8682795","dc:description":"Quaternion least-mean-quare (QLMS) algorithm has been thoroughly investigated in the past for the adaptive filtering of 3D and 4D signals.

In this work, the Quaternion Signal Analysis (QSA) method is used to analyze statistical features of motor signals in order to detect faulty and healthy conditions in motor induction. The use of quaternion arithmetic to rotate and characterize signal behavior in a time domain provides accurate results using a reduced number of samples during classification. The accelerometer and current signals measured from the motor are modeled as quaternions. The decision trees method is used to classify healthy (HLT), unbalanced pulley (BAL) and bearing fault (BRN) motor conditions. The proposed methodology was implemented on an FPGA device through Very-High-Speed Hardware Description Language (VHDL) to validate the effectiveness of our method in real motor working conditions. This architecture was tested to validate the effectiveness in real motor working conditions.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033291","afid":"60033291","affilname":"Universidad de Guanajuato","affiliation-city":"Guanajuato","affiliation-country":"Mexico"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57207110899","authid":"57207110899","authname":"Contreras-Hernandez J.","surname":"Contreras-Hernandez","given-name":"Jose L.","initials":"J.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033291"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13608761000","authid":"13608761000","authname":"Almanza-Ojeda D.","surname":"Almanza-Ojeda","given-name":"Dora L.","initials":"D.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033291"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55639546600","authid":"55639546600","authname":"Ledesma S.","surname":"Ledesma","given-name":"Sergio","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033291"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15837259000","authid":"15837259000","authname":"Ibarra-Manzano M.","surname":"Ibarra-Manzano","given-name":"Mario A.","initials":"M.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033291"}]}],"authkeywords":"Fault detection | Feature extraction | FPGA | QSA | Real time processing","source-id":"15424","fund-acr":"CONACYT","fund-no":"487660","fund-sponsor":"Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85060840841"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85060840841?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85060840841&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85060840841&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0020025519300714"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85060840841","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85060840841","eid":"2-s2.0-85060840841","dc:title":"Geometrically invariant color, shape and texture features for object recognition using multiple kernel learning classification approach","dc:creator":"Singh C.","prism:publicationName":"Information Sciences","prism:issn":"00200255","prism:volume":"484","prism:pageRange":"135-152","prism:coverDate":"2019-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May 2019","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.ins.2019.01.058","pii":"S0020025519300714","dc:description":"The geometrically invariant image descriptors are very important for recognizing objects of arbitrary shapes and orientations. We propose a framework for the fusion of the geometrically invariant descriptors representing color, shape, and texture for the recognition of color objects using multiple kernel learning (MKL) approach. To describe texture of color images, we propose an effective rotation invariant texture descriptor which is based on the Zernike moments (ZMs) of the gradient of the color images, referred to as the GZMs. For the shape features, we use the ZMs of the intensity component of a color image and also use multi-channel ZMs (MZMs) which have proven to be superior in performance than the quaternion ZMs (QZMs). For comparative performance analysis, rotation invariants of the QZMs (RQZMs) are also considered. Since the color histograms (CH) are known to be very effective color descriptors, we consider them for representing color. The five sets of features – CH, ZMs, GZMs, MZMs, and RQZMs are invariant to translation, rotation, and scale. The fusion of color, shape and texture features in different combinations using the MKL approach is shown to provide very high recognition rates on PASCAL VOC 2005, Soccer, SIMPLIcity, Flower, and Caltech-101 datasets.","citedby-count":"13","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000690","afid":"60000690","affilname":"Punjabi University","affiliation-city":"Patiala","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56594302700","authid":"56594302700","orcid":"0000-0002-8059-1263","authname":"Singh C.","surname":"Singh","given-name":"Chandan","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000690"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57213875715","authid":"57213875715","authname":"Singh J.","surname":"Singh","given-name":"Jaspreet","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000690"}]}],"authkeywords":"Multi-channel Zernike moments | Multiple kernel learning | Rotation invariant | Texture descriptor","source-id":"15134","fund-acr":"UGC","fund-no":"43-275/2014(SR)","fund-sponsor":"University Grants Commission","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
