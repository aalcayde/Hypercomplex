Though such techniques are suitable for global optimization, they can still be get trapped locally under certain conditions, thus leading to reduced performance. In this work, we propose a quaternionic-based Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA), which extends standard FPA to possibly smoother search spaces based on hypercomplex representations. We show the proposed approach is more accurate than five other metaheuristic techniques in four benchmarking functions. We also present a parallel version of the proposed approach that runs much faster.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014105","afid":"60014105","affilname":"Middlesex University","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013792","afid":"60013792","affilname":"Universidade Federal de São Carlos","affiliation-city":"Sao Carlos","affiliation-country":"Brazil"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006028","afid":"60006028","affilname":"Universidade Estadual Paulista \"Júlio de Mesquita Filho\"","affiliation-city":"Sao Paulo","affiliation-country":"Brazil"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194616052","authid":"57194616052","authname":"Rosa G.H.","surname":"Rosa","given-name":"Gustavo H.","initials":"G.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006028"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36008310900","authid":"36008310900","authname":"Afonso L.C.S.","surname":"Afonso","given-name":"Luis C.S.","initials":"L.C.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013792"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35608798100","authid":"35608798100","authname":"Baldassin A.","surname":"Baldassin","given-name":"Alexandro","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006028"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23397842300","authid":"23397842300","authname":"Papa J.P.","surname":"Papa","given-name":"João P.","initials":"J.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006028"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35754063200","authid":"35754063200","authname":"Yang X.S.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Xin She","initials":"X.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014105"}]}],"authkeywords":"Flower pollination algorithm | Metaheuristics | Quaternions","source-id":"25674","fund-acr":"FAPESP","fund-no":"2014/ 16250-9","fund-sponsor":"Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028453137"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028453137?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85028453137&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85028453137&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028453137","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85028453137","eid":"2-s2.0-85028453137","dc:title":"17th International Conference on Computer Analysis of Images and Patterns, CAIP 2017","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783319646978"}],"prism:volume":"10425 LNCS","prism:pageRange":"1-484","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 72 papers.

The quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) is one of the effective multi-scale decomposition tools. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel multimodal image fusion method using QWT and multiple features. First, we perform QWT on each source image to obtain low-frequency coefficients and high-frequency coefficients. Second, a weighted average fusion rule based on the phase and magnitude of low-frequency subband and spatial variance is proposed to fuse the low-frequency subbands. Next, a choose-max fusion rule based on the contrast and energy of coefficient is proposed to integrate the high-frequency subbands. Finally, the final fused image is constructed by inverse QWT. The proposed method is conducted on multi-focus images, medical images, infrared-visible images, and remote sensing images, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","citedby-count":"75","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073673","afid":"60073673","affilname":"Suzhou University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Suzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007029","afid":"60007029","affilname":"Jiangnan University","affiliation-city":"Wuxi","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195467535","authid":"57195467535","authname":"Chai P.","surname":"Chai","given-name":"Pengfei","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007029"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23985472800","authid":"23985472800","orcid":"0000-0001-8030-1660","authname":"Luo X.","surname":"Luo","given-name":"Xiaoqing","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007029"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219233537","authid":"57219233537","authname":"Zhang Z.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Zhancheng","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073673"}]}],"authkeywords":"feature | Image fusion | magnitude | phase | quaternion wavelet transform","article-number":"7884973","source-id":"21100374601","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"6141A02033312","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027720299"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027720299?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85027720299&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85027720299&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027720299","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85027720299","eid":"2-s2.0-85027720299","dc:title":"Color two-dimensional principal component analysis for face recognition based on quaternion model","dc:creator":"Jia Z.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783319633084"}],"prism:volume":"10361 LNCS","prism:pageRange":"177-189","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-63309-1_17","dc:description":"The color two-dimensional principal component analysis (color 2DPCA) approach based on quaternion model is presented for color face recognition.

The controller designed guarantees the robustness properties with respect to parametric uncertainties and other disturbances. The system state remains in the neighborhood of a reference attitude and the control signal is close to a well-defined equivalent control. The amplitude of the sliding mode controller is tuned using an evolutionary optimization technique, i.e., Genetic algorithm. Multi-objective optimizer is used for the controller as it is to minimize the error in the Bank Angle (degree), Angle of Attack (degree), and Sideslip Angle (degree). The reference attitude is obtained in terms of the outputs given by the trajectory controller and the navigational system. A pulse width pulse frequency (PWPF) modulator is designed to modulate the attitude controller through the thrust torque developed. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014273","afid":"60014273","affilname":"B.S.Abdur Rahman University","affiliation-city":"Chennai","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194451028","authid":"57194451028","authname":"Vijay D.","surname":"Vijay","given-name":"Divya","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014273"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195322823","authid":"57195322823","authname":"Bhanu U.S.","surname":"Bhanu","given-name":"U.

The current paper introduces a novel method for encrypting/decrypting audio signal using a selected digital image as a complicated key and cover for audio signal. Each sample of the audio signal is combined with the values of the three color components of a pixel fetched from the cover image yielding a quaternion number. The absolute value of this quaternion number is then transmitted and when received, the original value of the audio sample can be extracted using simple quaternion mathematics. A second level of complexity can be added to this approach by applying one of the well-known cryptographic techniques (symmetric or asymmetric). The suggested approach is implemented using Matlab simulation software and the generated audio signal is compared with the original one using some performance metrics. The obtained results show that the proposed approach is robust and more secure against cryptanalysis attacks without affecting the used bandwidth of the communication channel.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60105146","afid":"60105146","affilname":"Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University","affiliation-city":"Riyadh","affiliation-country":"Saudi Arabia"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195264555","authid":"57195264555","authname":"Khalil M.I.","surname":"Khalil","given-name":"M.

In terms of the orientation estimation based on the use of a Kalman filter (KF), the quaternion is arguably the most popular orientation representation. However, one critical drawback in the quaternion representation is that undesirable magnetic disturbances affect not only yaw estimation but also roll and pitch estimations. In this paper, a sequential direction cosine matrix-based orientation KF for AHRS has been presented. The proposed algorithm uses two linear KFs, consisting of an attitude KF followed by a heading KF. In the latter, the direction of the local magnetic field vector is projected onto the heading axis of the inertial frame by considering the dip angle, which can be determined after the attitude KF. Owing to the sequential KF structure, the effects of even extreme magnetic disturbances are limited to the roll and pitch estimations, without any additional decoupling process. This overcomes an inherent issue in quaternion-based estimation algorithms. Validation test results show that the proposed method outperforms other comparison methods in terms of the yaw estimation accuracy during perturbations and in terms of the recovery speed.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073748","afid":"60073748","affilname":"Hankyong National University","affiliation-city":"Anseong","affiliation-country":"South Korea"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57032175000","authid":"57032175000","authname":"Lee J.K.","surname":"Lee","given-name":"Jung Keun","initials":"J.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073748"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073748"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194572737","authid":"57194572737","authname":"Choi M.J.","surname":"Choi","given-name":"Mi Jin","initials":"M.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073748"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) | Direction cosine matrix (DCM) | Magnetic disturbance | Orientation | Sequential Kalman filter","source-id":"17200154707","fund-acr":"MSIP","fund-no":"NRF-2015R1C1A1A02036373","fund-sponsor":"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85020463222"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85020463222?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85020463222&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85020463222&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85020463222","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85020463222","eid":"2-s2.0-85020463222","dc:title":"A novel scheme on multi-channel mechanical fault signal diagnosis based on augmented quaternion singular spectrum analysis","dc:creator":"Lv Y.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Vibroengineering","prism:issn":"13928716","prism:volume":"19","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"955-966","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","prism:doi":"10.21595/jve.2016.17239","dc:description":"In this paper, a novel multi-channel mechanical failure signal classification method based on augmented quaternion singular spectrum analysis (AQSSA) is proposed. Quaternion is used to couple four channels signal, and the quaternion trajectory matrixes can be developed as augmented quaternion matrix by using the feature of the quaternion. The singular value sequence including characteristic information can be extracted by quaternion singular value decomposition (QSVD) of the augmented trajectory matrix using its covariance matrix. The method of traditional singular spectrum analysis (SSA) can only analyze the single channel signal, however, AQSSA can fully use the correlation of multi-channel and reduce the loss of the effective information. Additionally, the main singular values are defined by some methods such as difference spectrum aimed, which has the limitation that major singular values can’t be obtained under the high background noise. Thus, a concept of partial mean of singular value sequence is proposed, and it can be set as the standard of evaluating the trend of singular value sequence. In order to testify the performance of the proposed method, the numerical simulation signal and the fault vibration signal of bearing are simultaneously adopted to verify its effectiveness. The results indicate that the effectiveness of mechanical fault classification by the proposed method is superior to the traditional SSA method and the method of permutation entropy.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014643","afid":"60014643","affilname":"Wuhan University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36989875000","authid":"36989875000","authname":"Lv Y.","surname":"Lv","given-name":"Yong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014643"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194500931","authid":"57194500931","authname":"He B.","surname":"He","given-name":"Bo","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014643"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190026628","authid":"57190026628","authname":"Yi C.","surname":"Yi","given-name":"Cancan","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014643"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190028659","authid":"57190028659","authname":"Dang Z.","surname":"Dang","given-name":"Zhang","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014643"}]}],"authkeywords":"Fault classification | Multi-channel signal processing | Partial mean | Quaternion | Singular spectrum analysis","source-id":"12200154705","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"51105284","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85020411759"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85020411759?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85020411759&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85020411759&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85020411759","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85020411759","eid":"2-s2.0-85020411759","dc:title":"Averaging three-dimensional time-varying sequences of rotations: Application to preprocessing of motion capture data","dc:creator":"Hachaj T.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783319591254"}],"prism:volume":"10269 LNCS","prism:pageRange":"17-28","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-59126-1_2","dc:description":"The aim of this paper is to propose and initially evaluate our novel algorithm which enables averaging of time-varying sequences of rotations with three degrees of freedom described by quaternions. The methodology is based on Dynamic Time Warping barycenter averaging (DBA) with one minus dot product distance function, Markley’s quaternions averaging method and Gaussian quaternion signal smoothing. The proposed algorithm was successfully applied to generate single, averaged motion capture recording (MoCap) from ten MoCap of mawashi-geri karate kick of black belt Shorin-Ryu karate master. We have used inverse kinematic model. In our experiment mean DTW normalized distance between averaged signal and original signals varied from 0.713 · 10−3 for Hips sensor to 6.153 · 10−3 for LeftForearm sensor, which were very good results. Also the visualization of the averaged MoCap data showed that the proposed method did not introduce unwanted disturbances and may be usable for that task. That type of averaging has many important applications. For example it can be used to calculate and visualize an average performance of an athlete who performs some activity that he wants to optimize during training.

The quaternion numbers are four dimensional hyper-complex numbers. Quaternion representation of color image allows us to see the color of the image as a single unit. In quaternion approach of color image enhancement, each color is seen as a vector. This permits us to see the merging effect of the color due to the combination of the primary colors. The color images are used to be processed by applying the respective algorithm onto each channels separately, and then, composing the color image from the processed channels. In this article, the alpha-rooting and zonal alpha-rooting methods are used with the 2-D QDFT. In the alpha-rooting method, the alpha-root of the transformed frequency values of the 2-D QDFT are determined before taking the inverse transform. In the zonal alpha-rooting method, the frequency spectrum of the 2-D QDFT is divided by different zones and the alpha-rooting is applied with different alpha values for different zones. The optimization of the choice of alpha values is done with the genetic algorithm. The visual perception of 3-D medical images is increased by changing the reference gray line.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003212","afid":"60003212","affilname":"The University of Texas at San Antonio","affiliation-city":"San Antonio","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006123399","authid":"7006123399","authname":"Grigoryan A.","surname":"Grigoryan","given-name":"Artyom M.","initials":"A.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003212"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194467413","authid":"57194467413","authname":"John A.","surname":"John","given-name":"Aparna","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003212"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003395533","authid":"7003395533","authname":"Agaian S.","surname":"Agaian","given-name":"Sos S.","initials":"S.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003212"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color images | Image enhancement | Medical images | Quaternion discrete Fourier transform","article-number":"1013618","source-id":"130022","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85019723453"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85019723453?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85019723453&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85019723453&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85019723453","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85019723453","eid":"2-s2.0-85019723453","dc:title":"Lie algebra-valued bidirectional associative memories","dc:creator":"Popa C.","prism:publicationName":"Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing","prism:issn":"21945357","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783319580876"}],"prism:volume":"576","prism:pageRange":"127-135","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-58088-3_12","dc:description":"In recent years, complex-, quaternion-, and Clifford-valued neural networks have been intensively studied.

Loss is measured in a single, planar coil consisting of concentric circular loops while the coil is relocated to various non-redundant positions and orientations in the vicinity of the target. These loss values, together with measured coil position and orientation, are processed by a quantitative mapping equation that enables reconstruction of an electrical conductivity image. Up until now, the position of the coil had to be established by a template, which required assignment of locations for the coil to visit without necessarily giving any prior consideration to target geometry. We have now added optical tracking to our existing single-coil device so that position and orientation are tracked automatically, allowing collection of coil loss data at arbitrary positions or orientations as needed. Optical tracking is accomplished via a set of IR reflective spheres mounted on the same enclosure that supports the coil. Position for a select sphere within the set, together with the four quaternions specifying optical body orientation, is fed to a laptop at the same time coil loss data is streamed to the same laptop via Bluetooth. The coil center can be tracked with sub-millimeter accuracy while orientation angle is known to a fraction of a degree. This work illustrates the use of single-coil MIT in full, position-orientation-tracked scan mode while imaging laboratory phantoms. Phantoms are based upon simple materials having biologic conductivity (< 5 S/m), including a cut of bone-in steak. The goal is not just to reconstruct an image that contains the features of the actual target, but also return correct conductivity values for the various features within the image.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007318","afid":"60007318","affilname":"Kimberly-Clark","affiliation-city":"Irving","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190282254","authid":"57190282254","authname":"Feldkamp J.R.","surname":"Feldkamp","given-name":"Joe R.","initials":"J.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007318"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35365125100","authid":"35365125100","authname":"Quirk S.","surname":"Quirk","given-name":"Stephen","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007318"}]}],"authkeywords":"Magnetic Induction | Optical | Orientation | Position Tracking | Single Coil | Tomography","article-number":"101324P","source-id":"130022","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85018283264"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85018283264?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85018283264&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85018283264&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85018283264","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85018283264","eid":"2-s2.0-85018283264","dc:title":"Automatic target recognition in SAR images using quaternion wavelet transform and principal component analysis","dc:creator":"Arivazhagan S.","prism:publicationName":"International Journal of Computational Vision and Robotics","prism:issn":"17529131","prism:eIssn":"1752914X","prism:volume":"7","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"314-334","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","prism:doi":"10.1504/IJCVR.2017.083449","dc:description":"Automatic target recognition (ATR) is the task of classifying sensed imagery from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatically into a canonical set of target classes.

To identify the certain region of SAR images, patches are extracted over the interest points detected from the SAR images. Then QWT features and PCA features are computed and combined for every patch. These extracted features are trained and classified using SVM. The performance of QWT is compared with two more multiresolution transforms such as ridgelet transform and log Gabor transform as well as the Scale and rotationinvariant interest point detector and descriptor, named speeded up robust features (SURF).

The purpose of our study is to lay geometric foundations for statistical analysis of SPD matrices, in situations in which eigenstructure is of fundamental importance, for example diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI). Eigen-decomposition, upon which the scaling-rotation framework is based, determines both a stratification of Sym+(p), defined by eigenvalue multiplicities, and fibers of the \"eigencomposition\" map SO(p)×Diag+(p) → Sym+(p). This leads to the notion of scaling-rotation distance [Jung et al. (2015)], a measure of the minimal amount of scaling and rotation needed to transform an SPD matrix, X, into another, Y, by a smooth curve in Sym+(p). Our main goal in this paper is the systematic characterization and analysis of minimal smooth scalingrotation (MSSR) curves, images in Sym+(p) of minimal-length geodesics connecting two fibers in the \"upstairs\" space SO(p)×Diag+(p). The length of such a geodesic connecting the fibers over X and Y is what we define to be the scaling-rotation distance from X to Y. For the important lowdimensional case p = 3 (the home of DTI), we find new explicit formulas for MSSR curves and for the scaling-rotation distance, and identify the set M(X, Y) of MSSR curves from X to Y in all \"nontrivial\" cases. The quaternionic representation of SO(3) is used in these computations. We also provide closed-form expressions for scaling-rotation distance and MSSR curves for the case p = 2.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030612","afid":"60030612","affilname":"University of California, San Diego","affiliation-city":"San Diego","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015543","afid":"60015543","affilname":"University of Pittsburgh","affiliation-city":"Pittsburgh","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013959","afid":"60013959","affilname":"University of Florida","affiliation-city":"Gainesville","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602768601","authid":"6602768601","authname":"Groisser D.","surname":"Groisser","given-name":"David","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013959"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35299524400","authid":"35299524400","authname":"Jung S.","surname":"Jung","given-name":"Sungkyu","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015543"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8903084800","authid":"8903084800","authname":"Schwartzman A.","surname":"Schwartzman","given-name":"Armin","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030612"}]}],"authkeywords":"Eigen-decomposition | Geodesics | Scaling-rotation distance | Statistics on manifolds | Stratified spaces | Symmetric group","source-id":"19900192726","fund-acr":"NSF","fund-no":"1307178","fund-sponsor":"National Science Foundation","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85016518453"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85016518453?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85016518453&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85016518453&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85016518453","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85016518453","eid":"2-s2.0-85016518453","dc:title":"Color printing image quality evaluation method based on full quaternion matrix","dc:creator":"Zhong Y.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering","prism:issn":"18761100","prism:eIssn":"18761119","prism:volume":"417","prism:pageRange":"205-212","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-981-10-3530-2_26","dc:description":"This paper proposed a color printing image quality evaluation method on the basis of the full quaternion matrix. First of all, according to the properties of the quaternion matrix and the characteristics of the color image, color image luminance component of local variance are used as a real part of quaternion and built color printing images of the quaternion representation model. Then to singular value decomposition of quaternion, calculate the quaternion matrix corresponding to the block of singular value feature vector, take the maximum value as the main parameter of measuring structural similarity images. Color printing image quality evaluation is realized by comparing a maximum of two images’ singular value feature vector. The experimental results show that the full quaternion method is used to express the structure of the color image information which highlight the human eye visual structure of sensitive information in the image quality assessment as well as realizes the RGB color image information in three-channel parallel processing, enhances and improves the efficiency and accuracy of color printing image quality assessment.

Design/methodology/approach - In the stability mode, linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control strategies are presented with the gimbal rates as a controller parameters. Instead of developing a control torque to solve the attitude problem, the attitude controller is developed in terms of the control moment gyroscope gimbal angular velocities. Attitude control torques are generated by means of a four SGCMG pyramid cluster. Findings - Numerical simulation results are provided to show the efficiency of the proposed controllers. Simulation results show that this method could stabilize satellite from initial condition with large angles and with more accuracy in comparison with feedback quaternion and proportional-integral-derivative controllers. These results show the effect of filtering the noisy signal in the LQG controller. LQG in comparison to LQR is more realistic. Practical implications - The LQR method is more appropriate for the systems that have project models reasonably exact and ideal sensors/ actuators. LQG is more realistic, and it can be used when not all of the states are available or when the system presents noises. LQR/LQG controller can be used in the stabilization mode of satellite attitude control. Originality/value - The originality of this paper is designing a new attitude stabilization system for an agile microsatellite using LQR and LQG controllers.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016248","afid":"60016248","affilname":"K.

In this paper a family of discrete color–valued and multicolor–valued 2–D Fourier–like, wavelet– like transforms and splines has been presented (in the context of hypercomplex analysis). These transforms can be used in color, multicolor, and hyperspectral image processing. In our approach, each multichannel pixel is considered not as an K–D vector, but as an K–D hypercomplex number, where K is the number of different optical channels. Orthounitary transforms and splines are specific combination (Centaurus) of orthogonal and unitary transforms. We present several examples of possible Centuaruses (ortho–unitary transforms): Fourier+Walsh, ComplexWalsh+OrdinaryWalsh and so on.We collect basis functions of these transforms in the form of iconostas. These transforms are applicable to multichannel images with several components and are different from the classical Fourier transform in that they mix the channel components of the image. New multichannel transforms and splines generalize real– valued and complex–valued ones. They can be used for multichannel images compression, interpolation and edge detection from the point of view of hypercomplex commutative algebras. The main goal of the work is to show that hypercomplex algebras can be used to solve problems of multichannel (color, multicolor, and hyperspectral) image processing in a natural and effective manner.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60103702","afid":"60103702","affilname":"Ural Federal University","affiliation-city":"Yekaterinburg","affiliation-country":"Russian Federation"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114798627","afid":"114798627","affilname":"Capricat LLC","affiliation-city":"Pompano Beach","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56440079800","authid":"56440079800","authname":"Ostheimer E.","surname":"Ostheimer","given-name":"Ekaterina","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"114798627"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701610877","authid":"6701610877","authname":"Labunets V.","surname":"Labunets","given-name":"Valery","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60103702"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57022242500","authid":"57022242500","authname":"Artemov I.","surname":"Artemov","given-name":"Ivan","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60103702"}]}],"authkeywords":"Image processing | Multichannel image | Ortho–unitary transforms | Splines | Wavelets","source-id":"17700155007","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85009511221"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85009511221?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85009511221&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85009511221&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85009511221","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85009511221","eid":"2-s2.0-85009511221","dc:title":"Quaternion circularly semi-orthogonal moments for invariant image recognition","dc:creator":"Ananth Raj P.","prism:publicationName":"Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing","prism:issn":"21945357","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789811021060"}],"prism:volume":"460 AISC","prism:pageRange":"509-522","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-981-10-2107-7_46","dc:description":"We propose a new Quaternion Circularly Semi-Orthogonal Moments for color images that are invariant to rotation, translation and scale changes.

The algorithm is suitable for the real-time optical measurement.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025441","afid":"60025441","affilname":"Nanjing Tech University","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/117878420","afid":"117878420","affilname":"Nanjing Kangni Mechanical and Electrical Company Limited","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192653099","authid":"57192653099","authname":"Miao X.","surname":"Miao","given-name":"Xiaodong","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"117878420"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025441"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192653517","authid":"57192653517","authname":"Shi X.","surname":"Shi","given-name":"Xiang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"117878420"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203102440","authid":"57203102440","authname":"Xu Z.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Zhixing","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"117878420"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192656603","authid":"57192656603","authname":"Wang A.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Aiqing","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"117878420"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192651672","authid":"57192651672","authname":"Wang W.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"117878420"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025441"}]}],"authkeywords":"Image processing | Laser spot | Quaternion discrete cosine Transform","source-id":"5100152904","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84998785521"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84998785521?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84998785521&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84998785521&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84998785521","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84998785521","eid":"2-s2.0-84998785521","dc:title":"Research on the principle of six degree-of-freedom laser tracker metrology","dc:creator":"Yu L.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering","prism:issn":"18761100","prism:eIssn":"18761119","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789811028748"}],"prism:volume":"408","prism:pageRange":"1541-1555","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-981-10-2875-5_122","dc:description":"Due to the demand for precise positioning and high precision trajectory of robots end-effector, laser tracker measurement functions in position and gesture of a target are studied respectively. For the position measurement of the target, laser interference (IF) measurement method based on phase difference and absolute distance (AD) measurement method based on dual frequency modulation signal are analyzed. In order to ensure position measurement accuracy, switch condition for two measuring methods and operation mode are introduced, and the measurement accuracy up to 6 lm/m. For the gesture measurement of the target, the measurement principle of the monocular camera is analyzed. Based on four non-coplanar feature points of measuring auxiliary instruments(such as Leica T-Mac) mounted on the target, the monocular camera imaging model is simplified as the pinhole imaging model, and combined with the quaternions transformation form of the rotation matrix, measurement system’s single direction angle accuracy is up to 0.60″. This paper constructs based on the position and gesture measurement system of the robot end-effector with laser tracker, setting the robot end-effector according to the predetermined linear trajectory, to move with different velocities. And the laser tracker is used to measure the position and gesture of the robot end-effector trajectory discrete points and the robot end-effector’s position error and gesture error are analyzed to check the robot end-effector positioning accuracy. The laser tracker is the measurement device of the position and gesture of the robot end-effector, which can lay the foundation for robot calibration.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032504","afid":"60032504","affilname":"Shanghai University of Engineering Science","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192162931","authid":"57192162931","authname":"Yu L.","surname":"Yu","given-name":"Liang","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032504"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005104733","authid":"7005104733","authname":"Hang L.","surname":"Hang","given-name":"Lubin","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032504"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8510870300","authid":"8510870300","authname":"Cheng W.","surname":"Cheng","given-name":"Wushan","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032504"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57170127800","authid":"57170127800","authname":"Huangfu Y.","surname":"Huangfu","given-name":"Yabo","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032504"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192158798","authid":"57192158798","authname":"Li W.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Wentao","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032504"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192158427","authid":"57192158427","authname":"Yang G.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Guobin","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032504"}]}],"authkeywords":"Dual frequency modulation | Laser measurement | Monocular vision | Phase difference interferometry","source-id":"19700186822","fund-no":"12510501100","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
