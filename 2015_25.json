This letter proposes a novel way to design quaternion-valued kernels, this is achieved by transforming three complex kernels into quaternion ones and then combining their real and imaginary parts.

Moreover, this allows it to be shown that the scalar quaternionic linear model is equivalent to constrained matrix-based color filtering, which highlights the filtering implicitly applied through this model. Based on this reformulation, the new color filtering model is introduced, using unconstrained filters. In this model, spatial morphologies of color images are encoded by atoms, and colors are encoded by color filters.

The quaternion discrete Fourier transform (QDFT), a generalization of the Fourier transform, represents the three color channels of an image in the RGB color space as a vector field in the quaternion arithmetic allowing for simultaneous analysis of all color data. It is expected that this new color imaging model which captures the interactions between the different color channels will improve upon existing image processing and recognition systems. Efficient QDFT algorithms are derived by combining classical DFT transforms, enabling standard fast Fourier transform (FFT) software to provide a fast QDFT numerical implementation. We developed an open-source quaternion Fourier transform tool that calculates the 2-D QDFT by the column-row method which is performed by calculating multiple 1-D QDFTs where each 1-D transform is calculated by two complex 1-D DFTs. The matrices involved in these calculations necessitate the inclusion of a discussion on symplectic decomposition. Our main contribution is the presentation a new algorithm for the tensor representation of the QDFT that is structurally simpler and uses less multiplications than its predecessors. For instance, for the images of size N×N, where N=2r,r>2, the tensor 2-D QDFT saves about 2N2r real multiplications.","citedby-count":"19","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003212","afid":"60003212","affilname":"The University of Texas at San Antonio","affiliation-city":"San Antonio","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006123399","authid":"7006123399","authname":"Grigoryan A.M.","surname":"Grigoryan","given-name":"Artyom M.","initials":"A.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003212"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003395533","authid":"7003395533","authname":"Agaian S.S.","surname":"Agaian","given-name":"Sos S.","initials":"S.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003212"}]}],"authkeywords":"Fast Fourier transform | Fast quaternion Fourier transform | Image color analysis | Image enhancement | Tensor representation","source-id":"15134","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84954109631"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84954109631?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84954109631&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84954109631&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84954109631","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84954109631","eid":"2-s2.0-84954109631","dc:title":"Event-Triggered attitude control for flying robots using an event approach based on the control","dc:creator":"Guerrero-Castellanos J.F.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of 1st International Conference on Event-Based Control, Communication and Signal Processing, EBCCSP 2015","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781467378888"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2015-10-19","prism:coverDisplayDate":"19 October 2015","prism:doi":"10.1109/EBCCSP.2015.7300675","dc:description":"This paper presents the development of a quaternion-based nonlinear event-Triggered control for the attitude stabilization of Flying robots.

Based on this idea, this paper proposes an online robot auto-calibration method with some developments. In order to eliminate the noise and measurement error of the IMU, a Factored Quaternion Algorithm (FQA) and a Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) algorithm are integrated in use to estimate the orientation of the robot EE. With the estimated orientation, the kinematic parameter errors could be obtained by the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Compared to the existing robot calibration methods, this method does not require complex procedures, for example the image capture and process, which makes it more intelligent and efficient. With this method in robot production and maintenance, the reliability and accuracy of the manipulator orientation will increase.

The benefit of the Quat-KLMS and widely linear forms in learning nonlinear transformations of quaternion data are illustrated with simulations.","citedby-count":"35","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010451","afid":"60010451","affilname":"Santa Clara University","affiliation-city":"Santa Clara","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26435566700","authid":"26435566700","authname":"Paul T.","surname":"Paul","given-name":"Thomas K.","initials":"T.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010451"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004919562","authid":"7004919562","authname":"Ogunfunmi T.","surname":"Ogunfunmi","given-name":"Tokunbo","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010451"}]}],"authkeywords":"Gaussian kernel | kernel least mean square (KLMS) | kernel methods | mean-square error (MSE) | quaternions | widely linear estimation","article-number":"7006723","source-id":"21100235616","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84950316151"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84950316151?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84950316151&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84950316151&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84950316151","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84950316151","eid":"2-s2.0-84950316151","dc:title":"Particle filtering algorithm for DOA tracking with acoustic vector sensor array","dc:creator":"Li X.B.","prism:publicationName":"Guangxue Jingmi Gongcheng/Optics and Precision Engineering","prism:issn":"1004924X","prism:volume":"23","prism:pageRange":"606-613","prism:coverDate":"2015-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2015","prism:doi":"10.3788/OPE.20152313.0606","dc:description":"According to the shortcomings of Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation methods and subspace updating algorithm, this paper proposes a particle filtering algorithm combined with the DOA estimation algorithm for DOA tracking with an acoustic vector sensor array. First, the observation model based on the acoustic vector sensor array was set up, and the state equation was deduced on the basis of the second-order model of uniform velocity. Then, the quaternion Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm was used to improve the observed likelihood function of the particle filtering algorithm and a improved tracking algorithm was proposed. Finally, the performance of each algorithm was simulated. Experimental results show that the mentioned algorithm achieves DOA real-time tracking. As compared with the subspace tracking algorithm and particle filtering algorithm, the tracking error of the proposed algorithm is smaller. When a Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) is less than-10 dB, the tracking errors of tracking algorithms based on the particle filtering algorithm are within 4°, thus they can adapt to a lower SNR environment.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007711","afid":"60007711","affilname":"Jilin University","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35770876900","authid":"35770876900","authname":"Li X.B.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Xin Bo","initials":"X.B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56920986400","authid":"56920986400","authname":"Jiang L.X.","surname":"Jiang","given-name":"Liang Xu","initials":"L.X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56510414200","authid":"56510414200","authname":"Liu G.J.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Guo Jun","initials":"G.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57008558600","authid":"57008558600","authname":"Wang H.J.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Hao Jie","initials":"H.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404964763","authid":"7404964763","authname":"Shi Y.W.","surname":"Shi","given-name":"Yao Wu","initials":"Y.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57044906100","authid":"57044906100","authname":"Yang Z.G.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Zhi Gang","initials":"Z.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55887981600","authid":"55887981600","authname":"Liu J.F.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Jian Fang","initials":"J.F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]}],"authkeywords":"Acoustic vector sensor | Direction of Arrival (DOA) tracking | Particle filter | Quaternion MUSIC | State space model","source-id":"144897","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84949986560"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84949986560?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84949986560&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84949986560&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84949986560","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84949986560","eid":"2-s2.0-84949986560","dc:title":"Accuracy analysis on bundle adjustment of remote sensing images based on dual quaternion","dc:creator":"Sheng Q.","prism:publicationName":"Transactions of Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics","prism:issn":"10051120","prism:volume":"32","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"523-529","prism:coverDate":"2015-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2015","dc:description":"A bundle adjustment method of remote sensing images based on dual quaternion is presented, which conducted the uniform disposal corresponding location and attitude of sequence images by the dual quaternion.

The unit quaternion solution is employed for initial registration. After the initial registration of point clouds, this cannot meet the requirements of registration accuracy. Therefore, we need to achieve accurate registration on the basis of initial registration. The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is one of the widely-used methods to cope with 3D registration.

Firstly, the specific method of attitude adjustment for nonparallel-ground-track imaging mode is studied to get the desired attitude angle and angular velocity. Secondly, according to the tracking dynamic and kinematic model described by quaternion error, a nonsingular and fast terminal sliding mode (NFTSM) controller is derived. In order to enhance control accuracy, a CNN that is implemented using only desired signals is introduced to approximate the general disturbance which efficiently weakens the chattering inherent in sliding mode structure. In order to guarantee that the output of the NN used in the controller is bounded by the corresponding bound of the approximated disturbance, a switch function is applied to generating a switching between the adaptive neural network (ANN) control and the robust controller. Finally, numerical simulations on the attitude tracking control of spacecraft in the presence of environmental disturbance and parameters' uncertainties are performed, the results of which show that the designed control scheme has fast convergence, high control accuracy and certain actual engineering significance.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073440","afid":"60073440","affilname":"Beijing Institute of Control Engineering","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57215232481","authid":"57215232481","authname":"Ye D.","surname":"Ye","given-name":"Dong","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56941302100","authid":"56941302100","authname":"Tu Y.","surname":"Tu","given-name":"Yuanyuan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073440"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404240577","authid":"7404240577","authname":"Sun Z.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Zhaowei","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude tracking | Chebyshev neural network (CNN) | Lyapunov method | Remote sensing | Sliding mode control","source-id":"29006","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84957615925"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84957615925?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84957615925&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84957615925&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84957615925","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84957615925","eid":"2-s2.0-84957615925","dc:title":"Stereo SLAM for robust dense 3D reconstruction of underwater environments","dc:creator":"Bonin-Font F.","prism:publicationName":"MTS/IEEE OCEANS 2015 - Genova: Discovering Sustainable Ocean Energy for a New World","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781479987368"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2015-09-17","prism:coverDisplayDate":"17 September 2015","prism:doi":"10.1109/OCEANS-Genova.2015.7271333","dc:description":"The virtual reconstruction of underwater environments in 3 dimensions can be of great utility for scientific or industrials applications, being the use of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) equipped with cameras an invaluable tool with progressive improvements. However, a highly accurate vehicle localization process is fundamental to place every portion of that 3D model in its real position with respect to the origin of the world system of coordinates, and to join properly the overall reconstructed area, especially in large surveys. Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) techniques constitute the most precise localization approach using only data provided by the navigation sensors installed on board the underwater robot. However, the real challenge consists in applying these techniques in underwater environments where the imaging conditions are usually limited or degraded. This paper presents the comparison of two different SLAM approaches based on stereo-vision, a graph-SLAM and an EKF SLAM, applied to localize, in real time, an AUV moving in underwater environments. Both algorithms deal with pure 3D data, (x, y, z) for the vehicle position and a quaternion to represent its orientation. The aim of this work is to assess and compare the performance of both solutions in terms of accuracy in the estimation of the robot pose. First experiments were conducted in controlled aquatic scenarios where it was feasible to build a highly reliable ground truth, showing how the graph-SLAM approach outperforms its EKF counterpart under the same working and environmental conditions. A second set of experiments was conducted in the sea, showing the same tendency in the results. The SLAM pose estimates, given with respect to a global world frame, corresponding to the approach with less accumulated error are used to recreated virtual 3D maps of the environment based on the concatenation of successive stereo visual point clouds placed in the corresponding SLAM locations.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60068815","afid":"60068815","affilname":"University of Belgrade","affiliation-city":"Belgrade","affiliation-country":"Serbia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009780","afid":"60009780","affilname":"Universitat de les Illes Balears","affiliation-city":"Palma","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006429","afid":"60006429","affilname":"Universität Koblenz-Landau","affiliation-city":"Koblenz am Rhein","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24079942800","authid":"24079942800","authname":"Bonin-Font F.","surname":"Bonin-Font","given-name":"Francisco","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009780"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/53865997500","authid":"53865997500","authname":"Cosic A.","surname":"Cosic","given-name":"Aleksandar","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60068815"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57105385900","authid":"57105385900","authname":"Negre P.","surname":"Negre","given-name":"Pep Lluis","initials":"P.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009780"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57105420400","authid":"57105420400","authname":"Solbach M.","surname":"Solbach","given-name":"Markus","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006429"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202065303","authid":"7202065303","authname":"Oliver G.","surname":"Oliver","given-name":"Gabriel","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009780"}]}],"article-number":"7271333","source-id":"21100444318","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84940396136"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84940396136?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84940396136&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84940396136&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84940396136","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84940396136","eid":"2-s2.0-84940396136","dc:title":"Semi-Widely Simulation and Estimation of Continuous-Time cn Proper Quaternion Random Signals","dc:creator":"Navarro-Moreno J.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","prism:issn":"1053587X","prism:volume":"63","prism:issueIdentifier":"18","prism:pageRange":"4999-5012","prism:coverDate":"2015-09-15","prism:coverDisplayDate":"15 September 2015","prism:doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2448521","dc:description":"The repercussions of quaternion BBCeta-properness on the continuous-time simulation and estimation problems are studied.

The estimation problem is also analyzed in a continuous-discrete setting and by considering two different formulations: the Cambanis formulation and the signal plus noise model. Initially, the estimators are developed on the basis of a semi-widely linear processing. Afterwards, the solutions are improved by incorporating the information supplied by the square quaternion observations and by using a semi-widely nonlinear processing.

Then, the control law is redesigned such that the actuator-magnitude constraint is explicitly taken into account, and the associated stability proof is accomplished by the development of a novel Lyapunov function candidate containing integral terms involving the various states. The proposed controller achieves asymptotic stabilization with saturated inputs and is robust to parametric uncertainty in the spacecraft inertia matrix.

While it has been applied on the field of face and expression recognition [1], [2], [3], there are no known usages for subtle facial micro-expressions. In this paper, we propose a feature representation method which succinctly captures these three low-level components at multiple scales. Riesz wavelet transform is employed to obtain multi-scale monogenic wavelets, which are formulated by quaternion representation. Instead of summing up the multi-scale monogenic representations, we consider all monogenic representations across multiple scales as individual features. For classification, two schemes were applied to integrate these multiple feature representations: a fusion-based method which combines the features efficiently and discriminately using the ultra-fast, optimized Multiple Kernel Learning (UFO-MKL) algorithm; and concatenation-based method where the features are combined into a single feature vector and classified by a linear SVM. Experiments carried out on a recent spontaneous micro-expression database demonstrated the capability of the proposed method in outperforming the state-of-the-art monogenic signal approach to solving the micro-expression recognition problem.","citedby-count":"48","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029157","afid":"60029157","affilname":"Universiti Malaya","affiliation-city":"Kuala Lumpur","affiliation-country":"Malaysia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012005","afid":"60012005","affilname":"Multimedia University","affiliation-city":"Selangor","affiliation-country":"Malaysia"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56102206700","authid":"56102206700","authname":"Oh Y.","surname":"Oh","given-name":"Yee Hui","initials":"Y.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012005"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35280390800","authid":"35280390800","authname":"Le Ngo A.","surname":"Le Ngo","given-name":"Anh Cat","initials":"A.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012005"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56227831000","authid":"56227831000","authname":"See J.","surname":"See","given-name":"John","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012005"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56529247200","authid":"56529247200","authname":"Liong S.","surname":"Liong","given-name":"Sze Teng","initials":"S.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029157"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8897889300","authid":"8897889300","authname":"Phan R.","surname":"Phan","given-name":"Raphael C.W.","initials":"R.C.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012005"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8552090200","authid":"8552090200","authname":"Ling H.","surname":"Ling","given-name":"Huo Chong","initials":"H.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012005"}]}],"authkeywords":"facial micro-expressions | Monogenic signal | quaternion representation | Riesz wavelet transform | UFO-MKL","article-number":"7252078","source-id":"21100510198","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84946105388"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84946105388?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84946105388&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84946105388&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84946105388","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84946105388","eid":"2-s2.0-84946105388","dc:title":"Mixed noise removal for color images using quaternion representation","dc:creator":"Wang D.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Southeast University (English Edition)","prism:issn":"10037985","prism:volume":"31","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"347-352","prism:coverDate":"2015-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 September 2015","prism:doi":"10.3969/j.issn.1003-7985.2015.03.008","dc:description":"In order to effectively restore color noisy images with the mixture of Gaussian noise and impulse noise, a new algorithm is proposed using the quaternion-based holistic processing idea for color images.

Finally, the quaternion optimal weights non-local means filter (QOWNLMF) for Gaussian noise removal is improved for the mixed noise removal.

Unsharp masking (UM) is the most classical tool for detail enhancement. Many generalizing UM approaches have been proposed, for example, the rational UM technique, the cubic unsharp technique, the adaptive UM technique and so on. For color images, these algorithms have three steps: (a) Implement the color2gray step; (b) design an extracting method of high frequency information (HFI) based on the luminance component (LC); (c) complete the enhancing process utilizing the HFI. However, using only the HFI of the LC may lose the HFI of the chrominance component (CC). This paper proposes a quaternion based detail enhancement algorithm to extract details of the color image using both of the luminance and CCs. The proposed algorithm is designed to address three tasks: (1) designing an extraction method of the color high frequency information (CHFI) based on quaternion description of the 3D vector rotation; (2) performing an effective fusion strategy of the CHFI and the gray high frequency information (GHFI); (3) designing a quaternion based measure method of the local dynamic range, based on which the enhancement coefficients of the proposed algorithm can be determined. The performance of the proposed algorithm compares favorably with many other similar enhancement algorithms. The eight parameters can be adjusted to control the sharpness to produce the desired results, which makes the proposed algorithm practically useful.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60102085","afid":"60102085","affilname":"Chengdu University","affiliation-city":"Chengdu","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023380","afid":"60023380","affilname":"Chongqing University","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016521","afid":"60016521","affilname":"Sichuan University","affiliation-city":"Chengdu","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14519471600","authid":"14519471600","authname":"Lang F.","surname":"Lang","given-name":"Fangnian","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102085"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/21234416400","authid":"21234416400","authname":"Zhou J.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Jiliu","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016521"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404591899","authid":"7404591899","authname":"Tang Y.","surname":"Tang","given-name":"Yuan Yan","initials":"Y.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9250649000","authid":"9250649000","authname":"Shang Z.","surname":"Shang","given-name":"Zhaowei","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023380"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color texture | image enhancement | quaternion algebra | unsharp masking technique | vector rotation","article-number":"1550038","source-id":"4000149107","fund-acr":"EPSRC","fund-no":"61173121","fund-sponsor":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84943583201"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84943583201?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84943583201&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84943583201&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0019057815001445"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84943583201","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84943583201","eid":"2-s2.0-84943583201","dc:title":"Full quaternion based finite-time cascade attitude control approach via pulse modulation synthesis for a spacecraft","dc:creator":"Mazinan A.","prism:publicationName":"ISA Transactions","prism:issn":"00190578","prism:volume":"58","prism:pageRange":"567-585","prism:coverDate":"2015-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"September 2015","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.isatra.2015.06.008","pii":"S0019057815001445","dc:description":"In the aspect of further development of investigations in the area of spacecraft modeling and analysis of the control scheme, a new hybrid finite-time robust three-axis cascade attitude control approach is proposed via pulse modulation synthesis. The full quaternion based control approach proposed here is organized in association with both the inner and the outer closed loops. It is shown that the inner closed loop, which consists of the sliding mode finite-time control approach, the pulse width pulse frequency modulator, the control allocation and finally the dynamics of the spacecraft is realized to track the three-axis referenced commands of the angular velocities. The pulse width pulse frequency modulators are in fact employed in the inner closed loop to accommodate the control signals to a number of on-off thrusters, while the control allocation algorithm provides the commanded firing times for the reaction control thrusters in the overactuated spacecraft. Hereinafter, the outer closed loop, which consists of the proportional linear control approach and the kinematics of the spacecraft is correspondingly designed to deal with the attitude angles that are presented by quaternion vector. It should be noted that the main motivation of the present research is to realize a hybrid control method by using linear and nonlinear terms and to provide a reliable and robust control structure, which is able to track time varying three-axis referenced commands. Subsequently, a stability analysis is presented to verify the performance of the overall proposed cascade attitude control approach. To prove the effectiveness of the presented approach, a thorough investigation is presented compared to a number of recent corresponding benchmarks.","citedby-count":"26","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027666","afid":"60027666","affilname":"Sharif University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016248","afid":"60016248","affilname":"K.

In this framework, the primary variable to model (i.e. grade, porosity, concentration, etc) is measured at discrete spatial locations and there may or may not be exhaustively sampled gridded secondary information. Existing geostatistical techniques require knowledge of the magnitude of anisotropy (correlation lengths) and local orientations (strike, dip, and plunge) exhaustively in the domain. Inference of these parameters from samples of the primary variable is difficult when anisotropy varies locally; the correlation lengths and orientations of the discrete primary variable must be estimated at all locations in a domain and are not globally constant. Estimation of the required LVA field parameters depends on the available data and is unique to the type of information available. This work proposes three different methodologies for LVA field inference, including (1) use of a correlated exhaustively sampled secondary variable (2) use of direct point measurements of the orientation of the primary variable, and (3) use of a geological model that displays the desired LVA characteristics. Often a gridded exhaustively sampled secondary variable is available from geophysical surveys and displays similar spatial features as the primary variable. An adaptive moving window technique is proposed to infer the required LVA field from correlated exhaustive secondary information. The local anisotropy orientation is obtained from the gradient of the secondary information and the appropriate window size is calculated automatically, which is important when the scale of features vary in the domain. Secondly, direct angle measurements of orientation may be available from dip meter or borehole images, however, these data are axial in nature (when plunge is assumed to be 0°) or they represent a 3D coordinate system (when considering strike, dip and plunge); preprocessing is required before the LVA field can be estimated from point measurements of orientation because of the wrapping effect at 0°. The proposed technique treats point measurements of orientation as quaternions and assigns weights to nearby samples to estimate the exhaustive LVA field. In addition to the proposed methodologies for exhaustive and point data, a skeletonization technique is implemented to determine orientations from geological interpretations. The geological object is reduced to a spline curve and the direction of the curve is used as the local LVA field orientation. The suite of proposed LVA inference techniques are implemented in both 2D and 3D and illustrated on several data sets.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030835","afid":"60030835","affilname":"University of Alberta","affiliation-city":"Edmonton","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55391702800","authid":"55391702800","authname":"Lillah M.","surname":"Lillah","given-name":"Maksuda","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030835"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23097007300","authid":"23097007300","authname":"Boisvert J.","surname":"Boisvert","given-name":"Jeff B.","initials":"J.B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030835"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030835"}]}],"authkeywords":"Geostatistics | Locally varying anisotropy | Modeling | Orientation | Resource estimation | Stationarity","source-id":"110327","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84922789672"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84922789672?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84922789672&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84922789672&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84922789672","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84922789672","eid":"2-s2.0-84922789672","dc:title":"Quaternion wiener deconvolution for noise robust color image registration","dc:creator":"Pedone M.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","prism:issn":"10709908","prism:volume":"22","prism:issueIdentifier":"9","prism:pageRange":"1278-1282","prism:coverDate":"2015-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 September 2015","prism:doi":"10.1109/LSP.2015.2398033","dc:description":"In this letter, we propose a global method for registering color images with respect to translation. Our approach is based on the idea of representing translations as convolutions with unknown shifted delta functions, and performing Wiener deconvolution in order to recover the shift between two images. We then derive a quaternionic version of the Wiener deconvolution filter in order to register color images. The use of Wiener filter also allows us to explicitly take into account the effect of noise. We prove that the well-known algorithm of phase correlation is a special case of our method, and we experimentally demonstrate the advantages of our approach by comparing it to other known generalizations of the phase correlation algorithm.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60063843","afid":"60063843","affilname":"Institute of Information Theory and Automation of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic","affiliation-city":"Prague","affiliation-country":"Czech Republic"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018216","afid":"60018216","affilname":"CINVESTAV Unidad Guadalajara","affiliation-city":"Guadalajara","affiliation-country":"Mexico"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012954","afid":"60012954","affilname":"Oulun Yliopisto","affiliation-city":"Oulu","affiliation-country":"Finland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25723759900","authid":"25723759900","authname":"Pedone M.","surname":"Pedone","given-name":"Matteo","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012954"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55995861000","authid":"55995861000","authname":"Bayro-Corrochano E.","surname":"Bayro-Corrochano","given-name":"Eduardo","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018216"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004642542","authid":"7004642542","authname":"Flusser J.","surname":"Flusser","given-name":"Jan","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60063843"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101917650","authid":"7101917650","authname":"Heikkila J.","surname":"Heikkila","given-name":"Janne","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012954"}]}],"authkeywords":"Clifford algebra | multivector derivative | phase correlation | quaternion | Wiener filter","article-number":"7029035","source-id":"17316","fund-no":"GA13-29225S","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84940182584"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84940182584?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84940182584&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84940182584&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84940182584","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84940182584","eid":"2-s2.0-84940182584","dc:title":"Image description using radial associated laguerre moments","dc:creator":"Pan B.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of ICT Research and Applications","prism:issn":"23375787","prism:eIssn":"23385499","prism:volume":"9","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"1-19","prism:coverDate":"2015-08-24","prism:coverDisplayDate":"24 August 2015","prism:doi":"10.5614/itbj.ict.res.appl.2015.9.1.1","dc:description":"This study proposes a new set of moment functions for describing gray-level and color images based on the associated Laguerre polynomials, which are orthogonal over the whole right-half plane. Moreover, the mathematical frameworks of radial associated Laguerre moments (RALMs) and associated rotation invariants are introduced. The proposed radial Laguerre invariants retain the basic form of disc-based moments, such as Zernike moments (ZMs), pseudo-Zernike moments (PZMs), Fourier-Mellin moments (OFMMs), and so on. Therefore, the rotation invariants of RALMs can be easily obtained. In addition, the study extends the proposed moments and invariants defined in a gray-level image to a color image using the algebra of quaternion to avoid losing some significant color information. Finally, the paper verifies the feature description capacities of the proposed moment function in terms of image reconstruction and invariant pattern recognition accuracy. Experimental results confirmed that the associated Laguerre moments (ALMs) perform better than orthogonal OFMMs in both noise-free and noisy conditions.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028628","afid":"60028628","affilname":"Northeastern University","affiliation-city":"Boston","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011069","afid":"60011069","affilname":"East China University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/126985255","afid":"126985255","affilname":"Ltd.","affiliation-city":"Baoji","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55363932900","authid":"55363932900","authname":"Pan B.","surname":"Pan","given-name":"Bojun","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028628"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56803542900","authid":"56803542900","authname":"Li Y.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Yihong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"126985255"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8538289200","authid":"8538289200","authname":"Zhu H.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Hongqing","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011069"}]}],"authkeywords":"Associated laguerre polynomials | Orthogonal laguerre moments | Quaternion | Radial-polar | Rotation invariants","source-id":"21100268428","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959283043"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959283043?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84959283043&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84959283043&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959283043","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84959283043","eid":"2-s2.0-84959283043","dc:title":"A sensor array system for the estimation of 3D body and parts movements","dc:creator":"Islam S.","prism:publicationName":"SACI 2015 - 10th Jubilee IEEE International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics, Proceedings","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781479999118"}],"prism:pageRange":"125-130","prism:coverDate":"2015-08-17","prism:coverDisplayDate":"17 August 2015","prism:doi":"10.1109/SACI.2015.7208184","dc:description":"This paper introduces a Sensor Array System for the 3D capture and representation of users' limb and body movements. It also develops a design and implementation of a Wireless Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Sensor Array. By placing sensors on one's arm, hand, upper leg and lower leg, data needed by the application developers to represent the body pose of the user in a virtual environment is provided at a minimum frame rate of 100 Hz. A central processing unit fuses all data and sends it over to a PC. Data fusion and processing algorithms consider the position of the sensors using a quaternion representation. This allows the sensor array to represent coherently the sensed movements and correct the errors of the gyroscope by using magnetic sensors data. Since this system is not tethered by wires and there is no requirement for the user to stay in a camera's field of view (FOV), the user has the full freedom of motion in a 3D Virtual Environment while equipped with a Virtual Reality (VR) headset. In a more complex setup, data from the Sensor Array can be fused with data provided by a 3D camera in order to bring the real or the avatar image of the user in the virtual environment. A general architecture of the Sensor Array System is provided. The architecture is designed to take into account the integration with the Sensor Array of other devices specific to the VR field, such as infrared cameras, joysticks, VR headsets and other game controllers. The functionality of the Sensor Array is finally illustrated by results obtained from real movements of the user while exploring a virtual environment.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028897","afid":"60028897","affilname":"University of Ottawa","affiliation-city":"Ottawa","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113813479","afid":"113813479","affilname":"Mgestyk Technologies, Inc.","affiliation-city":"Ottawa","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57225741250","authid":"57225741250","authname":"Islam S.","surname":"Islam","given-name":"Shahidul","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113813479"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26654220800","authid":"26654220800","authname":"Gadea C.","surname":"Gadea","given-name":"Cristian","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028897"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209188085","authid":"57209188085","authname":"Ionescu B.","surname":"Ionescu","given-name":"Bogdan","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113813479"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102900097","authid":"7102900097","authname":"Ionescu D.","surname":"Ionescu","given-name":"Dan","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028897"}]}],"authkeywords":"human-computer interaction | inertial measurement unit | magnetic angular rate and gravity | pose estimation | sensor array | virtual environments | virtual reality","article-number":"7208184","source-id":"21100448301","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
