Here, the complex-quaternion model of the vector hydrophone is proposed. The velocity elements are put in the position of the three imaginary parts, which retains the orthogonality of the velocity sensors. As the non-stationary properties of the surface vessel's radiated signals, the received data are divided into multiple frames. The covariance matrices and their vectorizations of each frame are calculated. An orthogonal projection is employed to eliminate the background noises. Then the noise-free covariance matrix is used to estimate the DOA's of the sources by taking use of MUSIC algorithm.

For IVF-ET, the successful rate largely depends on the receptivity of the endometrium, while there is potential application of digital image processing to help the automatic assessment of the receptivity of the endometrium. This paper studies proper methods to get quantitative analysis of HE (Hematoxylin-Eosin) staining medical images in the womb, including the number, density, area and perimeter of the glands. Instead of using monochrome analysis for color images, we represent the color medical images in the form of quaternion matrix to well preserve interrelationship between color channels. Quaternion Singular Value Decomposition (QSVD) is imposed on quaternion matrix to conduct dimension reduction of color vector data and to obtain color texture segmentation using k-means technique. Quaternion-based edge detection and pattern matching are then implemented on segmentation results to locate glands. Consequently, the quantitative analysis is available based on the extracted glands. Rather than reading a large number of medical images all by themselves, doctors can provide diagnosis more efficiently and more accurately using the proposed automatic quantitative analysis of pathological signal. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025084","afid":"60025084","affilname":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36604529700","authid":"36604529700","authname":"Han M.","surname":"Han","given-name":"Mingjia","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57199017141","authid":"57199017141","authname":"Zhou L.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Lin","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55695017800","authid":"55695017800","authname":"Xu Y.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Yi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]}],"authkeywords":"color edge detection | color texture segmentation | IVF-ET | k-means | QSVD | quantitative analysis | Quaternion","source-id":"17700155007","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84868004776"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84868004776?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84868004776&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84868004776&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84868004776","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84868004776","eid":"2-s2.0-84868004776","dc:title":"A quaternion widely linear series expansion and its applications","dc:creator":"Navarro-Moreno J.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","prism:issn":"10709908","prism:volume":"19","prism:issueIdentifier":"12","prism:pageRange":"868-871","prism:coverDate":"2012-11-02","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","prism:doi":"10.1109/LSP.2012.2221700","dc:description":"A series representation for continuous-time quaternion random signals is given.

Secondly, we derive a set of quaternion-valued invariants with respect to rotation, scaling and translation (RST) transformations for color face images based on the generalized QPZMs. Finally, color face recognition is carried out by combining these robust invariants with quaternion back propagation neural network (QBPNN).

The feature point extraction method called Mexican Hat wavelet scale interaction is used to select the points which can survive various attacks and also be used as reference points for both watermarking embedding and extraction. The normalization shape image of the local quadrangle image of which the four corners are feature points of the original image is invariant to translation, rotation, scaling and skew, by which we can obtain the relationship between the feature images of the original image and the watermarked image which has suffered with geometrical attacks. The proposed QWEMS and QWEXS schemes which denote the color pixel as a pure quaternion and the feature image as a quaternion matrix can improve the robustness and the imperceptibility of the embedding watermarking. To simplify the eigen-decomposition procedure of the quaternion matrix, we develop a calculation approach with which the eigen-values and the corresponding eigen-vectors of the quaternion matrix can be computed. A binary watermark image is embedded in the principal component coefficients of the feature image. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can survive a variety of geometry attacks, i.e. translation, rotation, scaling and skew, and can also resist the attacks of many signal processing procedures, for example, moderate JPEG compression, salt and pepper noise, Gaussian filtering, median filtering, and so on. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

If the electromagnetic (EM) interaction is sensitive to the triality symmetry, i.e. EM probe selects one triality sector, EM signals from the five transformed world would not be detected and be treated as the dark matter.

Simulations in the prediction setting support the analysis presented. © 2012 IEEE.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015150","afid":"60015150","affilname":"Imperial College London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35148333700","authid":"35148333700","authname":"Che Ujang B.","surname":"Che Ujang","given-name":"Bukhari","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56614550100","authid":"56614550100","authname":"Cheong Took C.","surname":"Cheong Took","given-name":"Clive","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006513328","authid":"7006513328","authname":"Mandic D.","surname":"Mandic","given-name":"Danilo P.","initials":"D.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]}],"authkeywords":"IIR filters | Nonlinear Adaptive Filtering | Quaternion Analyticity | Recurrent Neural Networks | RTRL","article-number":"6288329","source-id":"110544","fund-acr":"EPSRC","fund-no":"EP/H026266/1","fund-sponsor":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84867618214"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84867618214?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84867618214&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84867618214&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84867618214","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84867618214","eid":"2-s2.0-84867618214","dc:title":"Averaging stability analysis of a new attitude estimation algorithm","dc:creator":"Solo V.","prism:publicationName":"ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - Proceedings","prism:issn":"15206149","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781467300469"}],"prism:pageRange":"3289-3292","prism:coverDate":"2012-10-23","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288618","dc:description":"The most common approach to attitude estimation involves direct estimation of the rotation matrix or its associated quaternion.

The developed approach extracts robust phase information using 2-D quadrature filtering (both monogenic and quaternionic). The use of quadrature filters is motivated by their ability to jointly localize spatial and frequency domain phase information in the segmented ear images. This paper has developed two new techniques for biometric recognition: the quaternionic quadrature filter and the QuaternionicCode. We comparatively evaluate the performance of 1-D and 2-D local phase information using Cauchy, Gaussian derivative and log-Gabor band-pass quadrature filters. We detail experimental results, both for recognition and verification, using publicly available UND ear dataset and IITD ear database. The achieved results with 2-D quadrature filters are highly promising and achieve significantly improved performance as compared to conventional phase encoding using 1-D quadrature filters employed in the literature. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To overcome this disadvantage, this paper proposes a novel algorithm using quaternion and polarization rotation matrix on the basis of a uniform circular array (UCA) which is composed of cocenterd orthogonal loop and dipole (COLD) pairs. First, a quaternion mode is set and polarization parameters are separated from the array manifold. Then, DOA parameters are acquired using a two-dimensional searching process. Meanwhile, based on long-vector mode, a polarization rotation matrix is constructed, and closed-form estimation of polarization parameters is obtained. The presented algorithm has a large reduction in computational effort and an obvious improvement in precision for DOA estimation under low signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio.

The specially designed watermarks strongly improve the false positive rate of randomly selected images. The real singular values got from QSVD contain both luminance and chrominance information of the color image that ensure the watermarks to spread into all color components in the spatial domain.

Based on the dual number, a relative coupled dynamic equation is derived which can describe both the rotational motion and the translational motion of the chaser spacecraft relative to the target spacecraft, and the effect of rotation-translation coupling due to the point deviating from the center of the mass of the spacecraft. In the dual algebra, the feature lines and points are described uniformly. A multi-cue-based measurement model is proposed using the 2-D images of the feature lines and points fixed on the target spacecraft, and the iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF) is applied to estimate the relative state between the points off the center of the mass of the two spacecraft. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate that the proposed approach can provide an accurate estimation of the relative position and attitude of points deviating from the center of the mass of the spacecraft.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55949634900","authid":"55949634900","authname":"Wang J.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Jianying","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35604063300","authid":"35604063300","authname":"Liang H.","surname":"Liang","given-name":"Haizhao","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404240577","authid":"7404240577","authname":"Sun Z.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Zhaowei","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202974476","authid":"57202974476","authname":"Zhang S.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Shijie","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]}],"authkeywords":"Coupled dynamics | Dual quaternion | Kalman filter | State estimation | Vision measurement","source-id":"29006","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84866092040"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84866092040?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84866092040&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84866092040&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84866092040","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84866092040","eid":"2-s2.0-84866092040","dc:title":"Banknote classification by using contourlet and quaternion wavelet features","dc:creator":"Gai S.","prism:publicationName":"ICIC Express Letters","prism:issn":"1881803X","prism:volume":"6","prism:issueIdentifier":"9","prism:pageRange":"2295-2300","prism:coverDate":"2012-09-17","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","dc:description":"In order to improve the performance of the banknote image classification, the new feature extraction combined Contourlet and quaternion wavelet transform is proposed in this paper.

Design/methodology/approach - The nonlinear relative attitude dynamic and kinematic equations represented by relative quaternion and relative angular velocity, respectively, are considered in this paper. The lead filter is employed to synthesize virtual angular velocity signal so that the design of output feedback controller is achieved. Lyapunov method is adopted to prove the stability of closed-loop system. Considering the external disturbance, the theory of L2-gain disturbance attenuation is employed to improve the designed controller. Numerical simulations are carried out to verify the controllers proposed. Findings - It is found that the closed-loop system can be guaranteed asymptotically stable in absence of external disturbance. When disturbance is considered, as long as the sufficient condition proposed is satisfied, the improved controller can render system uniformly ultimately bounded stable. Practical implications - The proposed output feedback control scheme can be considered as a fall-back alternative for the case that the angular velocity sensors fail, or seen as another option for the system without angular velocity sensors at all. Originality/value - Unlike most classical works in the field of output feedback which focus on centralized scheme and neglect the disturbance, the controller proposed in this paper is able to handle the output feedback control problem of multi-agent formation in a decentralized fashion, so as to avoid the single failure point of a centralized scheme. Meanwhile, the capability of L2-gain disturbance attenuation is also achieved simultaneously. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36614398000","authid":"36614398000","authname":"Lv Y.","surname":"Lv","given-name":"Yueyong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8931326900","authid":"8931326900","authname":"Hu Q.","surname":"Hu","given-name":"Qinglei","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13403245700","authid":"13403245700","authname":"Ma G.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Guangfu","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204565852","authid":"57204565852","authname":"Zhang J.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Jian","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude regulation | Controllers | Cooperative attitude control | Decentralized output feedback | L2-gain | Spacecraft | Spacecraft formation flying","source-id":"12633","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84865594917"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84865594917?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84865594917&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84865594917&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84865594917","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84865594917","eid":"2-s2.0-84865594917","dc:title":"Quaternionic analytic signal using atomic functions","dc:creator":"Moya-Sánchez E.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783642332746"}],"prism:volume":"7441 LNCS","prism:pageRange":"699-706","prism:coverDate":"2012-09-05","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-33275-3_86","dc:description":"Atomic Functions are widely used in different applications in image processing, pattern recognition, computational physics and also in the digital interpretation of signal measurements.
