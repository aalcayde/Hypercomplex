By combining QFrOOFMMs with least square support vector regression, a dual color images watermarking scheme is investigated based on geometric correction. The original color watermark is encrypted by 3D sine map to enhance watermark security. A pure quaternion matrix can be obtained by performing the lifting wavelet transform, block division and the discrete cosine transform on the original color cover image. The robustness of the watermarking scheme is enhanced by executing the quaternion discrete Fourier transform on the quaternion matrix. Subsequently, the singular value matrix of the watermarked image with embedding operation is yielded by performing the quaternion singular value decomposition on the encryption watermark and the processed cover image. Before extracting the watermark, geometric distortion parameters to realize geometric correction are estimated by the least square support vector regression with the low-order QFrOOFMMs. Experimental results illustrate that the designed dual color images watermarking algorithm performs well in terms of imperceptibility and robustness, where the average PSNR value of the watermarked cover images is 61.6929 dB, and most of the NC values of the extracted watermarks are above 0.8500.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032504","afid":"60032504","affilname":"Shanghai University of Engineering Science","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008332","afid":"60008332","affilname":"Nanchang University","affiliation-city":"Nanchang","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/21739408600","authid":"21739408600","authname":"Gong L.H.","surname":"Gong","given-name":"Li Hua","initials":"L.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032504"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57398328600","authid":"57398328600","authname":"Luo H.X.","surname":"Luo","given-name":"Hui Xin","initials":"H.X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008332"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image watermarking | Geometric correction | Least square support vector regression | Quaternion fractional-order orthogonal Fourier-Mellin moments","article-number":"109665","source-id":"12346","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"YC2021-S148","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85160892452"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85160892452?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85160892452&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85160892452&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85160892452","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85160892452","eid":"2-s2.0-85160892452","dc:title":"Pneumonia detection with QCSA network on chest X-ray","dc:creator":"Singh S.","prism:publicationName":"Scientific Reports","prism:eIssn":"20452322","prism:volume":"13","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2023","prism:doi":"10.1038/s41598-023-35922-x","dc:description":"Worldwide, pneumonia is the leading cause of infant mortality. Experienced radiologists use chest X-rays to diagnose pneumonia and other respiratory diseases. The diagnostic procedure's complexity causes radiologists to disagree with the decision. Early diagnosis is the only feasible strategy for mitigating the disease's impact on the patent. Computer-aided diagnostics improve the accuracy of diagnosis. Recent studies established that Quaternion neural networks classify and predict better than real-valued neural networks, especially when dealing with multi-dimensional or multi-channel input. The attention mechanism has been derived from the human brain's visual and cognitive ability in which it focuses on some portion of the image and ignores the rest portion of the image. The attention mechanism maximizes the usage of the image's relevant aspects, hence boosting classification accuracy. In the current work, we propose a QCSA network (Quaternion Channel-Spatial Attention Network) by combining the spatial and channel attention mechanism with Quaternion residual network to classify chest X-Ray images for Pneumonia detection. We used a Kaggle X-ray dataset. The suggested architecture achieved 94.53% accuracy and 0.89 AUC. We have also shown that performance improves by integrating the attention mechanism in QCNN. Our results indicate that our approach to detecting pneumonia is promising.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60114539","afid":"60114539","affilname":"JSS Academy of Technical Education, Noida","affiliation-city":"Noida","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104351","afid":"60104351","affilname":"National Institute of Technology Patna","affiliation-city":"Patna","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/126659169","afid":"126659169","affilname":"Kebri Dehar University","affiliation-city":"Kebri Dehar","affiliation-country":"Ethiopia"}],"pubmed-id":"37270553","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57214306348","authid":"57214306348","authname":"Singh S.","surname":"Singh","given-name":"Sukhendra","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60114539"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58449523500","authid":"58449523500","authname":"Kumar M.","surname":"Kumar","given-name":"Manoj","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60114539"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57376577100","authid":"57376577100","authname":"Kumar A.","surname":"Kumar","given-name":"Abhay","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104351"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58299374100","authid":"58299374100","authname":"Verma B.K.","surname":"Verma","given-name":"Birendra Kumar","initials":"B.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60114539"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56879018800","authid":"56879018800","authname":"Shitharth S.","surname":"Shitharth","given-name":"S.","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"126659169"}]}],"article-number":"9025","source-id":"21100200805","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85164229072"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85164229072?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85164229072&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85164229072&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S016516842300244X"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85164229072","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85164229072","eid":"2-s2.0-85164229072","dc:title":"QRFODD: Quaternion Riesz fractional order directional derivative for color image edge detection","dc:creator":"Kaur K.","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing","prism:issn":"01651684","prism:volume":"212","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2023","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.sigpro.2023.109170","pii":"S016516842300244X","dc:description":"Edge detection is the prominent method to determine the discontinuities present in an image. There exists an issue of loss of information and correlation during the extraction of edges in color images. To resolve it, a novel quaternion domain based Riesz fractional order directional derivative approach is presented in this paper to extract more edge details in color images. The Riesz fractional masks obtained by utilizing Aitken interpolation are applied on color images in the quaternion domain for yielding the edge map as there is no need for recalculation of basis polynomials in case of the addition of any data point. The performance of the proposed quaternion based technique is analyzed on the benchmark BSDS300 and BSDS500 datasets in the terms of Figure of Merit and F-Score. The results obtained exhibit the efficiency of proposed technique over the classical and state-of-the-art edge detection approaches. The robustness of this approach is further established by taking into account uncontrolled conditions such as noise, JPEG compression, and varying illumination as it provided more features than the classical integer-order detectors. Moreover, the superiority of the proposed quaternion based technique is validated for medical images as well as its application in image enhancement.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60111704","afid":"60111704","affilname":"Chandigarh University","affiliation-city":"Mohali","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001166","afid":"60001166","affilname":"Thapar Institute of Engineering &amp; Technology","affiliation-city":"Patiala","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57197810480","authid":"57197810480","authname":"Kaur K.","surname":"Kaur","given-name":"Kanwarpreet","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60111704"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8571819900","authid":"8571819900","authname":"Jindal N.","surname":"Jindal","given-name":"Neeru","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001166"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26635862000","authid":"26635862000","authname":"Singh K.","surname":"Singh","given-name":"Kulbir","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001166"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color images | Fractional calculus | Image edge detection | Quaternion | Riesz fractional order derivative","article-number":"109170","source-id":"25548","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85156209229"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85156209229?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85156209229&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85156209229&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0377042723002236"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85156209229","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85156209229","eid":"2-s2.0-85156209229","dc:title":"Homogeneous ensemble model built from artificial neural networks for fault detection in navigation systems","dc:creator":"Świetlicka A.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics","prism:issn":"03770427","prism:volume":"432","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2023","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.cam.2023.115279","pii":"S0377042723002236","dc:description":"In this paper, authors present a modern approach to the detection of malfunctioning sensory systems.

Cracks in concrete structures can be a sign of deterioration, which may affect the overall safety of the building. Regular inspections and monitoring of surface cracks are essential to ensure the structural integrity of the building. However, human inspection can be time-consuming and subjective, leading to inconsistent findings. Hence, computer vision based crack recognition is necessary. In this work, we propose three custom designed deep networks and a multi resolution framework, named, Quaternionic wavelet transform (QWT) for crack recognition. The efficiency of deep network (machine crafted features) and QWT (hand crafted features) is studied in detail on three datasets namely SDNET2018, METU (Middle East Technical University) concrete crack image dataset and Historical-crack18-19 dataset. Also, the effect of wavelet scale on crack recognition and the implication of the fully connected layers in deep convolutional neural networks are studied in this research work.

The original images are first confused by fractal sorting square matrix and sine-logistic exponential chaotic map, and then the resulting image is divided into four matrices. With the quaternion symplectic form representation, a quaternion signal can be formed by the divided matrices, which can reduce the number of the discrete fractional Tchebyshev transforms used and enhance the computational efficiency. Subsequently, the quaternion array is encrypted with the proposed QDFrTMT. To overcome the weakness of the permutation-diffusion operation based on a single chaotic map, a Logistic-sine exponential chaotic map and a piece-wise linear chaotic map are cross-coupled. The final ciphertext images can be acquired by carrying out the dual-layer encryption processes in horizontal and vertical directions.

However, most existing quaternion SR methods adopt the quaternion ℓ1 norm, which penalizes all the entries of the quaternion sparse vector equally and ignores the differences and significance of different entries. Ideally, the entries with large magnitude should be less penalized while those with small magnitude (such as zero entries) should be more penalized. Therefore, we propose an Adaptive Weighted Quaternion Sparse Representation (AWQSR) method in this paper, which can learn weights for distinct entries of the quaternion sparse entries in an adaptive manner. Due to the noncommutativity of quaternion multiplication, it is difficult to tackle the resulting optimization problem of AWQSR. For this reason, we devise an effective iteratively reweighted optimization algorithm based on quaternion operators. To further improve the classification performance, we also develop a Supervised AWQSR based Classification (SAWQSRC) method by leveraging the label information of training samples to learn discriminative weights. Theoretical analysis of SAWQSRC has also been established to show that SAWQSRC succeeds in classification under appropriate conditions. The experiments on simulated data and real data prove the validity of the proposed methods for quaternion signal recovery and classification.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032955","afid":"60032955","affilname":"Huazhong Agricultural University","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188872929","authid":"57188872929","orcid":"0000-0002-2283-9048","authname":"Zou C.","surname":"Zou","given-name":"Cuiming","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032955"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003837546","authid":"7003837546","authname":"Kou K.I.","surname":"Kou","given-name":"Kit Ian","initials":"K.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404591899","authid":"7404591899","authname":"Tang Y.Y.","surname":"Tang","given-name":"Yuan Yan","initials":"Y.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57218448667","authid":"57218448667","authname":"Deng H.","surname":"Deng","given-name":"Hao","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032955"}]}],"authkeywords":"Quaternion sparse representation | Supervised learning | Weight learning","article-number":"109653","source-id":"24823","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"GP/026/2020","fund-sponsor":"Shanghai Science and Technology Development Foundation","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85125726434"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85125726434?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85125726434&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85125726434&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85125726434","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85125726434","eid":"2-s2.0-85125726434","dc:title":"A new in-air handwritten persian characters recognition method based on inertial sensor position estimation and convolutional neural network","dc:creator":"Meshkat F.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing","prism:issn":"18685137","prism:eIssn":"18685145","prism:volume":"14","prism:issueIdentifier":"10","prism:pageRange":"13097-13112","prism:coverDate":"2023-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"October 2023","prism:doi":"10.1007/s12652-022-03770-8","dc:description":"With advances in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), researchers have now become interested in the systems operating based on inertial signals.

Handwritten character recognition (HCR) is among such areas. This paper aimed to design, implement, and evaluate a novel system for the recognition of handwritten Farsi characters extracted from an inertial pen. For this purpose, a wireless inertial pen was designed. Its motion trajectory was then determined by combining the signals of its angular velocity and acceleration and using the concepts of navigation systems such as quaternion in order to estimate the position signals of characters. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was also employed to facilitate the extraction of high-level features and the classification of characters. The position signal was also extracted as an image used for model learning to enhance the classifier efficiency. The experimental results indicated the CNN-6 architecture outperformed the other CNN-n architectures in terms of character classification accuracy. According to the evaluation of the proposed method through test data, character recognition accuracies of Farsi letters and numbers were reported 91.06% and 94.52%, respectively. In comparison with the previous systems, the proposed method managed to improve the recognition of handwritten Farsi characters.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021967","afid":"60021967","affilname":"Razi University","affiliation-city":"Kermanshah","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57477355700","authid":"57477355700","authname":"Meshkat F.","surname":"Meshkat","given-name":"Farzaneh","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021967"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56282590600","authid":"56282590600","orcid":"0000-0002-6691-680X","authname":"Abdali-Mohammadi F.","surname":"Abdali-Mohammadi","given-name":"Fardin","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021967"}]}],"authkeywords":"Convolutional neural network | Feature extraction | Handwritten Persian characters recognition | Inertial signals","source-id":"19400158593","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85163193054"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85163193054?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85163193054&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85163193054&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0169743923001508"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85163193054","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85163193054","eid":"2-s2.0-85163193054","dc:title":"Near-infrared spectroscopy analysis of compound fertilizer based on GAF and quaternion convolution neural network","dc:creator":"Tan A.","prism:publicationName":"Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems","prism:issn":"01697439","prism:eIssn":"18733239","prism:volume":"240","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-09-15","prism:coverDisplayDate":"15 September 2023","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.chemolab.2023.104900","pii":"S0169743923001508","dc:description":"This paper combines near infrared spectroscopy with deep learning theory to propose a rapid identification method for compound fertilizer based on gramian angular field (GAF) image coding and quaternion convolutional neural network (QCNN). First, the near-infrared (NIR) spectra of 200 samples of two types of compound with and without polyglutamic acid (γ-PGA) were collected and pretreated by multivariate scattering correction(MSC) and first derivative methods. Then, the one-dimensional (1D) NIR spectra were transformed into two-dimensional (2D) images by GAF coding method to express the spectral information more intuitively. Finally, three images of Gramian angular difference field (GADF), Gramian angular summation field (GASF) and their average images were formed into a pure quaternion matrix for parallel representation and were analyzed by the designed QCNN. The peak features and minor features were mined based on the automatic learning function of multi-layer structure of QCNN to establish a high-performance, qualitative model for identifying compound fertilizer. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the identification model were 95.84%, 95.96% and 94.25%, respectively. Compared with the classification results based on traditional partial least square discrimination analysis(PLS-DA), principal component analysis combing with support vector machine classification(PCA-SVM), 1D convolution neural network (1DCNN) and GAF-CNN methods, the classification accuracy and adaptability of the model based on the proposed GAF-QCNN method have been significantly improved. The combination of GAF image of NIR spectra and QCNN developed in this study provides a novel approach for the intelligent modeling algorithm of NIR spectroscopy technology.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018465","afid":"60018465","affilname":"Yanshan University","affiliation-city":"Qinhuangdao","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011278","afid":"60011278","affilname":"Baylor University","affiliation-city":"Waco","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8979575900","authid":"8979575900","authname":"Tan A.","surname":"Tan","given-name":"Ailing","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57672658300","authid":"57672658300","authname":"Wang B.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Bolin","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55726071000","authid":"55726071000","authname":"Zhao Y.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Yong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57330189100","authid":"57330189100","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yunxin","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57976161800","authid":"57976161800","authname":"Zhao J.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Jing","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57848233600","authid":"57848233600","authname":"Wang A.X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Alan X.","initials":"A.X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011278"}]}],"authkeywords":"Compound fertilizer | Gramian angle field | Near infrared spectroscopy | Quaternion convolutional neural network","article-number":"104900","source-id":"24595","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"C2020203010","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85166648379"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85166648379?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85166648379&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85166648379&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1746809423007371"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85166648379","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85166648379","eid":"2-s2.0-85166648379","dc:title":"Adaptive multiple zero-watermarking based on local fast quaternion radial harmonic Fourier moments for color medical images","dc:creator":"Sheng T.","prism:publicationName":"Biomedical Signal Processing and Control","prism:issn":"17468094","prism:eIssn":"17468108","prism:volume":"86","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"September 2023","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.bspc.2023.105304","pii":"S1746809423007371","dc:description":"The copyright protection of medical images is receiving increasing attention. Zero-watermarking schemes are a critical technology for copyright protection of medical images and show better imperceptibility performance than embedded watermarking schemes. However, existing zero-watermarking schemes still have some limitations that prevent them from fully exploiting their potential, including failure against complex desynchronization attacks and high computational complexity. To this end, we propose a novel zero-watermarking scheme based on fast quaternion radial harmonic Fourier moments (FQRHFMs) that is resistant to desynchronization attacks. Specifically, this article formulates multiple local feature regions (LFRs) based on a speeded-up robust feature (SURF) operator and provides a fast computation method for QRHFMs by using fast Fourier transform (FFT). The magnitudes of FQRHFMs are computed in each incomplete overlapping LFR for generating multiple zero-watermarks to resist desynchronization attacks. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves state-of-the-art robustness against various desynchronization attacks (e.g., translation, cropping, and length-width ratio changing), and outperforms existing local zero-watermarking frameworks with regard to accuracy and efficiency.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016521","afid":"60016521","affilname":"Sichuan University","affiliation-city":"Chengdu","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/130037462","afid":"130037462","affilname":"Chishui Street Community Health Service Center","affiliation-city":"Chengdu","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58075307400","authid":"58075307400","orcid":"0009-0002-8086-1793","authname":"Sheng T.","surname":"Sheng","given-name":"Teng","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016521"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58521738800","authid":"58521738800","authname":"Zeng W.","surname":"Zeng","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"130037462"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58521990700","authid":"58521990700","authname":"Yang B.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Bin","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"130037462"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58075051300","authid":"58075051300","authname":"Fu C.","surname":"Fu","given-name":"Chunlong","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016521"}]}],"authkeywords":"Desynchronization attacks | Fast computation | Fast quaternion radial harmonic Fourier moments (FQRHFMs) | Zero-watermarking","article-number":"105304","source-id":"4700152237","fund-no":"QNJJ-2022-A04","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85162124240"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85162124240?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85162124240&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85162124240&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S174680942300561X"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85162124240","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85162124240","eid":"2-s2.0-85162124240","dc:title":"White blood cell automatic classification using deep learning and optimized quaternion hybrid moments","dc:creator":"Amine Tahiri M.","prism:publicationName":"Biomedical Signal Processing and Control","prism:issn":"17468094","prism:eIssn":"17468108","prism:volume":"86","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"September 2023","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.bspc.2023.105128","pii":"S174680942300561X","dc:description":"The structural characteristics of white blood cells (WBCs) can provide important information about human health status. For this reason, over the past four decades, researchers have sought ways to automate the classification and morphological analysis of white blood cells. In the present study, we propose a new method to classify white blood cells into four types: neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils by combining the hybrid discrete moment quaternion approach with deep learning. The proposed classification method is generally divided into two main phases: the first one is called the preprocessing phase, which is devoted to the computation of the image moments to be classified using a new quaternion Meixner-Charlier hybrid moment that is characterized by the following parameters α,β,andφ. In addition, the grey wolf optimization algorithm is used to guarantee high classification accuracy by optimizing the local parameters of the new quaternion Meixner-Charlier hybrid moments. The classification phase, which is the second phase of our proposed convolutional neural network model, is dedicated to introducing image moments. We present various graphical measurements, including receiver operating characteristics, precision-recall curves, and a confusion matrix. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our classification method, we also employ numerical measures such as the F1 score, loss, and accuracy. Our results indicate that the cell types of neutrophils were determined with a 98.53% accuracy rate, lymphocytes with a 98.16% accuracy rate, monocytes with a 97.43% accuracy rate, and eosinophils with a 97.43% accuracy rate.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024326","afid":"60024326","affilname":"Laboratoire d'Electronique, Signaux, Systèmes et d'Informatique, Université Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah","affiliation-city":"Fez","affiliation-country":"Morocco"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017021","afid":"60017021","affilname":"Université Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah","affiliation-city":"Fez","affiliation-country":"Morocco"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002714","afid":"60002714","affilname":"Université Cadi Ayyad","affiliation-city":"Marakech","affiliation-country":"Morocco"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58317615200","authid":"58317615200","authname":"Amine Tahiri M.","surname":"Amine Tahiri","given-name":"Mohamed","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024326"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216893383","authid":"57216893383","authname":"Zohra El hlouli F.","surname":"Zohra El hlouli","given-name":"Fatima","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017021"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221256972","authid":"57221256972","authname":"Bencherqui A.","surname":"Bencherqui","given-name":"Ahmed","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017021"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190495161","authid":"57190495161","orcid":"0000-0001-9225-8380","authname":"Karmouni H.","surname":"Karmouni","given-name":"Hicham","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002714"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201499521","authid":"57201499521","authname":"Amakdouf H.","surname":"Amakdouf","given-name":"Hicham","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017021"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55561914300","authid":"55561914300","authname":"Sayyouri M.","surname":"Sayyouri","given-name":"Mhamed","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017021"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12144280900","authid":"12144280900","authname":"Qjidaa H.","surname":"Qjidaa","given-name":"Hassan","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024326"}]}],"authkeywords":"Classification | Convolutional neural network | Metaheuristic algorithms | Quaternion discrete moments","article-number":"105128","source-id":"4700152237","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85161313586"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85161313586?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85161313586&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85161313586&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S092702562300280X"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85161313586","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85161313586","eid":"2-s2.0-85161313586","dc:title":"Implementation and comparison of algebraic and machine learning based tensor interpolation methods applied to fiber orientation tensor fields obtained from CT images","dc:creator":"Blarr J.","prism:publicationName":"Computational Materials Science","prism:issn":"09270256","prism:volume":"228","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"September 2023","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.commatsci.2023.112286","pii":"S092702562300280X","dc:description":"Fiber orientation tensors (FOT) are used as a compact form of representing the mechanically important quantity of fiber orientation in fiber reinforced composites. While they can be obtained via image processing methods from micro computed tomography scans (μCT), the specimen size needs to be sufficiently small for adequate resolution – especially in the case of carbon fibers. In order to avoid massive workload by scans and image evaluation when determining full-field FOT distributions for a plaque or a part, e.g., for comparison with process simulations, the possibilities of a direct interpolation of a few measured FOT at specific support points were opened in this paper. Hence, three different tensor interpolation methods were implemented and compared qualitatively with the help of visualization through tensor glyphs and quantitatively by calculating originally measured tensors at support points and evaluating the deviations. The methods compared in this work include two algebraic approaches, firstly, a Euclidean component averaging and secondly, a decomposition approach based on separate invariant and quaternion weighting, as well as an artificial intelligence (AI)-based method using an artificial neural network (ANN). While the decomposition method showed the best results visually, quantitatively the component averaging method and the neural network behaved better (that is for the type of quantitative error assessment used in this paper) with mean absolute errors of 0.105 and 0.114 when calculating previously measured tensors and comparing the components. With each method providing different advantages, the use for further application as well as necessary improvement is discussed. The authors would like to highlight the novelty of the methods being used with small and CT-based tensor datasets.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60102538","afid":"60102538","affilname":"Karlsruher Institut für Technologie","affiliation-city":"Karlsruhe","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073306","afid":"60073306","affilname":"Fraunhofer Institute for Chemical Technology ICT","affiliation-city":"Pfinztal","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016060","afid":"60016060","affilname":"Universität Augsburg","affiliation-city":"Augsburg","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014171","afid":"60014171","affilname":"University of Waterloo","affiliation-city":"Waterloo","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58127452800","authid":"58127452800","orcid":"0000-0003-0419-0780","authname":"Blarr J.","surname":"Blarr","given-name":"J.","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55814719900","authid":"55814719900","authname":"Sabiston T.","surname":"Sabiston","given-name":"T.","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014171"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216944781","authid":"57216944781","authname":"Krauß C.","surname":"Krauß","given-name":"C.","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57382234400","authid":"57382234400","orcid":"0000-0002-4931-5869","authname":"Bauer J.K.","surname":"Bauer","given-name":"J.

The proposed ProQCR method has the following merits: (1) Full supervision: In the representation and classification processes, the ProQCR method exploits the label information of training data, in contrast to prior methods using such supervision information only in the classification step. (2) Multi-channel integrality: ProQCR represents multiple color channels of each test color image as a quaternion linear combination of training data in a holistic manner. (3) Robustness: Equipped with the quaternion Huber loss function, ProQCR is robust against gross corruption in the test data. Experiments on benchmark databases demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of ProQCR for color face identification.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032955","afid":"60032955","affilname":"Huazhong Agricultural University","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188872929","authid":"57188872929","authname":"Zou C.","surname":"Zou","given-name":"Cuiming","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032955"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003837546","authid":"7003837546","authname":"Kou K.I.","surname":"Kou","given-name":"Kit Ian","initials":"K.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404591899","authid":"7404591899","authname":"Tang Y.Y.","surname":"Tang","given-name":"Yuan Yan","initials":"Y.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]}],"authkeywords":"Collaborative representation | Half-quadratic theory | Quaternion huber estimator | Quaternion representation","article-number":"109097","source-id":"25548","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"GP/026/2020","fund-sponsor":"Shanghai Science and Technology Development Foundation","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85153602529"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85153602529?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85153602529&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85153602529&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85153602529","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85153602529","eid":"2-s2.0-85153602529","dc:title":"A Powerful Zero-Watermarking Algorithm for Copyright Protection of Color Images Based on Quaternion Radial Fractional Hahn Moments and Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm","dc:creator":"Yamni M.","prism:publicationName":"Circuits, Systems, and Signal Processing","prism:issn":"0278081X","prism:eIssn":"15315878","prism:volume":"42","prism:issueIdentifier":"9","prism:pageRange":"5602-5633","prism:coverDate":"2023-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"September 2023","prism:doi":"10.1007/s00034-023-02379-2","dc:description":"In this paper, we propose a new zero-watermarking algorithm for copyright protection of color image based on a new type of fractional-order quaternion moments called quaternion radial fractional Hahn moments (QRFrHMs), the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, and a chaotic system that uses a mixed linear–nonlinear coupling based on two-dimensional CML (2DCML). The proposed QRFrHMs are defined by the projection of the color image on an orthogonal basis formed by a quaternion circular function and the fractional version of discrete orthogonal Hahn polynomials which depends on an additional fractional parameter α∈ R. The proposed zero-watermarking algorithm computes the QRFrHMs of the original image and then uses the ABC algorithm to choose the optimal parameters of the QRFrHMs. After that, the QRFrHMs with optimal parameters are used to construct a feature image called zero-watermark. The zero-watermark is used later to verify the copyright of the protected color image in a blind way. The combination of QRFrHMs and ABC algorithm gives the proposed zero-watermarking algorithm a high robustness with a bit error rate (BER) less than 0.03 for various attacks.

The breadth of real-world scenarios makes it difficult to find an optimal dehazing approach that works well for various applications.

The architecture's performance to dehaze images and its impact on real applications, such as object detection, is presented. The proposed single-image dehazing network is based on an encoder-decoder architecture capable of taking advantage of quaternion image representation without interrupting the quaternion dataflow end-to-end. We achieve this by introducing a novel quaternion pixel-wise loss function and quaternion instance normalization layer. The performance of the proposed QCNN-H quaternion framework is evaluated on two synthetic datasets, two real-world datasets, and one real-world task-oriented benchmark. Extensive experiments confirm that the QCNN-H outperforms state-of-the-art haze removal procedures in visual quality and quantitative metrics. Furthermore, the evaluation shows increased accuracy and recall of state-of-the-art object detection in hazy scenes using the presented QCNN-H method.

In the era of big data, the computation of image moments yields a huge memory demand, especially for large moment order and/or high-resolution images (i.e., megapixel images). The state-of-the-art moment computation methods successfully accelerate the image moment computation for digital images of a resolution smaller than 1K × 1K pixels. For digital images of higher resolutions, image moment computation is problematic. Researchers utilized GPU-based parallel processing to overcome this problem. In practice, the parallel computation of image moments using GPUs encounters the non-extended memory problem, which is the main challenge. This paper proposed a recurrent-based method for computing the Polar Complex Exponent Transform (PCET) moments of fractional orders. The proposed method utilized the symmetry of the image kernel to reduce kernel computation. In the proposed method, once a kernel value is computed in one quaternion, the other three corresponding values in the remaining three quaternions can be trivially computed. Moreover, the proposed method utilized recurrence equations to compute kernels. Thus, the required memory to store the pre-computed memory is saved. Finally, we implemented the proposed method on the GPU parallel architecture. The proposed method overcomes the memory limit due to saving the kernel's memory. The experiments show that the proposed parallel-friendly and memory-efficient method is superior to the state-of-the-art moment computation methods in memory consumption and runtimes. The proposed method computes the PCET moment of order 50 for an image of size 2K × 2K pixels in 3.5 seconds while the state-of-the-art method of comparison needs 7.0 seconds to process the same image, the memory requirements for the proposed method and the method of comparison for the were 67.0 MB and 3.4 GB, respectively. The method of comparison could not compute the image moment for any image with a resolution higher than 2K × 2K pixels. In contrast, the proposed method managed to compute the image moment up to 16K × 16K pixels image.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60274165","afid":"60274165","affilname":"Faculty of Computers and Information","affiliation-city":"Zagazig","affiliation-country":"Egypt"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60273339","afid":"60273339","affilname":"Faculty of Computers and Information","affiliation-city":"Asyut","affiliation-country":"Egypt"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032356","afid":"60032356","affilname":"Hunan University","affiliation-city":"Changsha","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/125807872","afid":"125807872","affilname":"University of Technology and Applied Sciences","affiliation-city":"Ibri","affiliation-country":"Oman"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58352451500","authid":"58352451500","authname":"Abdeltif A.M.","surname":"Abdeltif","given-name":"Amr M.","initials":"A.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60274165"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205214086","authid":"57205214086","orcid":"0000-0001-8065-8977","authname":"Hosny K.M.","surname":"Hosny","given-name":"Khalid M.","initials":"K.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60274165"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205229124","authid":"57205229124","authname":"Darwish M.M.","surname":"Darwish","given-name":"Mohamed M.","initials":"M.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60273339"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55586510800","authid":"55586510800","authname":"Salah A.","surname":"Salah","given-name":"Ahmad","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60274165"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"125807872"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404988992","authid":"7404988992","authname":"Li K.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Kenli","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"}]}],"authkeywords":"Fractional-order moments | Megapixel images | Memory-efficient | Parallel implementation | Recurrence algorithm","article-number":"100398","source-id":"21100356018","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85163098733"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85163098733?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85163098733&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85163098733&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0263224123006759"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85163098733","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85163098733","eid":"2-s2.0-85163098733","dc:title":"A large depth-of-field virtual measurement network for non-cooperative 6DOF pose estimation in occlusion scenes","dc:creator":"Deng Z.","prism:publicationName":"Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation","prism:issn":"02632241","prism:volume":"218","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-08-15","prism:coverDisplayDate":"15 August 2023","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.measurement.2023.113111","pii":"S0263224123006759","dc:description":"Six degrees of freedom (6DOF) measurement capable of determining the rigid transformation is a vital task in aerospace exploration and autonomous navigation. In this paper, a large depth-of-field virtual measurement network is proposed based on a moving rotating-prism-embedded camera to achieve 6DOF pose estimation for non-cooperative partially occluded targets. It includes stereo recovery using dense beam localization and accurate absolute orientation based on dual quaternions and adaptive scale factors. The former allows the three-dimensional (3D) extraction by multiview large-parallax imaging, while the latter enables the decoupling of translation and orientation without initial value estimation to avoid error accumulation. Compared to the mainstream methods, our method provides high-quality pose metrology, especially for depth extraction. The experiments show that the architecture allows the 3D reconstruction and non-cooperative 6DOF estimation with a large depth of field and object occlusion, solving the problem of difficult compromise between long-baseline imaging and compact configuration.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073652","afid":"60073652","affilname":"Tongji University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57215494542","authid":"57215494542","authname":"Deng Z.","surname":"Deng","given-name":"Zhaojun","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073652"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14063810200","authid":"14063810200","authname":"Li A.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Anhu","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073652"}]}],"authkeywords":"Large depth-of-field | Non-cooperative 6DOF estimation | Occlusion scenarios | Rotating prism | Virtual measurement network","article-number":"113111","source-id":"15424","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"22550711200","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85164216334"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85164216334?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85164216334&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85164216334&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0893608023003349"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85164216334","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85164216334","eid":"2-s2.0-85164216334","dc:title":"A novel framework of prescribed time/fixed time/finite time stochastic synchronization control of neural networks and its application in image encryption","dc:creator":"Wang X.","prism:publicationName":"Neural Networks","prism:issn":"08936080","prism:eIssn":"18792782","prism:volume":"165","prism:pageRange":"755-773","prism:coverDate":"2023-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"August 2023","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.neunet.2023.06.023","pii":"S0893608023003349","dc:description":"In this paper, we investigate a novel framework for achieving prescribed-time (PAT), fixed-time (FXT) and finite-time (FNT) stochastic synchronization control of semi-Markov switching quaternion-valued neural networks (SMS-QVNNs), where the setting time (ST) of PAT/FXT/FNT stochastic synchronization control is effectively preassigned beforehand and estimated.

However, the existing image-based visual servo (IBVS) control methods rely on strict target visibility assumptions or impose excessive constraints on the quadrotor's agility to meet this requirement. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the visibility constraint defined in prior works remains unverified in aggressive flight tests. To address these issues, we present a robust IBVS scheme for quadrotors to perform aggressive maneuvers while ensuring target visibility. Based on the nonlinear model-predictive control framework, we propose a novel underactuation compensation scheme to eliminate the need for a virtual camera frame, which enables us to formulate the true target visibility constraint. We then introduce a quaternion-based representation of spherical visual features to handle the nonsmooth vector field problem on the 2-sphere and derive its corresponding image kinematics. We validate our method through three challenging visual servo tasks where agile maneuvers are desired: fast landing, aggressive long-distance flight, and dynamic object tracking. Extensive simulation and experiment show that our method consistently achieves a target-visible rate of 100% in all the image frames, even under a maximum pitch of 21.04°. The results validate the effectiveness of our visibility constraint under large robot rotations and underscore its importance in enabling robust and aggressive flights.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071030","afid":"60071030","affilname":"University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies","affiliation-city":"Toronto","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025084","afid":"60025084","affilname":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57295739100","authid":"57295739100","orcid":"0000-0003-3533-8143","authname":"Qin C.","surname":"Qin","given-name":"Chao","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60071030"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57316464100","authid":"57316464100","orcid":"0000-0002-9906-8800","authname":"Yu Q.","surname":"Yu","given-name":"Qiuyu","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58303090000","authid":"58303090000","orcid":"0000-0001-9727-2472","authname":"Go H.S.H.","surname":"Go","given-name":"H.

Because control systems directly affect the motion of the robot, data-driven methods, especially black box approaches, need to be used with caution considering aspects such as stability and interpretability. In this letter, we describe a differentiable and hierarchical control architecture. The proposed representation, called multi-abstractive neural controller, uses the input image to control the transitions within a novel discrete behavior planner (referred to as the visual automaton generative network, or vAGN). The output of a vAGN controls the parameters of a set of dynamic movement primitives which provides the system controls. We train this neural controller with real-world driving data via behavior cloning and show improved explainability, sample efficiency, and similarity to human driving.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022195","afid":"60022195","affilname":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Cambridge","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016849","afid":"60016849","affilname":"University of Toronto","affiliation-city":"Toronto","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006320","afid":"60006320","affilname":"MIT Computer Science &amp; Artificial Intelligence Laboratory","affiliation-city":"Cambridge","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/127257731","afid":"127257731","affilname":"Toyota Research Institute","affiliation-city":"Chicago","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206744129","authid":"57206744129","orcid":"0000-0003-2565-9883","authname":"Li X.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Xiao","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006320"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55415577300","authid":"55415577300","orcid":"0000-0001-6426-365X","authname":"Gilitschenski I.","surname":"Gilitschenski","given-name":"Igor","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016849"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602873213","authid":"6602873213","orcid":"0000-0002-9334-1706","authname":"Rosman G.","surname":"Rosman","given-name":"Guy","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"127257731"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24923242500","authid":"24923242500","orcid":"0000-0002-2225-7275","authname":"Karaman S.","surname":"Karaman","given-name":"Sertac","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022195"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57218886083","authid":"57218886083","orcid":"0000-0001-5473-3566","authname":"Rus D.","surname":"Rus","given-name":"Daniela","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006320"}]}],"authkeywords":"Autonomous driving | path planning | robot learning","source-id":"21100900379","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85159827727"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85159827727?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85159827727&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85159827727&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85159827727","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85159827727","eid":"2-s2.0-85159827727","dc:title":"A Distributed, Event-Triggered, Adaptive Controller for Cooperative Manipulation with Rolling Contacts","dc:creator":"Cortez W.S.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","prism:issn":"15523098","prism:eIssn":"19410468","prism:volume":"39","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"3120-3133","prism:coverDate":"2023-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 August 2023","prism:doi":"10.1109/TRO.2023.3268595","dc:description":"We present a distributed, event-triggered, and adaptive control algorithm for cooperative object manipulation with rolling contacts and unknown dynamic parameters. Whereas conventional cooperative manipulation methods require rigid contact points, our approach exploits rolling effects of passive end-effectors and does not require force/torque sensing. The removal of rigidity allows for more modular grasping, increased application to more object types, and online adjustment of the grasp. The proposed control algorithm exhibits the following properties: 1) it is distributed, in the sense that the robotic agents calculate their own control signal, under an event-triggered communication scheme. Such a scheme reduces the interagent communication requirements with respect to continuous communication schemes; 2) it uses an online adaptation mechanism to accommodate for unknown dynamic parameters of the object and the agents and 3) it adapts existing internal force controllers to guarantee no slip throughout the manipulation task despite the event-triggered nature of the communication scheme. Hardware implementation validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023471","afid":"60023471","affilname":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","affiliation-city":"Richland","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003858","afid":"60003858","affilname":"Uppsala Universitet","affiliation-city":"Uppsala","affiliation-country":"Sweden"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002014","afid":"60002014","affilname":"The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)","affiliation-city":"Stockholm","affiliation-country":"Sweden"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55848824000","authid":"55848824000","orcid":"0000-0002-1809-5656","authname":"Cortez W.S.","surname":"Cortez","given-name":"Wenceslao Shaw","initials":"W.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023471"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56043456900","authid":"56043456900","orcid":"0000-0002-4289-2866","authname":"Verginis C.K.","surname":"Verginis","given-name":"Christos K.","initials":"C.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003858"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6506281602","authid":"6506281602","orcid":"0000-0001-7309-8086","authname":"Dimarogonas D.V.","surname":"Dimarogonas","given-name":"Dimos V.","initials":"D.V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002014"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive control | cooperative systems | decentralized control | manipulators | multi-agent systems | multi-robot systems","source-id":"95101","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85151788364"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85151788364?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85151788364&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85151788364&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0952197623004189"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85151788364","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85151788364","eid":"2-s2.0-85151788364","dc:title":"Quaternion convolutional neural networks for hyperspectral image classification","dc:creator":"Zhou H.","prism:publicationName":"Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","prism:issn":"09521976","prism:volume":"123","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"August 2023","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.engappai.2023.106234","pii":"S0952197623004189","dc:description":"Quaternion convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) can capture quaternion features, which contain not only the contextual information among quaternion feature units but also utilize the quaternion algebra inside the quaternion feature units to express structural information. However, building efficient QCNNs for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is a challenge due to the lack of methods to map real features into quaternion features and the missing key quaternion modules. This paper proposes methodologies to build QCNNs specifically for HSI classification and designs several key quaternion modules. Firstly, a novel quaternion feature encoder is presented to map real HSI features into quaternion features. Secondly, a paradigm is designed to conveniently modify classical convolutional neural networks to implement QCNNs for HSI classification. Thirdly, we propose a new separable quaternion convolutional neural network (SQNet) based on presented advanced quaternion modules, such as separable quaternion convolutions and quaternion attention mechanisms. In addition, the computational rules in quaternion neurons are improved to enhance the adaptability of QCNNs. Experiments conducted on four widely used HSI datasets indicate that the implemented QCNNs and the proposed SQNet achieve satisfactory results for HSI classification with limited training samples.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023237","afid":"60023237","affilname":"Beijing Normal University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013551","afid":"60013551","affilname":"China Agricultural University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/126149005","afid":"126149005","affilname":"Ltd.","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216217214","authid":"57216217214","authname":"Zhou H.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Heng","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013551"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57196396566","authid":"57196396566","authname":"Zhang X.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023237"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57223020406","authid":"57223020406","authname":"Zhang C.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Chunlei","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"126149005"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216152458","authid":"57216152458","authname":"Ma Q.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Qiaoyu","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013551"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attention mechanism | Hyperspectral image classification | Quaternion convolution | Quaternion encoder | Quaternion neural network","article-number":"106234","source-id":"24182","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"11871104","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85151698601"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85151698601?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85151698601&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85151698601&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0096300323001406"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85151698601","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85151698601","eid":"2-s2.0-85151698601","dc:title":"Hyperbolic linear canonical transforms of quaternion signals and uncertainty","dc:creator":"Morais J.","prism:publicationName":"Applied Mathematics and Computation","prism:issn":"00963003","prism:volume":"450","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 August 2023","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.amc.2023.127971","pii":"S0096300323001406","dc:description":"This paper is concerned with Linear Canonical Transforms (LCTs) associated with two-dimensional quaternion-valued signals defined in an open rectangle of the Euclidean plane endowed with a hyperbolic measure, which we call Quaternion Hyperbolic Linear Canonical Transforms (QHLCTs). These transforms are defined by replacing the Euclidean plane wave with a corresponding hyperbolic relativistic plane wave in one dimension multiplied by quadratic modulations in both the hyperbolic spatial and frequency domains, giving the hyperbolic counterpart of the Euclidean LCTs. We prove the fundamental properties of the partial QHLCTs and the right-sided QHLCT by employing hyperbolic geometry tools and establish main results such as the Riemann–Lebesgue Lemma, the Plancherel and Parseval Theorems, and inversion formulas. The analysis is carried out in terms of novel hyperbolic derivative and hyperbolic primitive concepts, which lead to the differentiation and integration properties of the QHLCTs. The results are applied to establish two quaternionic versions of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for the right-sided QHLCT. These uncertainty principles prescribe a lower bound on the product of the effective widths of quaternion-valued signals in the hyperbolic spatial and frequency domains. It is shown that only hyperbolic Gaussian quaternion functions minimize the uncertainty relations.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60116730","afid":"60116730","affilname":"Centro de Investigação e Desenvolvimento em Matemática e Aplicações","affiliation-city":"Aveiro","affiliation-country":"Portugal"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60056189","afid":"60056189","affilname":"School of Technology and Management","affiliation-city":"Leiria","affiliation-country":"Portugal"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030473","afid":"60030473","affilname":"Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México","affiliation-city":"Mexico City","affiliation-country":"Mexico"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/19639247200","authid":"19639247200","orcid":"0000-0001-7045-0224","authname":"Morais J.","surname":"Morais","given-name":"J.","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60056189"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12144179800","authid":"12144179800","authname":"Ferreira M.","surname":"Ferreira","given-name":"M.","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030473"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60116730"}]}],"authkeywords":"Heisenberg uncertainty principles | Plancherel and Parseval theorems | Quaternion hyperbolic linear canonical transforms | Quaternionic analysis | Riemann–Lebesgue lemma","article-number":"127971","source-id":"25170","fund-acr":"FCT","fund-no":"UIDB/04106/2020","fund-sponsor":"Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherhybridgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Hybrid Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}}]}}
