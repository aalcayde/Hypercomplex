However, the conventional learning methods always become ineffective in noise environment due to the least-square regression, which usually generates distorted representations for noisy inputs they employed for error modeling. To solve this problem, in this article, we propose a modal regression-based graph representation (MRGR) model for noisy face hallucination. In MRGR, the modal regression-based function is incorporated into graph learning framework to improve the resolution of noisy face images. Specifically, the modal regression-induced metric is used instead of the least-square metric to regularize the encoding errors, which admits the MRGR to robust against noise with uncertain distribution. Moreover, a graph representation is learned from feature space to exploit the inherent typological structure of patch manifold for data representation, resulting in more accurate reconstruction coefficients. Besides, for noisy color face hallucination, the MRGR is extended into quaternion (MRGR-Q) space, where the abundant correlations among different color channels can be well preserved. Experimental results on both the grayscale and color face images demonstrate the superiority of MRGR and MRGR-Q compared with several state-of-the-art methods.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032356","afid":"60032356","affilname":"Hunan University","affiliation-city":"Changsha","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024542","afid":"60024542","affilname":"South China University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"pubmed-id":"34487500","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55970181500","authid":"55970181500","orcid":"0000-0003-4891-9211","authname":"Liu L.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Licheng","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57217604244","authid":"57217604244","orcid":"0000-0001-5451-7230","authname":"Chen C.L.P.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"C.

Therefore, image denoising is essential for image processing. Specially, the critical challenge of image denoising is to remove the noise while preserving information as much as possible. Generally, the group-based sparse representation model is exploited to restore the clean image, due to the self-similarity of natural images. This paper offered a novel color image denoising method that utilized quaternions in the group sparsity model, where each pixel was expressed as a pure quaternion. Initially, each pixel of the observed image was expressed as a quaternion unit, and a quaternion patch group matrix was established by Pearson′s correlation coefficient. The proposed model then learnt the dictionary for each patch group, working well with the pursuit algorithm. In other words, the group-based sparsity method assumed that each patch group was a linear combination of the basic elements of the dictionary. Unfortunately, it remained arduous to reconstruct the image structure precisely. Therefore, the group sparsity model incorporated kernel Wiener filtering to enhance image structure quality. In contrast to the traditional models, the new model not only worked with the corresponding RGB channels, but also leveraged the relationship between patches. Fueled by the exploration of the inner correlation of color channels, the proposed method could preserve the image information as much as possible while removing noise. The experiments validated the efficiency of the proposed method both in numerical results and visual performance on different noise levels.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60122420","afid":"60122420","affilname":"Shandong University of Finance and Economics","affiliation-city":"Jinan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073726","afid":"60073726","affilname":"Ludong University","affiliation-city":"Yantai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031031","afid":"60031031","affilname":"Shandong University","affiliation-city":"Jinan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57208439928","authid":"57208439928","authname":"Shi M.W.","surname":"Shi","given-name":"Miao Wen","initials":"M.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031031"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57200248389","authid":"57200248389","authname":"Fan L.W.","surname":"Fan","given-name":"Lin Wei","initials":"L.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122420"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211005343","authid":"57211005343","authname":"Wang H.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Hua","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073726"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57225061094","authid":"57225061094","authname":"Zhang C.M.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Cai Ming","initials":"C.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031031"}]}],"authkeywords":"Image denoising | Patch grouping | Principal component analysis | Quaternion analysis | Sparse representation","source-id":"21101120334","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"62002200","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85145358283"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85145358283?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85145358283&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85145358283&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0957417422024861"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85145358283","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85145358283","eid":"2-s2.0-85145358283","dc:title":"Key frame extraction based on quaternion Fourier transform with multiple features fusion","dc:creator":"Zhang Y.","prism:publicationName":"Expert Systems with Applications","prism:issn":"09574174","prism:volume":"216","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-04-15","prism:coverDisplayDate":"15 April 2023","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.eswa.2022.119467","pii":"S0957417422024861","dc:description":"Key frame extraction, an important technique to improve video viewing efficiency and reduce video redundancy, has attracted considerable attention. Notwithstanding, existing key frame extraction for surveillance video not only fails to extract the local detail information of the target accurately but also preprocess the image with grayscale, so the integrity of the image information is also damaged. In order to solve the above-described problems, the paper presents a key frame extraction method based on the quaternion Fourier transform with the multiple features fusion. Initially, the method extracts dynamic and static features that can characterize the color image information separately. Then, the quaternion matrix is used to perform the quaternion Fourier transform on the different features to obtain the fused phase spectrum of the Fourier transform. Immediately after, the information containing the overall structure of the image is filtered by Gaussian filtering, and the quaternion Fourier inverse transform is performed to obtain the fused feature map. Finally, an adaptive key frame filtering criterion, which uses the fused feature map to extract the key frames is constructed in this paper for accurately extracting key frames. Notably, experimental results indicate that the proposed method ensures the integrity of the image information while accurately capturing the global and local motion state of the target.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032274","afid":"60032274","affilname":"Shijiazhuang Tiedao University","affiliation-city":"Shijiazhuang","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008950","afid":"60008950","affilname":"The Australian National University","affiliation-city":"Canberra","affiliation-country":"Australia"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/37033152800","authid":"37033152800","authname":"Zhang Y.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Yunzuo","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032274"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57223345994","authid":"57223345994","authname":"Zhang J.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Jiayu","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032274"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57873422100","authid":"57873422100","authname":"Liu R.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Ruixue","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008950"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56202447800","authid":"56202447800","authname":"Zhu P.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Pengfei","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032274"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57873970300","authid":"57873970300","authname":"Liu Y.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Yameng","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032274"}]}],"authkeywords":"Key frame extraction | Local motion state | Multiple features fusion | Quaternion Fourier transform","article-number":"119467","source-id":"24201","fund-acr":"STDU","fund-no":"226Z0501G","fund-sponsor":"Shijiazhuang Tiedao University","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85151044012"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85151044012?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85151044012&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85151044012&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85151044012","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85151044012","eid":"2-s2.0-85151044012","dc:title":"Quaternion attention multi-scale widening network for endoscopy image super-resolution","dc:creator":"Lin J.","prism:publicationName":"Physics in Medicine and Biology","prism:issn":"00319155","prism:eIssn":"13616560","prism:volume":"68","prism:issueIdentifier":"7","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-04-07","prism:coverDisplayDate":"7 April 2023","prism:doi":"10.1088/1361-6560/acc002","dc:description":"Objective. In the field of endoscopic imaging, Super-Resolution (SR) plays an important role in Manufactured Diagnosis, physicians and machine Automatic Diagnosis. Although many recent studies have been performed, by using deep convolutional neural networks on endoscopic SR, most of the methods have large parameters, which limits their practical application. In addition, almost all of these methods treat each channel equally based on the real-valued domain, without considering the difference among the different channels. Our objective is to design a SR model named Quaternion Attention Multi-scale Widening Network (QAMWN) for endoscopy images to address the above problem. Approach. QAMWN contains a stacked Quaternion Attention Multi-Scale Widening Block, that composed of Multi-scale Feature Widening Aggregation Module (MFWAM) and Quaternion Residual Channel Attention (QRCA). The MFWAM adopts multi-scale architecture with step-wise widening on feature channels for better feature extraction; and in QRCA, quaternion is introduced to construct Residual Channel Attention Mechanism, which obtains adaptively scales features by considering compact cross-channel interactions in the hyper-complex domain. Main results. To verify the efficacy of our method, it is performed on two public endoscopic datasets, CVC ClinicDB and Kvasir dataset. The experimental results show that our proposed method can achieve a better trade-off in model size and performance. More importantly, the proposed QAMWN outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both metrics and visualization. Significance. We propose a lightweight SR network for endoscopy and achieves better performance with fewer parameters, which helps in clinical diagnosis of endoscopy.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073533","afid":"60073533","affilname":"Guangzhou Red Cross Hospital","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60072904","afid":"60072904","affilname":"Macao Polytechnic University","affiliation-city":"Macau","affiliation-country":"Macao"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026981","afid":"60026981","affilname":"Xi'an University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007155","afid":"60007155","affilname":"Guangdong University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"36854191","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221119315","authid":"57221119315","authname":"Lin J.","surname":"Lin","given-name":"Junyu","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007155"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56007342500","authid":"56007342500","orcid":"0000-0002-3640-3229","authname":"Huang G.","surname":"Huang","given-name":"Guoheng","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007155"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58160545100","authid":"58160545100","authname":"Huang J.","surname":"Huang","given-name":"Jun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073533"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36562860900","authid":"36562860900","authname":"Yuan X.","surname":"Yuan","given-name":"Xiaochen","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60072904"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58160606100","authid":"58160606100","authname":"Zeng Y.","surname":"Zeng","given-name":"Yiwen","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007155"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195378613","authid":"57195378613","authname":"Shi C.","surname":"Shi","given-name":"Cheng","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026981"}]}],"authkeywords":"endoscopy | multi-scale | quaternion-valued convolution | super-resolution","article-number":"075012","source-id":"29203","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"2020B1212060069","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85156094472"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85156094472?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85156094472&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85156094472&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85156094472","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85156094472","eid":"2-s2.0-85156094472","dc:title":"One-Dimensional Quaternion Fourier Transform with Application to Probability Theory","dc:creator":"Ekasasmita W.","prism:publicationName":"Symmetry","prism:eIssn":"20738994","prism:volume":"15","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2023","prism:doi":"10.3390/sym15040815","dc:description":"The Fourier transform occupies a central place in applied mathematics, statistics, computer sciences, and engineering.

We finally study the application of this transformation in probability theory.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60069390","afid":"60069390","affilname":"Hasanuddin University","affiliation-city":"Makassar","affiliation-country":"Indonesia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/129612128","afid":"129612128","affilname":"Institut Teknologi Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie","affiliation-city":"Pare-Pare","affiliation-country":"Indonesia"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58221873200","authid":"58221873200","orcid":"0000-0003-1210-3739","authname":"Ekasasmita W.","surname":"Ekasasmita","given-name":"Wahyuni","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069390"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"129612128"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24491506600","authid":"24491506600","orcid":"0000-0003-1628-9163","authname":"Bahri M.","surname":"Bahri","given-name":"Mawardi","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069390"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58221656900","authid":"58221656900","authname":"Bachtiar N.","surname":"Bachtiar","given-name":"Nasrullah","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069390"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194339989","authid":"57194339989","authname":"Rahim A.","surname":"Rahim","given-name":"Amran","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069390"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57196476123","authid":"57196476123","orcid":"0000-0001-5258-3867","authname":"Nur M.","surname":"Nur","given-name":"Muhammad","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069390"}]}],"authkeywords":"convolution | probability theory | quaternion characteristic function | quaternion Fourier transform","article-number":"815","source-id":"21100201542","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85153967893"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85153967893?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85153967893&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85153967893&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85153967893","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85153967893","eid":"2-s2.0-85153967893","dc:title":"Benchmarking Dataset of Signals from a Commercial MEMS Magnetic–Angular Rate–Gravity (MARG) Sensor Manipulated in Regions with and without Geomagnetic Distortion","dc:creator":"Sonchan P.","prism:publicationName":"Sensors","prism:issn":"14248220","prism:volume":"23","prism:issueIdentifier":"8","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2023","prism:doi":"10.3390/s23083786","dc:description":"In this paper, we present the FIU MARG Dataset (FIUMARGDB) of signals from the tri-axial accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer contained in a low-cost miniature magnetic–angular rate–gravity (MARG) sensor module (also known as magnetic inertial measurement unit, MIMU) for the evaluation of MARG orientation estimation algorithms. The dataset contains 30 files resulting from different volunteer subjects executing manipulations of the MARG in areas with and without magnetic distortion. Each file also contains reference (“ground truth”) MARG orientations (as quaternions) determined by an optical motion capture system during the recording of the MARG signals. The creation of FIUMARGDB responds to the increasing need for the objective comparison of the performance of MARG orientation estimation algorithms, using the same inputs (accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer signals) recorded under varied circumstances, as MARG modules hold great promise for human motion tracking applications. This dataset specifically addresses the need to study and manage the degradation of orientation estimates that occur when MARGs operate in regions with known magnetic field distortions. To our knowledge, no other dataset with these characteristics is currently available. FIUMARGDB can be accessed through the URL indicated in the conclusions section. It is our hope that the availability of this dataset will lead to the development of orientation estimation algorithms that are more resilient to magnetic distortions, for the benefit of fields as diverse as human–computer interaction, kinesiology, motor rehabilitation, etc.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015206","afid":"60015206","affilname":"Florida International University","affiliation-city":"Miami","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"pubmed-id":"37112128","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56308078000","authid":"56308078000","orcid":"0000-0003-2014-5816","authname":"Sonchan P.","surname":"Sonchan","given-name":"Pontakorn","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015206"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203136289","authid":"57203136289","orcid":"0000-0003-1891-2115","authname":"Ratchatanantakit N.","surname":"Ratchatanantakit","given-name":"Neeranut","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015206"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56902559100","authid":"56902559100","authname":"O-larnnithipong N.","surname":"O-larnnithipong","given-name":"Nonnarit","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015206"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004124475","authid":"7004124475","authname":"Adjouadi M.","surname":"Adjouadi","given-name":"Malek","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015206"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7007109179","authid":"7007109179","orcid":"0000-0002-5572-284X","authname":"Barreto A.","surname":"Barreto","given-name":"Armando","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015206"}]}],"authkeywords":"dataset | MARG | MIMU | orientation algorithm benchmarking | orientation estimation | sensor fusion algorithm","article-number":"3786","source-id":"130124","fund-acr":"NSF","fund-no":"CNS-1920182","fund-sponsor":"National Science Foundation","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85152351549"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85152351549?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85152351549&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85152351549&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85152351549","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85152351549","eid":"2-s2.0-85152351549","dc:title":"Quaternion Wavelet Transform and a Feedforward Neural Network-Aided Intelligent Distributed Optical Fiber Sensing System","dc:creator":"Fan L.","prism:publicationName":"Sensors","prism:issn":"14248220","prism:volume":"23","prism:issueIdentifier":"7","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2023","prism:doi":"10.3390/s23073637","dc:description":"In this paper, aiming at a large infrastructure structural health monitoring network, a quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) image denoising algorithm is proposed to process original data, and a depth feedforward neural network (FNN) is introduced to extract physical information from the denoised data.

The results indicate that when the frequency interval is less than 4 MHz, the temperature error is kept within ±0.11 °C, but is ±0.15 °C at 6 MHz. It takes less than 17 s to extract the temperature distribution from the FNN. Moreover, input vectors for the Brillouin gain spectrum with a frequency interval of no more than 6 MHZ are unified into 200 input elements by linear interpolation.

Two robust adaptive control techniques, indirect and direct, are proposed to deal with the impacts of quantization error and external disturbances. The proposed control schemes, in conjunction with quantizers, guarantee the global boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system, allowing the attitude tracking error to converge toward an ultimately bounded region.

Although images and videos employed in PME are two-dimensional arrays, PME only extracts phase information in a single direction at a time. Therefore, extracting two-directional motions at the same time is needed to avoid two times of PME implementation. To address this issue, Riesz-transform is integrated to the phase-based motion estimation algorithm, and Riesz transform PME (RPME) is proposed in this work. The concept of plane phase is extended to spatial phase using Riesz transform to process images, because Riesz transform is able to extract phase information in two directions simultaneously. Then quaternion is utilized to derive the theoretical relationship between spatial phase and structure motions. In order to obtain the mono-component image sequence required in Riesz transform, an ideal narrow bandpass filter is constructed based on the set of Butterworth low-pass filters. Due to the capability of recognizing two-directional motions simultaneously using the proposed RPME, a much-improved efficiency of structural dynamics identification is observed. In addition, Riesz transform extracts instantaneous phase, thus the motion recognition accuracy is improved as well. To validate the benefit of RPME, both numerical simulation and laboratory-scale experiments are conducted, and motions in x and y directions are extracted simultaneously, with a drastically increased accuracy in both the simulation and experimental validations.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60126393","afid":"60126393","affilname":"Key Laboratory of New Technology for Construction of Cities in Mountain Area, MOE","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023380","afid":"60023380","affilname":"Chongqing University","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011410","afid":"60011410","affilname":"Worcester Polytechnic Institute","affiliation-city":"Worcester","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216274645","authid":"57216274645","authname":"Li M.Z.","surname":"Li","given-name":"M.

It has the salient ability to represent high-dimensional data and extract features. On the other hand, in more recent years, the quaternion has proven to be a very suitable tool for color pixel representation as it can well preserve cross-channel correlation of color channels. Motivated by the advantages of the HOSVD and the quaternion tool, in this paper, we generalize the HOSVD to the quaternion domain and define quaternion-based HOSVD (QHOSVD). Due to the non-commutability of quaternion multiplication, QHOSVD is not a trivial extension of the HOSVD. They have similar but different calculation procedures. Theoretically, QHOSVD is a proper tensor generalization of the quaternion singular value decomposition (QSVD), and a proper quaternion generalization of the standard HOSVD. From the application point of view, the defined QHOSVD can be widely used in various visual data processing with color pixels. As examples, in this paper, we present two applications of the defined QHOSVD in color image processing—multi-focus color image fusion and color image denoising. The experimental results on the two applications respectively demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed methods over some existing ones.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60122420","afid":"60122420","affilname":"Shandong University of Finance and Economics","affiliation-city":"Jinan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028009","afid":"60028009","affilname":"Yunnan University","affiliation-city":"Kunming","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023237","afid":"60023237","affilname":"Beijing Normal University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201452670","authid":"57201452670","authname":"Miao J.","surname":"Miao","given-name":"Jifei","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028009"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003837546","authid":"7003837546","orcid":"0000-0003-1924-9087","authname":"Kou K.I.","surname":"Kou","given-name":"Kit Ian","initials":"K.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194324445","authid":"57194324445","authname":"Cheng D.","surname":"Cheng","given-name":"Dong","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023237"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57218182246","authid":"57218182246","authname":"Liu W.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Wankai","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122420"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image denoising | Multi-focus color image fusion | Quaternion higher-order singular value decomposition (QHOSVD) | Quaternion tensor","source-id":"26099","fund-acr":"UM","fund-no":"FDCT/0036/2021/AGJ","fund-sponsor":"Shanghai Science and Technology Development Foundation","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85143407282"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85143407282?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85143407282&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85143407282&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85143407282","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85143407282","eid":"2-s2.0-85143407282","dc:title":"Stop and go strategy for Lagrange stability of quaternion-valued memristive neural networks","dc:creator":"Li R.","prism:publicationName":"Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences","prism:issn":"01704214","prism:eIssn":"10991476","prism:volume":"46","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"6578-6589","prism:coverDate":"2023-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2023","prism:doi":"10.1002/mma.8926","dc:description":"This paper introduces a novel approach to study the quaternion-valued memristive neural networks and uses this method to investigate the Lagrange stability of the memristive system.

Firstly, color components are precoded into a trinion matrix, which is performed trinion discrete cosine transform. Then three parts of the transformed result are pairwisely combined into complex matrices and the synthesized spectrums satisfying symmetry are established. Followed by Josephus scrambling with variable steps on magnitudes, the ciphertext image can be acquired.

The existing semi-fragile watermarking methods have some problems, such as blurred localization shape and high false alarm rate, which stem from the rough analysis of tampering information. To address these problems, this paper proposes a semi-fragile watermarking tamper localization method based on quaternion discrete Fourier transform (QDFT) and multi-view fusion, which embeds two watermarks in the QDFT domain for robust resistance to the geometric attack and integrity protection of host image, respectively. On the receiver side, considering that the difference map in binary mode is difficult to identify tampering, the global information and local smoothing cues are used in the method, to obtain the multi-scale candidate maps with real values instead of binary. Then, local adaptive fusion is accomplished by minimizing the energy function, to obtain a more consistent single tampering map. The design of the energy function integrates the image content and multi-scale feature views. Finally, a tamper seed-based propagation strategy is designed to generate a binary map of the tampered regions.

The circle-based image moments are defined to construct image dynamics, and the passivity-like property of the circle features is preserved by reprojecting to the virtual image plane. The landing control system is decoupled into translation and rotation modules due to the rotation invariance of the proposed circle features. First, by exploiting the error transformation in the image space, a robust IBVS controller can overcome the lack of both the desired depth information of target features and the velocity feedback of the target. Next, an adaptive geometric attitude controller is developed directly using rotation matrices to avoid the singularities of Euler-Angles and the ambiguity of quaternions. One benefit of the proposed scheme is that it can potentially improve the camera visibility, guarantee the transient and steady-state behaviors in image space, and be efficiently implemented on the low-cost quadrotor. Finally, The stability analysis is presented using Lyapunov stability theory on cascaded systems, and the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated through simulations and experiments. Note to Practitioners-The motivation of this paper is to investigate a practical control strategy for the image-based landing control of underactuated quadrotors on an unpredictable moving vehicle. In most of the existing image-based landing control schemes for underactuated quadrotors, having the prior predictive model of the moving landing vehicle to provide a feed-forward compensation during the landing maneuver. However, due to the fact that the landing environment and vehicle are primarily stochastic, resulting in no predictive models are valid in practice. Therefore, this paper suggests a robust image-based landing control strategy without the model or state of the moving landing vehicle. In particular, a novel virtual circle feature, possessing the characteristic of rotation invariance, is designed for the landing of underactuated quadrotors, which decouples the landing system and simplifies the control design. Moreover, the image feature errors are directly retained within prescribed performance funnels in the image space. As a result, the transient and steady-state landing behaviors can be implicitly guaranteed in Cartesian space. The stability and convergence of the system are analyzed mathematically and the experiment using quadrotors provides promising results. In ongoing research, we are addressing the issues of collision avoidances and unknown disturbances to provide a more realistic setup for the autonomous deployment and recovery of underactuated quadrotors in GPS-denied environments.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60123533","afid":"60123533","affilname":"Key Laboratory of System Control and Information Processing, Ministry of Education","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033021","afid":"60033021","affilname":"The University of New Mexico","affiliation-city":"Albuquerque","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032356","afid":"60032356","affilname":"Hunan University","affiliation-city":"Changsha","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/117569332","afid":"117569332","affilname":"National Engineering Laboratory for Robot Visual Perception and Control Technology","affiliation-city":"Changsha","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57217016388","authid":"57217016388","orcid":"0000-0002-9111-9044","authname":"Lin J.","surname":"Lin","given-name":"Jie","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"117569332"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55998880600","authid":"55998880600","orcid":"0000-0002-0519-6458","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yaonan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"117569332"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54884605600","authid":"54884605600","orcid":"0000-0002-0899-1537","authname":"Miao Z.","surname":"Miao","given-name":"Zhiqiang","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"117569332"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56183152100","authid":"56183152100","orcid":"0000-0002-9959-1634","authname":"Wang H.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Hesheng","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60123533"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006028932","authid":"7006028932","orcid":"0000-0002-5574-7246","authname":"Fierro R.","surname":"Fierro","given-name":"Rafael","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033021"}]}],"authkeywords":"Automatic landing | image-based visual servoing | nonlinear control | quadrotor | unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","source-id":"17340","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85162154964"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85162154964?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85162154964&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85162154964&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85162154964","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85162154964","eid":"2-s2.0-85162154964","dc:title":"Adaptive Direct Fault-tolerant Control Design for Spacecraft Integrated Attitude and Orbit System","dc:creator":"Ma Y.J.","prism:publicationName":"Zidonghua Xuebao/Acta Automatica Sinica","prism:issn":"02544156","prism:volume":"49","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"678-686","prism:coverDate":"2023-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"March 2023","prism:doi":"10.16383/j.aas.c220501","dc:description":"This paper proposes an adaptive direct fault-tolerant control method for the tracking spacecraft with actuator faults during proximity operations, to ensure the stability and the asymptotic tracking performance of the target spacecraft.

Firstly, we proposed an improved SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features) algorithm and GPU-accelerated digital image processing scheme to detect and match the real-time features of two images acquired at different focal lengths. Secondly, geometric cross-ratio invariance was used to correct the position information of distorted feature points at image edges. Finally, we used the least square method to estimate the depth information of the target and combines the quaternion space model to determine the attitude information of the target to determine its position. Experimental results show that the improved SURF algorithm is superior to the classical SURF algorithm in feature matching accuracy and speed. If the corner characteristic position error is controlled within one pixel, the depth error is no more than 2% and the angle errors of azimuth, pitch and roll angles are less than 4°, 5° and 2°, respectively. This error meets the target positioning accuracy requirements of the airborne optronics pod. In addition, when processing a set of images (two frames) at 1080 P resolution, the processing time can be increased to 74 ms through GPU acceleration, which meets the real-time demand for data processing in the airborne optronics pod.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031449","afid":"60031449","affilname":"FAW Group Corporation","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004828","afid":"60004828","affilname":"Changchun Institute of Optics Fine Mechanics and Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58395600800","authid":"58395600800","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57213605311","authid":"57213605311","authname":"Li Y.F.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Yu Fang","initials":"Y.F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031449"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36922271100","authid":"36922271100","authname":"Ren H.","surname":"Ren","given-name":"Hang","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14021230000","authid":"14021230000","authname":"Han S.W.","surname":"Han","given-name":"Song Wei","initials":"S.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57210947028","authid":"57210947028","authname":"Liu L.G.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Li Gang","initials":"L.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58045430100","authid":"58045430100","authname":"Sun M.C.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Ming Chao","initials":"M.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55911146000","authid":"55911146000","authname":"Song C.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Ce","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"}]}],"authkeywords":"attitude | feature extraction | feature matching | targeting technology","source-id":"21100226804","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"20200403057SF","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85151194519"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85151194519?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85151194519&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85151194519&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85151194519","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85151194519","eid":"2-s2.0-85151194519","dc:title":"Adaptive Control for Gravitational Wave Detection Formation Considering Time-Varying Communication Delays","dc:creator":"Zhang Y.","prism:publicationName":"Sensors","prism:issn":"14248220","prism:volume":"23","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"March 2023","prism:doi":"10.3390/s23063003","dc:description":"A distributed six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) cooperative control for multiple spacecraft formation is investigated considering parametric uncertainties, external disturbances, and time-varying communication delays.

An adaptive coordinated control law is developed by combining the coordinated control algorithm with an adaptive algorithm to compensate for parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. The Lyapunov method is used to prove that the tracking errors converge globally asymptotically. Numerical simulations show that the proposed method can realize cooperative control of attitude and orbit for the multi-spacecraft formation.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021182","afid":"60021182","affilname":"Sun Yat-Sen University","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"36991713","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57220588382","authid":"57220588382","authname":"Zhang Y.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Yu","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021182"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57218856110","authid":"57218856110","orcid":"0000-0003-0701-6171","authname":"Liu Y.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Yuan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021182"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222363535","authid":"57222363535","authname":"Zhang J.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Juzheng","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021182"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57220593161","authid":"57220593161","authname":"Lu Z.","surname":"Lu","given-name":"Zhenkun","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021182"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57220588433","authid":"57220588433","authname":"Yang J.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Jikun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021182"}]}],"authkeywords":"adaptive control | communication delays | distributed coordinated control | dual quaternions","article-number":"3003","source-id":"130124","fund-acr":"NKRDPC","fund-no":"2019B030302001","fund-sponsor":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85151181658"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85151181658?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85151181658&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85151181658&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85151181658","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85151181658","eid":"2-s2.0-85151181658","dc:title":"Attitude-Orbit Coupled Control of Gravitational Wave Detection Spacecraft with Communication Delays","dc:creator":"Zhang Y.","prism:publicationName":"Sensors","prism:issn":"14248220","prism:volume":"23","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"March 2023","prism:doi":"10.3390/s23063233","dc:description":"In order to meet the position and attitude requirements of spacecrafts and test masses for gravitational-wave detection missions, the attitude-orbit coordination control of multiple spacecrafts and test masses is studied. A distributed coordination control law for spacecraft formation based on dual quaternion is proposed. By describing the relationship between spacecrafts and test masses in the desired states, the coordination control problem is converted into a consistent-tracking control problem in which each spacecraft or test mass tracks its desired states. An accurate attitude-orbit relative dynamics model of the spacecraft and the test masses is proposed based on dual quaternions. A cooperative feedback control law based on a consistency algorithm is designed to achieve the consistent attitude tracking of multiple rigid bodies (spacecraft and test mass) and maintain the specific formation configuration. Moreover, the communication delays of the system are taken into account. The distributed coordination control law ensures almost global asymptotic convergence of the relative position and attitude error in the presence of communication delays. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method, which meets the formation-configuration requirements for gravitational-wave detection missions.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021182","afid":"60021182","affilname":"Sun Yat-Sen University","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"36991943","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57220588382","authid":"57220588382","authname":"Zhang Y.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Yu","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021182"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57218856110","authid":"57218856110","authname":"Liu Y.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Yuan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021182"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57220588433","authid":"57220588433","authname":"Yang J.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Jikun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021182"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57220593161","authid":"57220593161","authname":"Lu Z.","surname":"Lu","given-name":"Zhenkun","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021182"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222363535","authid":"57222363535","authname":"Zhang J.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Juzheng","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021182"}]}],"authkeywords":"attitude-orbit coupled control | distributed coordination controller | dual quaternion | spacecraft formation","article-number":"3233","source-id":"130124","fund-acr":"NKRDPC","fund-no":"2019B030302001","fund-sponsor":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149942018"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149942018?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149942018&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149942018&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0016003223000431"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149942018","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85149942018","eid":"2-s2.0-85149942018","dc:title":"Internet of health things encryption via master-slave synchronization for stochastic quaternion-valued neural networks","dc:creator":"Ramesh Babu N.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of the Franklin Institute","prism:issn":"00160032","prism:volume":"360","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"3700-3749","prism:coverDate":"2023-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"March 2023","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jfranklin.2023.01.022","pii":"S0016003223000431","dc:description":"This paper investigates the problem of master-slave synchronization of stochastic quaternion-valued neural networks (SQVNNs) with mixed time-varying delays.

Sufficient conditions for synchronization of the proposed model are derived by constructing appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional by applying the master-slave synchronization method of master-slave and some integral inequality techniques. Finally, a corresponding numerical simulation is presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the theoretical results. This paper introduces a unique and efficient image encryption algorithm based on SQVNNs. This technique utilizes the solution set of SQVNNs to generate the high-level randomness secret keys to encrypt the source image. Finally, we conclude that the algorithm yields a source image cipher with excellent diffusion and confusion properties. A few test clinical images are utilized to show the validity of the proposed method.

Indices based on studies of cardiac vector dynamics have emerged. We use quaternions to quantify symmetry changes in cardiac vector velocity during ventricular repolarization, which could signal the arrhythmia risk. Principal component analysis is used to homogenize the information and reduce the space to three dimensions. A comparison with the ratio of normalized areas of the repolarization loop (T-wave) and two standard measurements was made: QT and T peak-end intervals. Assessment was conducted by comparing 52 healthy subjects with patients undergoing treatment with Sotalol: 7 recordings with Torsade de Pointes events and 15 without arrhythmic effects. Significant differences (p ¡ 5E-4) were found in both phases of repolarization in terms of absolute velocities and areas. The ratio between the maximums of each parameter in both halves of the T-wave showed a trend towards 1 in the proximity of an arrhythmic event. Angular velocity ratios reached a sensitivity/specificity pair of 100 (95%CI: 59–100)/90 (95%CI: 79–97) with an AUC of 98.6 (95%CI: 95.7–100) in the comparison of healthy population with at-risk patients. Linear discriminant analysis improved the classification by reaching sensitivity and specificity values of 100 (95%CI: 59–100) and 96 (5%CI: 87–100), respectively. The high performance of the method exceeded the diagnostic power of standard measurements, thus showing its potential to contribute to drug evaluation methods. Further research with a larger number of events is required to generalize the method.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60066463","afid":"60066463","affilname":"Instituto Argentino de Matematica","affiliation-city":"Buenos Aires","affiliation-country":"Argentina"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025730","afid":"60025730","affilname":"Universidad Autónoma de Guadalajara","affiliation-city":"Zapopan","affiliation-country":"Mexico"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008943","afid":"60008943","affilname":"Universidad de Guadalajara","affiliation-city":"Guadalajara","affiliation-country":"Mexico"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001563","afid":"60001563","affilname":"Universidad de Buenos Aires","affiliation-city":"Buenos Aires","affiliation-country":"Argentina"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56562887200","authid":"56562887200","authname":"Cruces P.D.","surname":"Cruces","given-name":"Pablo Daniel","initials":"P.D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001563"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60066463"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58023361000","authid":"58023361000","authname":"Toscano A.","surname":"Toscano","given-name":"Alejandra","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001563"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58023145000","authid":"58023145000","authname":"Rodríguez F.J.A.","surname":"Rodríguez","given-name":"Francisco Javier Alvarado","initials":"F.J.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025730"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008943"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23390171100","authid":"23390171100","authname":"Romo-Vázquez R.","surname":"Romo-Vázquez","given-name":"Rebeca","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008943"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602348313","authid":"6602348313","authname":"Arini P.D.","surname":"Arini","given-name":"Pedro David","initials":"P.D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001563"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60066463"}]}],"authkeywords":"Angular velocity | Quaternion | Torsade de Pointes | Vectorcardiogram","article-number":"104493","source-id":"4700152237","fund-acr":"CONICET","fund-no":"PICT 2145-2016","fund-sponsor":"Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85142480000"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85142480000?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85142480000&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85142480000&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1051200422004468"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85142480000","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85142480000","eid":"2-s2.0-85142480000","dc:title":"Image analysis with logarithmic Zernike moments[Formula presented]","dc:creator":"Lu X.","prism:publicationName":"Digital Signal Processing: A Review Journal","prism:issn":"10512004","prism:volume":"133","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"March 2023","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.dsp.2022.103829","pii":"S1051200422004468","dc:description":"As one of the most widely used orthogonal moments, Zernike moments (ZMs) have been applied in various fields. But low-order ZMs encounter problem for describing small size images. The cause of this problem lies in that zeros of ZMs' radial basis function (RBF) bias toward large radial distance from the origin. Fractional Zernike moments (FrZMs) can be utilized to deal with small size images by adjusting RBF's zeros distribution with fractional-order parameter. But high-order FrZMs will result in numerical instability. To address these problems, ZMs are generalized to transformed Zernike moments (TZMs) and logarithmic Zernike moments (LoZMs) are proposed. ZMs and FrZMs are only special cases of TZMs. LoZMs are constructed by a particularly designed transformed function such that zeros of LoZMs'RBF are near evenly distributed in interval [0,1]. As a result, small size images can be well represented with low-order LoZMs. Furthermore, amplitudes of LoZMs'RBF keep relatively stable and numerical instability of high-order moments is suppressed. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of LoZMs in image reconstruction and pattern recognition tasks. In addition, a quaternion-based zero-watermarking algorithm also shows that LoZMs perform better than ZMs.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143","afid":"60064143","affilname":"Nanjing University of Information Science &amp; Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000937","afid":"60000937","affilname":"Shenzhen University","affiliation-city":"Shenzhen","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57980178100","authid":"57980178100","authname":"Lu X.","surname":"Lu","given-name":"Xiaoqi","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35340308500","authid":"35340308500","authname":"Yang J.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Jianwei","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000937"}]}],"authkeywords":"Logarithmic Zernike moments | Orthogonal moments | Rotation invariant | Zernike moments","article-number":"103829","source-id":"24306","fund-acr":"NSF","fund-no":"42275160","fund-sponsor":"National Science Foundation","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
