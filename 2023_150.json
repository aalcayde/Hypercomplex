The proposed approach includes contrast enhancement on pre-processed images and performs cartoon-texture(CT) and quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) based decomposition to extract low frequency and high frequency components. The weights for these components are computed based on the image content. The CSGWO algorithm is used to optimize the fusion process for the low frequency and high frequency components separately. The optimized components are then combined using the computed weights to obtain the final fused image. The proposed method is evaluated using objective metrics such as fusion quality index, structural similarity index (SSIM) and mutual information (MI) and compared with other state-of-the-art image fusion techniques.

This makes it possible to improve the representation acquisition abilities of the networks. Hypercomplex-inspired networks, however, still incur higher computational costs than standard CNNs. This paper reduces this cost by decomposing a quaternion 2D convolutional module into two consecutive separable vectormap modules. In addition, we use 4 and 5D parameterized hypercomplex multiplication-based fully connected layers. Incorporating both yields our proposed hypercomplex CNN, a novel architecture that can be assembled to construct deep separable hypercomplex networks (SHNNs) for image classification. We conduct experiments on CIFAR, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet datasets and achieve better performance using fewer trainable parameters and FLOPS. Our proposed model achieves almost 2% higher performance for CIFAR and SVHN datasets and more than 3% for the ImageNet-Tiny dataset and takes 84%, 35%, and 51% fewer parameters than the ResNets, quaternion, and vectormap networks, respectively. Also, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR benchmarks in hypercomplex space.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015161","afid":"60015161","affilname":"University of Louisiana at Lafayette","affiliation-city":"Lafayette","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189220054","authid":"57189220054","authname":"Shahadat N.","surname":"Shahadat","given-name":"Nazmul","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015161"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004509377","authid":"7004509377","authname":"Maida A.S.","surname":"Maida","given-name":"Anthony S.","initials":"A.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015161"}]}],"authkeywords":"Hypercomplex networks | Quaternion CNNs | Separable Convolution | Separable hypercomplex networks | Vectormap CNNs","source-id":"21101090643","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85161360741"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85161360741?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85161360741&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85161360741&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85161360741","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85161360741","eid":"2-s2.0-85161360741","dc:title":"Embedding of Octonion Fourier Transform in Geometric Algebra of R and Polar Representations of Octonion Analytic Signals","dc:creator":"Hitzer E.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783031309229"}],"prism:volume":"13862 LNCS","prism:pageRange":"123-134","prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-30923-6_10","dc:description":"We show how the octonion Fourier transform can be embedded and studied in Clifford geometric algebra of three-dimensional Euclidean space Cl(3, 0).

Considering acoustic vector sensors (AVSs) commonly used in underwater applications, this article proposes a novel algorithm, called augmented nested quaternion-multiple signal classification (ANQ-MUSIC), to perform DOA estimation. By judiciously arranging the multicomponent outputs of AVSs, we model the received signals from the entire nested AVS array (NAA) as a quaternion observation vector in a compact way to reduce computational complexity. Next, we formulate a quaternion-based difference co-array (QDCA) model via vectorizing the quaternion covariance matrix (QCM). Based on the obtained insights from the QDCA model, we derive a suitable QCM, which is constructed by applying the spatial smoothing (SS) technique. Finally, classical quaternion-MUSIC (Q-MUSIC) is logically introduced to estimate the DOA parameters. In simulations, we take into account nonuniform received noise and intercomponent correlated (ICC) noise, which may occur in practical underwater environments. The results demonstrate that the proposed method shows superiority in angular resolution and achieves a desirable tradeoff between estimate accuracy and computational burden, besides showing robust performance in the above test scenarios.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012967","afid":"60012967","affilname":"University of British Columbia Okanagan","affiliation-city":"Kelowna","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003977","afid":"60003977","affilname":"Northwestern Polytechnical University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003353","afid":"60003353","affilname":"Harbin Engineering University","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56479928200","authid":"56479928200","orcid":"0000-0002-4512-781X","authname":"Lou Y.","surname":"Lou","given-name":"Yi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003353"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57226578756","authid":"57226578756","orcid":"0000-0001-9393-925X","authname":"Qu X.","surname":"Qu","given-name":"Xinghao","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003353"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57212084780","authid":"57212084780","orcid":"0000-0001-9981-3623","authname":"Wang D.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Dawei","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55717581700","authid":"55717581700","orcid":"0000-0001-6310-8236","authname":"Cheng J.","surname":"Cheng","given-name":"Julian","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012967"}]}],"authkeywords":"Acoustic vector sensors (AVSs) | direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation | nested arrays | quaternion theory | subspace-based methods","article-number":"4204714","source-id":"17360","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85161183359"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85161183359?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85161183359&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85161183359&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85161183359","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85161183359","eid":"2-s2.0-85161183359","dc:title":"Color image steganalysis based on quaternion discrete cosine transform","dc:creator":"Xu M.","prism:publicationName":"Electronic Research Archive","prism:eIssn":"26881594","prism:volume":"31","prism:issueIdentifier":"7","prism:pageRange":"4102-4118","prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.3934/era.2023209","dc:description":"With the rapid development and application of Internet technology in recent years, the issue of information security has received more and more attention. Digital steganography is used as a means of secure communication to hide information by modifying the carrier. However, steganography can also be used for illegal acts, so it is of great significance to study steganalysis techniques. The steganalysis technology can be used to solve the illegal steganography problem of computer vision and engineering applications technology. Most of the images in the Internet are color images, and steganalysis for color images is a very critical problem in the field of steganalysis at this stage. Currently proposed algorithms for steganalysis of color images mainly rely on the manual design of steganographic features, and the steganographic features do not fully consider the internal connection between the three channels of color images. In recent years, advanced steganography techniques for color images have been proposed, which brings more serious challenges to color image steganalysis. Quaternions are a good tool to represent color images, and the transformation of quaternions can fully exploit the correlation among color image channels. In this paper, we propose a color image steganalysis algorithm based on quaternion discrete cosine transform, firstly, the image is represented by quaternion, then the quaternion discrete cosine transform is applied to it, and the coefficients obtained from the transformation are extracted to design features of the coeval matrix. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm works better than the typical color image steganalysis algorithm.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143","afid":"60064143","affilname":"Nanjing University of Information Science &amp; Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010080","afid":"60010080","affilname":"Nanjing University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/129575299","afid":"129575299","affilname":"State Key Laboratory of Mathematical Engineering and Advanced Computing","affiliation-city":"Zhenghzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58445138300","authid":"58445138300","authname":"Xu M.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Meng","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"129575299"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8976166200","authid":"8976166200","authname":"Luo X.","surname":"Luo","given-name":"Xiangyang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"129575299"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219116697","authid":"57219116697","authname":"Wang J.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Jinwei","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57218554050","authid":"57218554050","authname":"Wang H.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Hao","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010080"}]}],"authkeywords":"quaternion | steganalysis | steganography","source-id":"21101066573","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"62172435","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85161032360"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85161032360?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85161032360&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85161032360&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85161032360","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85161032360","eid":"2-s2.0-85161032360","dc:title":"The Lorentz Group Using Conformal Geometric Algebra and Split Quaternions for Color Image Processing: Theory and Practice","dc:creator":"Bayro-Corrochano E.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Access","prism:eIssn":"21693536","prism:volume":"11","prism:pageRange":"56785-56800","prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3279765","dc:description":"The processing of color images is of great interest, because the human perception of color is a very complex process, still not well understood. In this article, firstly the authors present an analysis of the well-known mathematical methods used to model color as a phenomenon and to process color images. We propose an adequate metric to process color images using the Minkowski or space-time metric. We propose that the processing of HSV images can be done using the HSV cone in the quaternion split algebra or the conformal geometric algebra frameworks. We show that the processing of RGB images using the Euclidean metric in the R3 doesn't yield good results. The colors of images change by daylight, we understand this phenomenon as the color change follows the action of the Lorentz Lie group. Consequently, we formulate a new model for representing and processing color using split quaternions and space-time conformal geometric algebra. We propose new algorithms for practical color image processing: we formulate the novel Split Quaternion Fourier Transform for color image processing and we interpolate color images using Split Motors which belong to the space-time conformal geometric algebra. The experimental part proves that real color images have to be processed in the HSV cone. We show successful applications of the Quaternion Split Fourier Transform and the interpolation processing. We compare these computations using the RGB metric in the R3 space and using the Minkowski metric in the HSV cone. This comparison shows clearly that the color image processing using the Minkowski metric in the HSV cone performs better.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018216","afid":"60018216","affilname":"CINVESTAV Unidad Guadalajara","affiliation-city":"Guadalajara","affiliation-country":"Mexico"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55995861000","authid":"55995861000","orcid":"0000-0002-4738-3593","authname":"Bayro-Corrochano E.","surname":"Bayro-Corrochano","given-name":"Eduardo","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018216"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35293940200","authid":"35293940200","authname":"Vazquez-Flores Z.","surname":"Vazquez-Flores","given-name":"Zuleima","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018216"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57954665600","authid":"57954665600","orcid":"0000-0001-9905-6060","authname":"Uriostegui-Legorreta U.","surname":"Uriostegui-Legorreta","given-name":"Ulises","initials":"U.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018216"}]}],"authkeywords":"and Value (HSV) | color image processing | conformal geometric algebra | Hue | interpolation | Lorentz group transformation | Quaternion Split Fourier Transform (QSFT) | Red Green Blue (RGB) | Saturation | split quaternions","source-id":"21100374601","fund-no":"A1-S-10412","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85160756355"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85160756355?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85160756355&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85160756355&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85160756355","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85160756355","eid":"2-s2.0-85160756355","dc:title":"Saturation-Value Blind Color Image Deblurring with Geometric Spatial-Feature Prior","dc:creator":"Zhang H.","prism:publicationName":"Communications in Computational Physics","prism:issn":"18152406","prism:eIssn":"19917120","prism:volume":"33","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"795-823","prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.4208/cicp.OA-2022-0226","dc:description":"Blind deblurring for color images has long been a challenging computer vision task. The intrinsic color structures within image channels have typically been disregarded in many excellent works. We investigate employing regularizations in the hue, saturation, and value (HSV) color space via the quaternion framework in order to better retain the internal relationship among the multiple channels and reduce color distortions and color artifacts. We observe that a geometric spatial-feature prior utilized in the intermediate latent image successfully enhances the kernel accuracy for the blind deblurring variational models, preserving the salient edges while decreasing the unfavorable structures. Motivated by this, we develop a saturation-value geometric spatial-feature prior in the HSV color space via the quaternion framework for blind color image deblurring, which facilitates blur kernel estimation. An alternating optimization strategy combined with a primal-dual projected gradient method can effectively solve this novel proposed model. Extensive experimental results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in blind color image deblurring by a wide margin, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013614","afid":"60013614","affilname":"Hangzhou Dianzi University","affiliation-city":"Hangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010719","afid":"60010719","affilname":"National Heart and Lung Institute","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002798","afid":"60002798","affilname":"Chinese University of Hong Kong","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57561821400","authid":"57561821400","authname":"Zhang H.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Hao","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002798"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204847825","authid":"57204847825","authname":"Fang Y.","surname":"Fang","given-name":"Yingying","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010719"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219751888","authid":"57219751888","authname":"Wong H.S.","surname":"Wong","given-name":"Hok Shing","initials":"H.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002798"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7501447027","authid":"7501447027","authname":"Li L.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Lihua","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013614"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25423412800","authid":"25423412800","authname":"Zeng T.","surname":"Zeng","given-name":"Tieyong","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002798"}]}],"authkeywords":"Blind color image deblurring | color space | geometric spatial-feature prior | quaternion","source-id":"10600153306","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"14301121","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85160277583"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85160277583?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85160277583&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85160277583&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85160277583","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85160277583","eid":"2-s2.0-85160277583","dc:title":"New Blind Image Moments Watermarking Method Based on Evolutionary Optimization of Embedding Parameters","dc:creator":"Chekira C.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Access","prism:eIssn":"21693536","prism:volume":"11","prism:pageRange":"48517-48547","prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3276576","dc:description":"In image watermarking, the locations where the watermark is embedded in the frequency domain and the embedding strength influence the overall performance of the blind watermarking procedure.

The performances under different attack conditions are evaluated, and a comparative study is established with other conventional selection methods and other discrete transforms.

These conditions introduce artifacts that make visual analysis challenging and limit the performance of high-level computer vision methods. In time-critical applications, it is vital to develop algorithms that automatically remove rain without compromising the quality of the image contents. This article proposes a novel approach called QSAM-Net, a quaternion multi-stage multiscale neural network with a self-attention module. The algorithm requires significantly fewer parameters by a factor of 3.98 than the real-valued counterpart and state-of-the-art methods while improving the visual quality of the images. The extensive evaluation and benchmarking on synthetic and real-world rainy images demonstrate the effectiveness of QSAM-Net.

Copy-move is one of the most commonly used types of forgery. The keypoint-based copy-move forgery detection (CMFD) techniques identify forged regions by extracting image keypoints and using local visual features. These methods show remarkable detection capability in some areas, such as memory requirements and computational cost. After years of research, the challenges of the current keypoint-based methods are as follows: 1) The number or distribution of extracted keypoints is not satisfactory, especially in smoothed and textured areas. 2) Many local visual features have poor robustness to geometric attacks and post-processing disturbances, which fundamentally limits the performance of algorithms. 3) The existing post-processing algorithms can’t effectively filter out false matched pairs and accurately locate the tampered areas. To overcome these problems, an accurate and robust image copy-move forgery detection method using adaptive keypoints and hybrid features is proposed. Firstly, an adaptive keypoint extraction method based on the simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) and the K-multiple-means (KMM) is proposed, which can extract the dense and uniform keypoints in the whole image. Then, we combine the transform domain features based on the Fast Quaternion Generic Polar Complex Exponential Transform (FQGPCET) and the texture features based on the Gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) to obtain the robust hybrid features. The hybrid features have outstanding descriptive power. Then the feature matching is performed by the double-bit quantized locally sensitive hash (DBQ-LSH). Finally, a high-precision post-processing algorithm includes two-step filtering and two-step clustering is proposed. The experimental results demonstrate that the overall performance of the proposed algorithm is superior to that of other solutions for detecting copy-move forgery images.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017010","afid":"60017010","affilname":"Liaoning Normal University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972239800","authid":"34972239800","authname":"Wang X.y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiang yang","initials":"X.y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58249541400","authid":"58249541400","authname":"Wang X.q.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xing qi","initials":"X.q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16205443400","authid":"16205443400","authname":"Niu P.p.","surname":"Niu","given-name":"Pan pan","initials":"P.p.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972350300","authid":"34972350300","authname":"Yang H.y.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Hong ying","initials":"H.y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive keypoints | CMFD | DBQ-LSH | FQGPCET | Robust hybrid feature | Two-step filtering and clustering","source-id":"25627","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61472171","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85158150027"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85158150027?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85158150027&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85158150027&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85158150027","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85158150027","eid":"2-s2.0-85158150027","dc:title":"Optimized quaternion radial Hahn Moments application to deep learning for the classification of diabetic retinopathy","dc:creator":"Tahiri M.A.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","prism:issn":"13807501","prism:eIssn":"15737721","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11042-023-15582-9","dc:description":"This paper proposes a new hybrid method of classification of fundus images provided by the Asia–Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society via combining the discrete moment quaternion approach, the artificial intelligence approach, and machine learning in order to automatically distinguish the stage of diabetic retinopathy using reduced databases divided into five classes. The proposed method is based on two main phases: the preprocessing phase, in which using the new radial invariant moments of Hahn in a quaternion optimized by the ant colony algorithm, in order to calculate the original n × n image moments. The second phase is devoted to introducing the calculated moments into the proposed convolutional neural network model. The present work will contribute to creating new neural network architectures that take advantage of Hahn's new 2D radial moment descriptive capability in quaternions. The K-fold cross-validation method is used to measure the proposed model's performance. Finally, graphical measures such as receiver operating characteristic and precision-rapple curves plus a confusion matrix are presented. Furthermore, numerical measures are adopted for f1-score, loss and precision. In 1795 images, the AUC yielded 94.58%, 97.02%, 94.87%, 97.83%, and 96.54% for the five classes of healthy, mild, moderate, severe, and proliferative respectively.

Quaternion-based models are desirable, because they do not have singularities, but their multiple equilibrium points make it difficult to develop a globally stable controller. In particular, discontinuous controllers can suffer from sensitivity to measurement noise in the case of maneuvers close to 180 ∘ . Additionally, dynamic models are in general subject to a limited knowledge of the parameters involved. In order to deal with the aforementioned issues, the control strategy proposed in this study creates a hybrid sliding surface that avoids unwinding and is robust against measurement errors. Using this sliding surface, a control law is established to stabilize the closed loop, then an adaptive law is added to deal with the unknown inertia uncertainty and disturbances. In the numerical simulation, the performance of the proposed hybrid controller is compared to the discontinuous SMC that is being widely used currently. A detailed analysis of the results reveals that the hybrid approach is robust against external disturbances and parameters uncertainty. Moreover, when measurement noise is added in case of large maneuvers the hybrid adaptive SMC converges faster, and can save up to 3.5 times in energy consumption, making it more efficient than its discontinuous counterpart.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019337","afid":"60019337","affilname":"Mohammed V University in Rabat","affiliation-city":"Rabat","affiliation-country":"Morocco"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011371","afid":"60011371","affilname":"Ecole Mohammadia d'Ingenieurs, Mohammed V University in Rabat","affiliation-city":"Rabat","affiliation-country":"Morocco"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/129565401","afid":"129565401","affilname":"University Center for Research in Space Technologies","affiliation-city":"Rabat","affiliation-country":"Morocco"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/129565379","afid":"129565379","affilname":"Royal Center for Space Research and Studies","affiliation-city":"Rabat","affiliation-country":"Morocco"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58093904200","authid":"58093904200","orcid":"0000-0003-1346-1538","authname":"El wafi I.","surname":"El wafi","given-name":"Ilyas","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011371"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"129565401"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019337"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9335784200","authid":"9335784200","authname":"Haloua M.","surname":"Haloua","given-name":"Mohamed","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011371"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019337"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57571270000","authid":"57571270000","authname":"Guennoun Z.","surname":"Guennoun","given-name":"Zouhair","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011371"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"129565401"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019337"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58203329600","authid":"58203329600","authname":"Moudden Z.","surname":"Moudden","given-name":"Zakaria","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"129565379"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude control | Hybrid | Nadir pointing | Nanosatellite | Sliding mode | Unwinding","source-id":"19700170911","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85153849512"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85153849512?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85153849512&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85153849512&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85153849512","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85153849512","eid":"2-s2.0-85153849512","dc:title":"Tangent Space Approximation in Geometric Statistics","dc:creator":"Chang T.","prism:publicationName":"Springer Handbooks","prism:issn":"25228692","prism:eIssn":"25228706","prism:pageRange":"1059-1073","prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-1-4471-7503-2_53","dc:description":"The Procrustes regression model provides a statistical framework to assess the errors in image registration (in arbitrary dimensions) from “landmark” data. The same mathematics can be used to determine the errors in calculated motions of rigid bodies in Euclidean space. Perhaps the scientifically most compelling example of rigid body motion is tectonic plates. Tectonic plates, to a first approximation, move as rigid bodies on the surface of the Earth. The estimation of the past configuration of the tectonic plates, and the errors in these reconstructions, is integral to the understanding of the past history of the Earth. Because tectonic plates are restricted to the surface of the Earth, the Procrustes regression model does not apply and the relevant model is called spherical regression. The Procrustes and spherical regression models are mathematically simple and, because of this simplicity, beautiful theorems about the properties of their estimates can be proven. The previous chapter (Chang T, Image registration, rigid bodies, and unknown coordinate systems. In: Pham H (ed) Springer handbook of engineering statistics, Springer-Verlag, London, pp. 571–590, 2006) discusses many of these results. Using the spherical regression model, interesting insights into the properties of tectonic plate reconstructions are discussed in (Chang, J Geophys Res 92(B7):6319–6329, 1987; Chang, Int Stat Rev 61:299–316, 1993). We will not replicate these results here. Rather the focus of this chapter is the underlying mathematics used to establish the results. These problems are intrinsically geometric and the proper use of geometry is important to their understanding. We will explain these points. This chapter is motivated by a request from a geophysics friend to explain, in as elementary fashion as feasible, the mathematics behind his work. This chapter will not replicate the formal proofs that appear elsewhere (see, for example, Chang, Ann Stat 14(3):907–924, 1986, Rivest, Ann Stat 17(1):307–317, 1989, or Chang and Ko, Ann Stat 23(5):1823–1847, 1995). This chapter is aimed at the scientist who wants to understand on a heuristic level why the results are true, without reading mathematically complete proofs! The type of data that is actually used to estimate plate reconstructions (experimentally determined “marine magnetic anomaly lineation” locations) is not of the form that is modeled in the spherical regression model. We discuss in Sect. 53.6 the type of data that is actually collected and how to analyze it using the mathematical principles we will discuss here. For the nongeophysicist, this section can be used as an example of the use of the mathematical principles of this chapter in a different and complex data setting. Furthermore, although the rigid plate hypothesis is a simplification, one must first understand what types of reconstruction errors are consistent with rigid plates before deciding if the errors one is observing are in fact evidence of nonrigidity. Section 53.6 discusses some work of this type. Essentially, this chapter is a case study in the use of tangent space approximations and some elementary ideas from differential geometry. Other authors have used similar geometrical approaches. For example, Rivest (J Biomech 38:1604–1611, 2005) and Oualkacha and Rivest (Biometrika 99:585–598, 2012) developed statistical methods for human motion studies derived from sensors placed on the human body as it moves. Chang and Rivest (Ann Stat 29(3):784–814, 2001) extended to Stiefel manifolds the work outlined here and in (Chang T, Image registration, rigid bodies, and unknown coordinate systems. In: Pham H (ed) Springer handbook of engineering statistics, Springer-Verlag, London, pp. 571–590, 2006) and used the results to reanalyze a data set on vector cardiograms. Patrangenaru has numerous papers (e.g., Mardia and Patrangenaru (Ann Stat 33(4):1666–1699, 2005)) developing statistical methods for comparing images when projective, rather than rigid, transformations are allowed. Indeed, the author believes that the engineering disciplines have multiple problems of a geometric nature and hopes that the approaches used here can be helpful in studying them. This chapter has been written so that it can be read independently of the preceding chapter (Chang T, Image registration, rigid bodies, and unknown coordinate systems. In: Pham H (ed) Springer handbook of engineering statistics, Springer-Verlag, London, pp. 571–590, 2006).","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021918","afid":"60021918","affilname":"University of Virginia","affiliation-city":"Charlottesville","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"ch","subtypeDescription":"Book Chapter","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404725033","authid":"7404725033","authname":"Chang T.","surname":"Chang","given-name":"Ted","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021918"}]}],"authkeywords":"Cayley-Klein parameters | Geometric statistics | Procrustes regression | Quaternions | Rigid body motion | Spherical regression | Tangent space approximation | Tectonic plate reconstruction","source-id":"21100936616","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85153775565"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85153775565?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85153775565&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85153775565&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85153775565","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85153775565","eid":"2-s2.0-85153775565","dc:title":"Quaternion Linear Canonical Curvelet Transform","dc:creator":"Khan A.A.","prism:publicationName":"Palestine Journal of Mathematics","prism:eIssn":"22195688","prism:volume":"12","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"645-660","prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","dc:description":"In this paper, we generalize linear canonical curvelet transform to quaternion valued signals, known as quaternion linear canonical curvelet transform (QLCCT).

This article divides the error sources of RSS ranging into three parts and deals with them in different methods. First, considering the influence of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) pose on RSS, the compensation model is established through Gaussian process regression (GPR) for the first time by mapping the quaternion of the UAV and the attenuation caused by the influence of anisotropy on the antenna in the corresponding special orthogonal group SO(3). On this basis, the distribution of random compensation variables is derived by unscented transformation (UT) and covariance propagation. Besides, a polynomial function is employed for fitting the distance-dependent environment noise. Then, to deal with the RSS measurement instability caused by the environment noise and the uncertainty of compensation, the adaptive Kalman filter (AKF) is introduced. Finally, an UWB-based environmental adaptive algorithm (UEAA) is proposed to improve ranging precision by using the UWB device in a dynamic environment. By setting the threshold parameter, the UEAA enables the classic RSS ranging model to have a certain adaptive ability for the dynamic environment of UAV, which significantly reduces the error caused by model parameter mismatch. Several experiments are carried out on the UAV platform, and the results show that the improvement of the RSS propagation model is adequate.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202036338","authid":"57202036338","orcid":"0000-0002-1270-2283","authname":"Tian J.","surname":"Tian","given-name":"Junxi","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56303970200","authid":"56303970200","orcid":"0000-0002-5231-5093","authname":"Yang M.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Ming","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58075268100","authid":"58075268100","orcid":"0000-0003-0323-6775","authname":"Li X.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Xiaonan","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57573936200","authid":"57573936200","orcid":"0000-0003-2241-6325","authname":"Zou S.","surname":"Zou","given-name":"Shiming","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/37002444800","authid":"37002444800","orcid":"0000-0003-0182-0345","authname":"Chao T.","surname":"Chao","given-name":"Tao","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]}],"authkeywords":"Environment-adaptive | Gaussian process regression (GPR) | received signal strength (RSS) | time of arrival (TOA) | unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms","article-number":"9506113","source-id":"15361","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85153337154"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85153337154?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85153337154&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85153337154&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85153337154","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85153337154","eid":"2-s2.0-85153337154","dc:title":"Measurement Method and Experiment of Hydraulic Support Group Attitude and Straightness Based on Binocular Vision","dc:creator":"Zeng Q.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","prism:issn":"00189456","prism:eIssn":"15579662","prism:volume":"72","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1109/TIM.2023.3267344","dc:description":"Hydraulic supports are important equipment used in coal mining.

First, a combination of binocular vision positioning and a convolutional neural network (CNN) object detection is used to achieve the 3-D location of mark points. Then, the attitude calculation model of the hydraulic support based on the dual quaternion method is established. This method achieves the space attitude detection between multiple hydraulic supports and the straightness detection of the hydraulic support group in 3-D space. In the laboratory environment, the position and attitude detection test of the hydraulic support is obtained through the working face equipment position detection test bench.

world is Melanoma is one the most dangerous form of skin cancer, but it has a higher survival rate if it is detected early. Presently Neural networks field has seen significant development in the research with the growth of deep and conventional neural networks usage in most applications. For multi-dimensional data, neural network models with hyper complex parameters archive better results when compared to real-valued models. This paper investigates the quaternion-valued neural network for melanoma cancer detection of pattern recognition tasks. Moreover, it achieved improved results than the real-valued network models. In the proposed model, for experiments, we are taken publicly available challenge dataset ISIC 2020 to train and test the clinical images with convolution neural network along with four-dimensional quaternion values. Experimental findings show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approach regarding diagnostic accuracy compared with prior real-valued neural networks on the same dataset.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60094091","afid":"60094091","affilname":"Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Hyderabad","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015465","afid":"60015465","affilname":"Defence Research and Development Organisation India","affiliation-city":"New Delhi","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/128564970","afid":"128564970","affilname":"Abhinav-Hitech College of Engineering","affiliation-city":"Moinabad","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57983247700","authid":"57983247700","authname":"Salvadi S.R.","surname":"Salvadi","given-name":"Shoba Rani","initials":"S.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60094091"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58184557500","authid":"58184557500","authname":"Rao D.N.","surname":"Rao","given-name":"D.

Two different control laws are separately developed and combined. First, based on a nominal attitude dynamic model assuming no uncertainty, the first controller is developed that exactly tracks a prespecified attitude reference trajectory with minimized control cost. The designer can generate this reference to prescribe desired performance specifications such as the maximum convergence time and overshoot. Next, an uncertain attitude dynamic system is considered, and the second controller is designed and added so that the controlled system can successfully track the predesigned reference trajectory with a user-specified tolerance even subject to uncertainty whose bounds are unknown. Compared to existing adaptive control schemes, the proposed approach possesses a very simple structure with a small number of control parameters and is not computationally intensive, making it more attractive for practical implementation. The proposed control laws generate smooth control signals and any information about the uncertainty bound is not needed in its design. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the practical feasibility of the proposed approach, where reorientation/slew maneuvers of a large spacecraft are considered. The effects of limitations on the control torques are also investigated to show the effectiveness of the control methodology developed herein.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028872","afid":"60028872","affilname":"Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University","affiliation-city":"Daytona Beach","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25931966700","authid":"25931966700","orcid":"0000-0002-3245-0757","authname":"Cho H.","surname":"Cho","given-name":"Hancheol","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028872"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude control | fundamental equation of constrained motion | Lyapunov stability | sliding mode control | uncertainty","source-id":"21100374601","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85151165303"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85151165303?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85151165303&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85151165303&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85151165303","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85151165303","eid":"2-s2.0-85151165303","dc:title":"Vision Based Relative State and Inertia Knowledge Estimation of Un-cooperative Targets","dc:creator":"Feng Q.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering","prism:issn":"18761100","prism:eIssn":"18761119","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789811966125"}],"prism:volume":"845 LNEE","prism:pageRange":"7291-7301","prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-981-19-6613-2_704","dc:description":"This paper proposes an algorithm to estimate the relative state and inertia knowledge based on the geometrical frame measurement. The relative pose of the geometrical frame relative to its body frame is introduced as a component of the state. The inertial ratios are parameterized as independent random variables without constraints by using the inverse hyperbolic tangent function. Using the measurements of the quaternion and translational vector of the geometrical frame, with the novel inertia parameter method, the relative state, inertial parameters, and pose of the geometrical frame are estimated by a designed extended Kalman filter. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/129416990","afid":"129416990","affilname":"Space System Department Equipment Department","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/109458625","afid":"109458625","affilname":"Nanjing Research Institute of Electronics Engineering","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56949725500","authid":"56949725500","authname":"Feng Q.","surname":"Feng","given-name":"Qian","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"109458625"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221908053","authid":"57221908053","authname":"Sun J.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Junruo","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"109458625"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58162573200","authid":"58162573200","authname":"Wang L.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Lu","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"129416990"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58162434600","authid":"58162434600","authname":"Ma K.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Kang","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"109458625"}]}],"authkeywords":"Inertia ratio | Relative state | Stereoscopic vision","source-id":"19700186822","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85150521751"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85150521751?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85150521751&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85150521751&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85150521751","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85150521751","eid":"2-s2.0-85150521751","dc:title":"Donoho-Stark’s and Hardy’s uncertainty principles for the short-time quaternion offset linear canonical transform","dc:creator":"Dar A.H.","prism:publicationName":"Filomat","prism:issn":"03545180","prism:eIssn":"24060933","prism:volume":"37","prism:issueIdentifier":"14","prism:pageRange":"4467-4480","prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.2298/FIL2314467D","dc:description":"The quaternion offset linear canonical transform (QOLCT) which is time-shifted and frequency-modulated version of the quaternion linear canonical transform (QLCT) provides a more general framework of most existing signal processing tools.
