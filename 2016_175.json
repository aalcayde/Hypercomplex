Eliminating those unwanted values of the MEMS sensors signals enables recording actual accelerations affecting an object. Only a signal transformed in this way can be used in order to estimate the object location or construct the inertial navigation systems. The theoretical part of the work presents methods of the orientation representation with the use of Euler angles and quaternions. An algorithm of quaternion formation with the use of the rotation angles and a direct method using the accelerometer measurement data in the vector form are also presented here. The theoretical description of three algorithms of the gravitational acceleration components elimination, in which the universal method used at the changeable object orientation in movement and methods used at constant orientation, are described. One of the presented algorithms exploited the global gravity vector transformation into a local system with the use of the Direct Cosine Matrix and quaternions. Other described algorithms were based on eliminating the constant value by applying a digital filter and appropriate algebraic transformations.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002096","afid":"60002096","affilname":"Bialystok University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Bialystok","affiliation-country":"Poland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56519542800","authid":"56519542800","authname":"Sawicki A.","surname":"Sawicki","given-name":"Aleksander","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002096"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15077586300","authid":"15077586300","authname":"Walendziuk W.","surname":"Walendziuk","given-name":"Wojciech","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002096"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8862767300","authid":"8862767300","authname":"Idzkowski A.","surname":"Idzkowski","given-name":"Adam","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002096"}]}],"authkeywords":"accelerometer | gravity compensation | inertial sensors | MEMS sensors | quaternion","article-number":"100311U","source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992525868"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992525868?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84992525868&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84992525868&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992525868","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84992525868","eid":"2-s2.0-84992525868","dc:title":"7th International Workshop on Machine Learning in Medical Imaging, MLMI 2016 held in conjunction with 19th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention, MICCAI 2016","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783319471563"}],"prism:volume":"10019 LNCS","prism:pageRange":"1-323","prism:coverDate":"2016-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2016","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 38 papers.

The principal component analysis network (PCANet) offers a new unsupervised feature learning algorithm for images via a simple deep network architecture. However, PCA is sensitive to noise and outliers, which may depress the representation learning of PCANet. Grassmann averages (GA) is a newly proposed dimensionality reduction algorithm, which is more robust and effective than PCA. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a GA network (GANet) algorithm to improve the robustness of learned features from images. Moreover, since quaternion algebra provides a mathematically elegant tool to well handle color images, a quaternion representation based GANet (QGANet) is developed to fuse color information and learn a superior representation for color histopathological images. The experimental results on two histopathological image datasets show that GANet outperforms PCANet, while QGANet achieves the best performance for the classification of color histopathological images.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023813","afid":"60023813","affilname":"Shanghai University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000937","afid":"60000937","affilname":"Shenzhen University","affiliation-city":"Shenzhen","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191708953","authid":"57191708953","authname":"Wu J.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Jinjie","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404495816","authid":"7404495816","authname":"Shi J.","surname":"Shi","given-name":"Jun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24451523300","authid":"24451523300","authname":"Ying S.","surname":"Ying","given-name":"Shihui","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56841055400","authid":"56841055400","authname":"Zhang Q.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Qi","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55900053900","authid":"55900053900","authname":"Li Y.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Yan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000937"}]}],"source-id":"25674","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"11471208","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84991490620"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84991490620?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84991490620&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84991490620&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84991490620","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84991490620","eid":"2-s2.0-84991490620","dc:title":"2D hexagonal quaternion Fourier transform in color image processing","dc:creator":"Grigoryan A.M.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","prism:issn":"0277786X","prism:eIssn":"1996756X","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781510601109"}],"prism:volume":"9869","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2016-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2016","prism:doi":"10.1117/12.2223115","dc:description":"In this paper, we present a novel concept of the quaternion discrete Fourier transform on the two-dimensional hexagonal lattice, which we call the two-dimensional hexagonal quaternion discrete Fourier transform (2-D HQDFT).

Then the algorithms of sound source localization was studied in depth, the generalized cross-correlation(GCC) based time delay estimation(TDE) was presented. Finally the coordinates of sound source location was obtained in the quaternion microphone array model. The experiment results show that in the industrial environment, the error value of positioning accuracy is less than 4cm within an appropriate distance, it can meet the needs of practical application, meanwhile the reliability and the real-time performance is satisfactory.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032389","afid":"60032389","affilname":"Hebei University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tianjin","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/117453978","afid":"117453978","affilname":"School of Mechanical Engineering, Jiujiang Vocational and Technology College","affiliation-city":null,"affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191190347","authid":"57191190347","authname":"Zhang L.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Liang","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032389"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"117453978"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55728930300","authid":"55728930300","authname":"Li T.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Tiejun","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032389"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191377614","authid":"57191377614","authname":"Zong Y.","surname":"Zong","given-name":"Yinxue","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032389"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55512128200","authid":"55512128200","authname":"Tan Y.","surname":"Tan","given-name":"Yang","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032389"}]}],"authkeywords":"Butterworth wavelet | Fault diagnosis | Generalized cross-correlation | Sound source localization | Time delay estimation","source-id":"21100197523","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84989278733"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84989278733?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84989278733&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84989278733&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84989278733","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84989278733","eid":"2-s2.0-84989278733","dc:title":"Novel edge detection scheme in the trinion space for use in medical images with multiple components","dc:creator":"Assefa D.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:volume":"9876 LNCS","prism:pageRange":"231-241","prism:coverDate":"2016-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2016","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-45246-3_22","dc:description":"Very recently we proposed a promising scheme for tissue classification of multi-parametric magnetic resonance images (MP-MRI) of the brain based on signal analysis in higher dimensional vector spaces. The method treats MP-MR images as colors represented holistically in three (trinion) or four (quaternion) algebraic spaces. Compared to the well known quaternions, the recently proposed three component trinions are more efficient in representation of images with three channels and the respective Fourier transforms allow visualization of their wavenumber spectra as a whole. The current study discusses an edge detection scheme based on statistical metrics derived from locally computed trinion Fourier transforms for use in robust edge detection of MP-MR images and other color medical images. Performance of the proposed scheme is compared against a quaternion formulation and with another vectorial approach. Application of the method is shown in edge detection of various color test images and scenes with different degrees of difficulty. Discussion and preliminary results on the application of the proposed scheme on MP-MR images of brain scans of patients treated for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) have also been included.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071181","afid":"60071181","affilname":"Addis Ababa University","affiliation-city":"Addis Ababa","affiliation-country":"Ethiopia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000474","afid":"60000474","affilname":"Univerzita Hradec Králové","affiliation-city":"Hradec Kralove","affiliation-country":"Czech Republic"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23007922100","authid":"23007922100","authname":"Assefa D.","surname":"Assefa","given-name":"Dawit","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60071181"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000474"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14719632500","authid":"14719632500","authname":"Krejcar O.","surname":"Krejcar","given-name":"Ondrej","initials":"O.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000474"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image processing | Quaternion | Trinion","source-id":"25674","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988664553"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988664553?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84988664553&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84988664553&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988664553","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84988664553","eid":"2-s2.0-84988664553","dc:title":"AIEFS and HEC based emotion estimation using physiological measurements for the children with autism spectrum disorder","dc:creator":"Kiruba K.","prism:publicationName":"Biomedical Research (India)","prism:issn":"0970938X","prism:volume":"2016","prism:issueIdentifier":"Special Issue 2","prism:pageRange":"S237-S250","prism:coverDate":"2016-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2016","dc:description":"The emotion of the children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) cannot be identified and recognized easily. The research in automated emotion recognition methods is steadily growing thrust in the last few years due to applicability in various domains which would benefit from a clear understanding of human emotional states. The studies have shown that a human’s physiological parameters are directly related to his/her psychological reaction from which the emotions can be estimated. There is a strong relationship between human emotion and physiological signals. The major aim of this work is to identify preferable Artificial Intelligent Ensemble Feature Selection (AIEFS) framework and Heterogeneous Ensemble Classification (HEC) model for such a concept. The experiment was necessary to achieve the uniformity in the various aspects of emotion elicitation, data processing, feature selection using EFS, and estimation evaluation using HEC and in order to avoid inconsistency problems. Here, three base classifiers such as Support Vector Regression with Genetic Algorithm (SVR-GA), Multinomial NaiveBayes (MNB) and Ensemble Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (EOS-ELM) that learn different aspects of the emotion dataset samples are used together to make collective decisions in order to enhance performance of health-related message classification. The results indicate that the combination of AIEFS with HEC exhibited the highest accuracy in discrete emotion classification based on physiological features calculated from the parameters like ECG, respiration, skin conductance and skin temperature. Specific discrete emotions were targeted with stimuli from the IAPS database. This work presents experiment based comparative study of four feature selection methods and five machine learning methods commonly used for emotion estimation based on physiological signals.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104520","afid":"60104520","affilname":"K.S.R.

Endstopped cells (also known as hypercomplex) are hypothesized to be selective to curvatures and are greatly represented in area V2.

It is intended for beginning graduate students in mathematics or researchers in physics or engineering. As with the introductory book entitled \"Harmonic Analysis on Symmetric Spaces - Euclidean Space, the Sphere, and the Poincaré Upper Half Plane, the style is informal with an emphasis on motivation, concrete examples, history, and applications. The symmetric spaces considered here are quotients X=G/K, where G is a non-compact real Lie group, such as the general linear group GL(n, P) of all n x n non-singular real matrices, and K=O(n), the maximal compact subgroup of orthogonal matrices. Other examples are Siegel's upper half \"plane\" and the quaternionic upper half \"plane\". In the case of the general linear group, one can identify X with the space Pn of n x n positive definite symmetric matrices. Many corrections and updates have been incorporated in this new edition. Updates include discussions of random matrix theory and quantum chaos, as well as recent research on modular forms and their corresponding L-functions in higher rank. Many applications have been added, such as the solution of the heat equation on Pn, the central limit theorem of Donald St. P. Richards for Pn, results on densest lattice packing of spheres in Euclidean space, and GL(n)-analogs of the Weyl law for eigenvalues of the Laplacian in plane domains.

In this paper, a novel three-dimensional human-computer interaction application is presented based on augmented reality (AR) technology for assisting children with special problems in communication for social innovation. To begin with, three-dimensional human hand model is constructed to estimate and track the hand’s position of users. An extended particle filter is applied for calculating the pose of background and the positions of children. The likelihoods based on the edge map of the image and pixel color values are utilized to estimate the joint likelihood in three-dimensional model. A flexible real-time hand tracking framework using the ‘golden energy’ scoring function is integrated for capturing region of interests. An inertial tracking technique is used for calculating the quaternion. Three-dimensional models from Google SketchUp are employed. We then use a built QR-code for scanning to access the system, and then utilize for selecting a character three-dimensional designed cartoon by applying the Vidinoti image application. After that, representative three-dimensional cartoons and augmented environments are overlaid, so that it is able to entertain children. A printed coloring photo, called Augmented Flexible Tracking is designed and provided in the system for visualization. The process of the system is done in realtime. Our experiments have revealed that the system is beneficial both quantitatively and qualitatively for assisting children with special needs in communication interactively.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016334","afid":"60016334","affilname":"National Taipei University","affiliation-city":"Taipei","affiliation-country":"Taiwan"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001921","afid":"60001921","affilname":"National Institute of Development Administration","affiliation-city":"Bangkok","affiliation-country":"Thailand"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23397129500","authid":"23397129500","authname":"Kerdvibulvech C.","surname":"Kerdvibulvech","given-name":"Chutisant","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001921"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34668547200","authid":"34668547200","authname":"Wang C.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Chih Chien","initials":"C.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016334"}]}],"authkeywords":"Augmented and mixed reality | Augmented reality | Children with special problems | Communication | Educational games | Human-computer interaction | Three-dimensional interaction","source-id":"25674","fund-acr":"NIDA","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"National Institute of Development Administration","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84978653541"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84978653541?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84978653541&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84978653541&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1877050916305713"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84978653541","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84978653541","eid":"2-s2.0-84978653541","dc:title":"Robust Pre-processing Technique Based on Saliency Detection for Content Based Image Retrieval Systems","dc:creator":"Hussain C.A.","prism:publicationName":"Procedia Computer Science","prism:eIssn":"18770509","prism:volume":"85","prism:pageRange":"571-580","prism:coverDate":"2016-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2016","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.procs.2016.05.223","pii":"S1877050916305713","dc:description":"The perceptual quality which attracts viewer attention by making the objects differ from its neighbours is said to be Visual saliency.

In most cases iterative closest point (ICP) and its variants are generally used for pairwise registration process. Considering that the ICP algorithm requires an relatively accurate initial transformation and high overlap a weighted closed-form solution for RGB-D data registration is proposed. In this solution, we weighted and normalized the 3D points based on the theoretical random errors and the dual-number quaternions are used to represent the 3D rigid body motion. Basically, dual-number quaternions provide a closed-form solution by minimizing a cost function. The most important advantage of the closed-form solution is that it provides the optimal transformation in one-step, it does not need to calculate good initial estimates and expressively decreases the demand for computer resources in contrast to the iterative method. Basically, first our method exploits RGB information. We employed a scale invariant feature transformation (SIFT) for extracting, detecting, and matching features. It is able to detect and describe local features that are invariant to scaling and rotation. To detect and filter outliers, we used random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, jointly with an statistical dispersion called interquartile range (IQR). After, a new RGB-D loop-closure solution is implemented based on the volumetric information between pair of point clouds and the dispersion of the random errors. The loop-closure consists to recognize when the sensor revisits some region. Finally, a globally consistent map is created to minimize the registration errors via a graph-based optimization. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with a Kinect dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method can properly map the indoor environment with an absolute accuracy around 1.5% of the travel of a trajectory.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026553","afid":"60026553","affilname":"University of Melbourne","affiliation-city":"Melbourne","affiliation-country":"Australia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113085973","afid":"113085973","affilname":"University Federal of Paraná","affiliation-city":"Curitiba","affiliation-country":"Brazil"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190180053","authid":"57190180053","authname":"Vestena K.M.","surname":"Vestena","given-name":"K.

Higher-dimensional algorithms include quaternion-valued filters. One of the drawbacks filter designers have to cope with is the increasing computational cost due to multidimensional processing. A strategy to reduce the computational complexity of long adaptive filters is to implement block algorithms and update the filter coefficients periodically. More efficient techniques embed frequency-domain processing in block algorithms with the use of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Transform-domain adaptive filters in the quaternion field require quaternion-valued transforms. In this paper we also suggest a simple method to obtain a quaternionic DFT/FFT from a complex DFT/FFT. As an example, we propose the Overlap-Save Quaternion Frequency Domain algorithm.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032350","afid":"60032350","affilname":"Sapienza Università di Roma","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190072880","authid":"57190072880","authname":"Ortolani F.","surname":"Ortolani","given-name":"Francesca","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36444807900","authid":"36444807900","authname":"Comminiello D.","surname":"Comminiello","given-name":"Danilo","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23490528100","authid":"23490528100","authname":"Scarpiniti M.","surname":"Scarpiniti","given-name":"Michele","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005621339","authid":"7005621339","authname":"Uncini A.","surname":"Uncini","given-name":"Aurelio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive filters | Frequency domain | Hypercomplex | Overlap-Save | Quaternion","source-id":"21100204111","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84968547815"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84968547815?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84968547815&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84968547815&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84968547815","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84968547815","eid":"2-s2.0-84968547815","dc:title":"Computer aided diagnosis of mammographic tissue using shapelets in quaternionic representation","dc:creator":"Apostolopoulos G.","prism:publicationName":"IFMBE Proceedings","prism:issn":"16800737","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783319327013"}],"prism:volume":"57","prism:pageRange":"222-227","prism:coverDate":"2016-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2016","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-32703-7_45","dc:description":"In this paper a robust regions-of-suspicion (ROS) diagnosis system on mammograms, recognizing all types of abnormalities is presented and evaluated.

Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) approaches are widely used in land and represent the most precise techniques for localization, but applied underwater, they are still an open and ongoing challenge. This paper presents a general approach to visual 3D pose-based SLAM based on Extended Kalman Filters (EKF). This approach has a general design being applicable to any vehicle with up to 6 Degrees of freedom, so, it is particularly suitable for AUV. It uses only visual data coming from a stereo camera, all orientations involved in the system are represented in the quaternion space in order to avoid the gimbal lock singularities, and the sparsity of the covariance matrix is guaranteed during the whole trajectory since the state vector only includes the vehicle global pose. The vehicle pose is continuously predicted by means of a stereo visual odometer, and eventually corrected with the pose constraints given by a particularization of the Perspective N-Point problem (PNP) [1], applied to the registration of images that most likely close a loop. Experimental results show the important pose corrections given by the SLAM approach with respect to a ground truth, compared with the evident trajectory errors present in the visual odometer estimates.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60118086","afid":"60118086","affilname":"York University, Centre for Vision Research","affiliation-city":"Toronto","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009780","afid":"60009780","affilname":"Universitat de les Illes Balears","affiliation-city":"Palma","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006429","afid":"60006429","affilname":"Universität Koblenz-Landau","affiliation-city":"Koblenz am Rhein","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57105420400","authid":"57105420400","authname":"Solbach M.","surname":"Solbach","given-name":"M.","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60118086"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24079942800","authid":"24079942800","authname":"Bonin-Font F.","surname":"Bonin-Font","given-name":"F.","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009780"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8621745000","authid":"8621745000","authname":"Burguera A.","surname":"Burguera","given-name":"A.","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009780"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202065303","authid":"7202065303","authname":"Oliver G.","surname":"Oliver","given-name":"G.","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009780"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55787519500","authid":"55787519500","authname":"Paulus D.","surname":"Paulus","given-name":"D.","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006429"}]}],"authkeywords":"EKF SLAM | underwater robots | visual navigation","source-id":"4700152485","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84961210600"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84961210600?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84961210600&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84961210600&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84961210600","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84961210600","eid":"2-s2.0-84961210600","dc:title":"Joint polarization-DOA estimation for conical conformal array based on quaternion MUSIC","dc:creator":"Liu S.","prism:publicationName":"Xi Tong Gong Cheng Yu Dian Zi Ji Shu/Systems Engineering and Electronics","prism:issn":"1001506X","prism:volume":"38","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"1-7","prism:coverDate":"2016-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 January 2016","prism:doi":"10.3969/j.issn.1001-506X.2016.01.01","dc:description":"Based on conical conformal array with crossed dipole elements, the quaternion array signal model is built, and the quaternion multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is proposed.

The PSWFs and their applications to wave phenomena modeling, fluid dynamics and filter design played a key role in this development. It is pointed out in this paper that the operator W arising in the Helmholtz equation after the prolate spheroidal change of variables is the sum of three operators, Sξ,α, Sη,β and Tφ, each of which acts on functions of one variable: two of them are modified Sturm-Liouville operators and the other one is, up to a variable coefficient, the Chebyshev operator. We believe that this fact reflects the essence of the separation of variables method in this case. We show that there exists a theory of functions with quaternionic values and of three real variables which is determined by the Moisil-Theodorescu-type operator with quaternionic variable coefficients, and that it is intimately related to the modified Sturm-Liouville operators and to the Chebyshev operator (we call it in this way, since its solutions are related to the classical Chebyshev polynomials). We address all the above and explore some basic facts of the arising quaternionic function theory. We further establish analogues of the basic integral formulae of complex analysis such as those of Borel-Pompeiu, Cauchy, and so on, for this version of quaternionic function theory.

Two sets of synchronous time data are used to construct correlation matrix. According to the relationships of the two sets data and that of the two steering vectors, the array steering vector and the frequency of signals are obtained. The direction of arrival (DOA) is derived by dot division operation and the least square method. The polarization parameters are obtained using the relationship between the dipole steering vector and magnetic loop vector. Without spectral peak searching and parameter matching, this method gives closed-form solution of frequency, DOA and polarization parameters. The proposed algorithm results in a reduction by half of memory requirements for representation of data covariance model and decreases the computational cost. Finally, simulation results verify that the performance of proposed method is superior to the long-vector approach because quaternion matrix operations can maintain the vectorial property of the vector sensor and provide a better subspace approximation than the long-vector approach.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60089942","afid":"60089942","affilname":"Shaanxi University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Hanzhong","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025578","afid":"60025578","affilname":"Xidian University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/10042713200","authid":"10042713200","authname":"Wang L.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Lanmei","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56452424700","authid":"56452424700","authname":"Zou M.","surname":"Zou","given-name":"Minggao","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55827761200","authid":"55827761200","authname":"Wang G.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Guibao","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60089942"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55826253100","authid":"55826253100","authname":"Chen Z.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Zhihai","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"}]}],"authkeywords":"Array signal processing | Direction of arrival | ESPRIT | Polarization | Quaternion | uniform circular array","source-id":"21100197928","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61201295","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84958279992"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84958279992?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84958279992&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84958279992&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84958279992","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84958279992","eid":"2-s2.0-84958279992","dc:title":"High-performance robust three-axis finite-time attitude control approach incorporating quaternion based estimation scheme to overactuated spacecraft","dc:creator":"Mazinan A.H.","prism:publicationName":"International Journal of Engineering, Transactions A: Basics","prism:issn":"17281431","prism:volume":"29","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"53-59","prism:coverDate":"2016-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"January 2016","prism:doi":"10.5829/idosi.ije.2015.29.1a.08","dc:description":"With a focus on investigations in the area of overactuated spacecraft, a new high-performance robust three-axis finite-time attitude control approach, which is organized in connection with the quaternion based estimation scheme is proposed in the present research with respect to state-of-the-art. The approach proposed here is realized based upon double closed loops to deal with the angular rates of the system, in the inner loop, and also the rotational angles of the system in line with the corresponding quaternion, in the outer loop, synchronously. With this goal, a combination of linear and its non-linear terms through the sliding mode control approach and also the proportional derivative based linear quadratic regulator control approach is organized. There is the white measurement noise to be realized the outcomes in such real situations, where it is coped with through the optimal estimation scheme to be designed, correspondingly. The results are organized with regard to the pulse modulation synthesis through the technique of the pulse width pulse frequency to manage a set of on-off reaction thrusters, as long as the control allocation is employed to handle the aforementioned overactuated system under control. The effectiveness of the approach investigated is finally considered in line with a series of the experiments to be tangibly verified.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007196","afid":"60007196","affilname":"Islamic Azad University, South Tehran Branch","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25632293100","authid":"25632293100","authname":"Mazinan A.H.","surname":"Mazinan","given-name":"A.
