Based on this observation, we propose a quaternion-based hybrid attitude control strategy to implement stable hovering and forward flight for a flapping wing vehicle. Specifically, two hysteretic functions are adopted to switch between two control strategies, namely regulating to the desired attitude and pulling back to the stable flight region, so as to deal with a specific geometric constraint, and retain good robustness. Meanwhile, considering the inherent underactuation property of the studied vehicle, the reduced quaternion is introduced to construct feedback signals which are convenient and practical to use. These innovations contribute to a reliable control strategy for the flapping wing vehicles, even with underactuation in attitude. The equilibrium set is proved to be globally asymptotically stable with the help of hybrid control theory. Finally, the proposed controller is implemented in our self-made flapping wing vehicle, with the obtained experimental results clearly showing its superior performance.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018038","afid":"60018038","affilname":"Nankai University","affiliation-city":"Tianjin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57196213681","authid":"57196213681","orcid":"0000-0001-6191-3741","authname":"Qian C.","surname":"Qian","given-name":"Chen","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018038"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55488985700","authid":"55488985700","orcid":"0000-0002-3061-2708","authname":"Fang Y.","surname":"Fang","given-name":"Yongchun","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018038"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57197832852","authid":"57197832852","authname":"Li Y.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Youpeng","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018038"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude control | flapping wing vehicle | hybrid control | quaternions","article-number":"8769883","source-id":"19113","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61633012","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073807378"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073807378?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073807378&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073807378&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073807378","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85073807378","eid":"2-s2.0-85073807378","dc:title":"A new nine-dimensional chaotic lorenz system with quaternion variables: Complicated dynamics, electronic circuit design, anti-anticipating synchronization, and chaotic masking communication application","dc:creator":"Mahmoud E.E.","prism:publicationName":"Mathematics","prism:eIssn":"22277390","prism:volume":"7","prism:issueIdentifier":"10","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2019-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2019","prism:doi":"10.3390/math7100877","dc:description":"In this paper, a chaotic quaternion autonomous nonlinear structure is introduced and intends to be a contribution. It is the first nonlinear dynamical system with quaternion variables to be studied in the literature. With nine dimensions, the new system is a high-dimensional one. Several vital characteristics and features of this model are investigated, such as its Hamiltonian, symmetry, signal flow graph, dissipation, equilibriums and their stability, Lyapunov exponents, Lyapunov dimension, bifurcation diagrams, and chaotic behavior. A circuit implementation is designed to realize the new system, and a scheme is designed to achieve anti-anticipating synchronization (AAS) of two identical chaotic attractors with quaternion variables based on a Lyapunov function and active control. The concept of AAS is yet to be explored in the literature. A simulation experiment is designed and executed to illustrate the effectiveness of the acquired results. After synchronization, numerical outcomes are planned to explain the status variables and errors of these chaotic attractors to prove that AAS is achieved. The secure communication problem is studied based on the obtained events of the AAS of two identical nonlinear Lorenz systems with quaternion variables. AAS connecting the drive and response systems in chaotic systems with quaternion variables is the key to achieving communication.

The BF uses the Bingham distribution, a probability distribution defined on the unit three-sphere, i.e., the space of unit quaternions, to model the attitude of a rigid body, and uses Bayes' formula to update the prediction with new attitude measurements. We compared the BF with the widely used multiplicative extended Kalman filter (MEKF) for accuracy and convergence speed through both the simulated and experimental IMU data. We used the gyroscope and accelerometer signals to estimate the tilt attitude (roll and pitch) with heading angle left uncorrected. We tested two types of measurements: attitude converted from measured acceleration and the measured acceleration itself. Results showed some benefits of BF over MEKF in terms of estimation accuracy and convergence speed from large initial errors. However, the computational cost of BF is also much higher than MEKF. Incidental findings also showed that using the full acceleration measurement improves the accuracy of the MEKF compared to using the attitude measurement converted from acceleration.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032179","afid":"60032179","affilname":"University of Wisconsin-Madison","affiliation-city":"Madison","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003088","afid":"60003088","affilname":"The George Washington University","affiliation-city":"Washington, D.C.","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216553772","authid":"57216553772","orcid":"0000-0002-1979-7115","authname":"Wang W.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Weixin","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032179"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003088"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57197613393","authid":"57197613393","orcid":"0000-0001-5374-7691","authname":"Adamczyk P.G.","surname":"Adamczyk","given-name":"Peter G.","initials":"P.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032179"}]}],"authkeywords":"attitude estimation | Bingham distribution | Bingham filter | IMU attitude | multiplicative extended Kalman filter (MEKF) | SO(3) filter","article-number":"8735785","source-id":"15047","fund-acr":"VCRGE, UW","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education, University of Wisconsin-Madison","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071310168"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071310168?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85071310168&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85071310168&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071310168","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85071310168","eid":"2-s2.0-85071310168","dc:title":"HARDI Segmentation via Fourth-Order Tensors and Anisotropy Preserving Similarity Measures","dc:creator":"Kaushik S.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision","prism:issn":"09249907","prism:eIssn":"15737683","prism:volume":"61","prism:issueIdentifier":"8","prism:pageRange":"1221-1234","prism:coverDate":"2019-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2019","prism:doi":"10.1007/s10851-019-00897-w","dc:description":"In this work, we discuss the higher-order tensors appearing in high angular resolution diffusion tensor imaging, and we have tested two segmentation methods, the Riemannian spectral clustering and the deformable models, using several projections of the fourth-order tensors to the second-order ones, and diverse similarity measures on them. High angular resolution diffusion imaging has proved its effectiveness in modeling white matter brain structures along with the fiber intersection regions, which is of high importance in brain research. Along with other known projections, we observe that the diagonal components of the flattened fourth-order tensors also live in the well-known Riemannian symmetric space of symmetric positive-definite matrices. We discuss and compare several natural approximations of the distance on the latter space to be used in clustering and segmentation algorithms. The results show that some of the projections unfold the geometry of the higher-order tensors very well, and we also propose the exploitation of the spherical linear interpolation spectral quaternion metric, which proves to be very effective. The latter claims are supported by experimental comparison of the effectiveness of our algorithms with the more usual logarithmic Euclidean and spectral quaternionic metrics, in particular in the presence of noise.

The new algorithm is based on error entropy function with Fiducial point and is referred to as the quaternion minimum error entropy with fiducial point (QKMEEF) algorithm. In our previous work we developed quaternion kernel adaptive filter based on minimum error entropy referred to as the quaternion KMEE (QKMEE) algorithm [1]. Since entropy does not change with the mean of the distribution, the algorithm may converge to a set of optimal weights without having zero mean error. Traditionally, to make the zero mean output error, the output during testing session was biased with the mean of errors of training session. However, for non-symmetric or heavy tails error PDF the estimation of error mean is problematic. The minimum error entropy criterion, minimizes Renyi's quadratic entropy of the error between the filter output and desired response or indirectly maximizing the error information potential. Here, the approach is applied to quaternions. Adaptive filtering in quaterion domain intrinsically incorporates component-wise real valued cross-correlation or the coupling within the dimensions of the quaternion input. We apply generalized Hamilton-real (GHR) calculus that is applicable to Hilbert space for evaluating the cost function gradient to develop the Quaternion Minimum Error Entropy Algorithm with Fiducial points. Simulation results are used to show the behavior of the new algorithm (QKMEEF) when signal is non-Gaussian in presence of unimodal noise versus bi-modal noise distributions. Simulation results also show that the new algorithm Quat-KMEEF can track and predict the 4-Dimensional non-stationary process signals where there are correlations between components better than quadruple real-valued KMEEF and Quat-KLMS algorithms.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010451","afid":"60010451","affilname":"Santa Clara University","affiliation-city":"Santa Clara","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14061092900","authid":"14061092900","authname":"Safarian C.","surname":"Safarian","given-name":"Carlo","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010451"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004919562","authid":"7004919562","authname":"Ogunfunmi T.","surname":"Ogunfunmi","given-name":"Tokunbo","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010451"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive filters | Information theoretic learning | Kernel minimum error entropy algorithm | Non-Gaussian signal | Quaternions | Renyis quadratic entropy","source-id":"25548","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064716317"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064716317?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85064716317&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85064716317&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064716317","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85064716317","eid":"2-s2.0-85064716317","dc:title":"Content-based blur image retrieval using quaternion approach and frequency adder LBP","dc:creator":"Sukhia K.N.","prism:publicationName":"Multidimensional Systems and Signal Processing","prism:issn":"09236082","prism:eIssn":"15730824","prism:volume":"30","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"2167-2183","prism:coverDate":"2019-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2019","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11045-019-00643-w","dc:description":"The paper presents a content based image retrieval scheme based on feature extraction and weighing.

An optimization-based method named optimal-REQUEST algorithm is used to determine the attitude quaternion, which can further filter the measurement noise by adjusting the gain of the filter adaptively.

All existing methods are designed to compute all SVD triplets of quaternion matrices at first and then to select the necessary dominant ones for reconstruction. This way costs quite a lot of operational flops and CPU times to compute many superfluous SVD triplets. In this paper, we propose a Lanczos-based method of computing partial (several dominant) SVD triplets of the large-scale quaternion matrices. The partial bidiagonalization of large-scale quaternion matrices is derived by using the Lanczos iteration, and the reorthogonalization and thick-restart techniques are also utilized in the implementation. An algorithm is presented to compute the partial quaternion singular value decomposition. Numerical examples, including principal component analysis, color face recognition, video compression and color image completion, illustrate that the performance of the developed Lanczos-based method for low-rank quaternion approximation is better than that of the state-of-the-art methods.","citedby-count":"36","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014347","afid":"60014347","affilname":"Hong Kong Baptist University","affiliation-city":null,"affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004691","afid":"60004691","affilname":"Jiangsu Normal University","affiliation-city":"Xuzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003736","afid":"60003736","affilname":"Weifang University","affiliation-city":"Weifang","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8264355300","authid":"8264355300","authname":"Jia Z.","surname":"Jia","given-name":"Zhigang","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004691"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34571761900","authid":"34571761900","orcid":"0000-0001-6833-5227","authname":"Ng M.","surname":"Ng","given-name":"Michael K.","initials":"M.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014347"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16317511000","authid":"16317511000","authname":"Song G.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Guang Jing","initials":"G.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003736"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color images | Lanczos method | Partial bidiagonalization | Quaternion SVD","source-id":"25708","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"11771188","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067464917"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067464917?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85067464917&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85067464917&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067464917","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85067464917","eid":"2-s2.0-85067464917","dc:title":"Digital watermarking scheme for colour remote sensing image based on quaternion wavelet transform and tensor decomposition","dc:creator":"Li D.","prism:publicationName":"Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences","prism:issn":"01704214","prism:eIssn":"10991476","prism:volume":"42","prism:issueIdentifier":"14","prism:pageRange":"4664-4678","prism:coverDate":"2019-09-30","prism:coverDisplayDate":"30 September 2019","prism:doi":"10.1002/mma.5668","dc:description":"Digital watermarking is important for protecting the intellectual property of remote sensing images. Unlike watermarking in ordinary colour images, in colour remote sensing images, watermarking has an important requirement: robustness. In this paper, a robust nonblind watermarking scheme for colour remote sensing images, which considers both frequency and statistical pattern features, is constructed based on the quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) and tensor decomposition. Using the QWT, not only the abundant phase information can be used to preserve detailed host image features to improve the imperceptibility of the watermark, but also the frequency coefficients of the host image can provide a stable position to embed the watermark. To further strengthen the robustness, the global statistical feature structure acquired through the tensor Tucker decomposition is employed to distribute the watermark's energy among different colour bands. Because both the QWT frequency coefficients and the tensor decomposition global statistical feature structure are highly stable against external distortion, their integration yields the proposed scheme, which is robust to many image manipulations. A simulation experiment shows that our method can balance the trade-off between imperceptibility and robustness and that it is more robust than the traditional QWT and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) methods under many different types of image manipulations.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020258","afid":"60020258","affilname":"Nanjing Normal University","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195054625","authid":"57195054625","authname":"Li D.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Dongshuang","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020258"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202087145","authid":"57202087145","authname":"Che X.","surname":"Che","given-name":"Xiaoyu","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020258"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36184531700","authid":"36184531700","authname":"Luo W.","surname":"Luo","given-name":"Wen","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020258"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020258"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55821163300","authid":"55821163300","authname":"Hu Y.","surname":"Hu","given-name":"Yong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020258"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020258"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56661452500","authid":"56661452500","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yannan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020258"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23491178000","authid":"23491178000","authname":"Yu Z.","surname":"Yu","given-name":"Zhaoyuan","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020258"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020258"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23490892300","authid":"23490892300","authname":"Yuan L.","surname":"Yuan","given-name":"Linwang","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020258"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020258"}]}],"authkeywords":"colour remote sensing image | digital watermarking | quaternion wavelet transform | tensor decomposition","source-id":"24594","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"2016YFB0502300","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85078012461"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85078012461?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85078012461&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85078012461&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85078012461","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85078012461","eid":"2-s2.0-85078012461","dc:title":"Head motion classification for single-accelerometer virtual reality hardware","dc:creator":"Hachaj T.","prism:publicationName":"2019 5th International Conference on Frontiers of Signal Processing, ICFSP 2019","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781728152585"}],"prism:pageRange":"45-49","prism:coverDate":"2019-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"September 2019","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICFSP48124.2019.8938052","dc:description":"Head motions classification applied to virtual reality (VR) systems is still an open problem without a leading pattern recognition solution. In contrary to typical motion capture pattern recognition problem in this case we use only single inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor. Head motions that we want to recognize in VR systems might be both natural head motions like nodding or shaking head (they might be used while interacting with VR avatars) and also elements of head-based navigation system or interface. The second type of actions is more challenging because it might contains actions that generate motion trajectories that do not appear in real-life, though they have to be possible to execute only by using a head. In this paper we propose a trajectory-based motion features description that is utilized by dynamic time warping (DTW) classificator. The training of the classificator requires using modified dynamic time warping barycenter averaging (DBA) heuristic algorithm which utilizes quaternions to represents rotations. The proposed pattern recognition system together with its evaluation on the set of head motions acquired by VR system is our original contribution. We have evaluated our method on dataset consisted of 8 types of motions performed by two persons (there are 160 motions samples).

However, they both suffer from some well-known issues. Discovering solutions to these artifacts involves ongoing research with the same new development and applications. In this paper, we propose an improved algorithm to reduce the artifact of standard DQS by combining it with LBS. Our algorithm calculates a linear combination of the standard DQS and LBS using a parameter, called the 'deform factor'. The 'deform factor' describes the contributions of DQS and LBS in the skinning process. Our improved skinning algorithm is based on dual quaternions, and it effectively reduces the artifacts of standard DQS. Furthermore, the proposed method presents a visual trade-off between DQS and LBS in real-time. This paper also contributes an extensive experimental analysis showing the robustness of the proposed method and a comparison of its performance relative to the traditional approaches.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020585","afid":"60020585","affilname":"University of Canterbury","affiliation-city":"Christchurch","affiliation-country":"New Zealand"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57212023731","authid":"57212023731","authname":"Yin H.","surname":"Yin","given-name":"Hao","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020585"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7007059503","authid":"7007059503","authname":"Mukundan R.","surname":"Mukundan","given-name":"Ramakarishnan","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020585"}]}],"authkeywords":"Dual quaternion | Skeleton animation | Vertex skinning","article-number":"8901717","source-id":"21100936963","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85075650335"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85075650335?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85075650335&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85075650335&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85075650335","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85075650335","eid":"2-s2.0-85075650335","dc:title":"Saliency Detection Using Wavelet Transform in Hypercomplex Domain","dc:creator":"Yu Y.","prism:publicationName":"Dianzi Yu Xinxi Xuebao/Journal of Electronics and Information Technology","prism:issn":"10095896","prism:volume":"41","prism:issueIdentifier":"9","prism:pageRange":"2231-2238","prism:coverDate":"2019-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 September 2019","prism:doi":"10.11999/JEIT180738","dc:description":"To solve the incompleteness of the salient region obtained by the existing saliency detection method in the frequency domain, a frequency saliency detection method of multi-scale analysis is proposed.

However, the lack of annotated 360° datasets has hindered the application of deep learning techniques on spherical content. This is further exaggerated on tasks where ground truth acquisition is difficult, such as monocular surface estimation. While recent research approaches on the 2D domain overcome this challenge by relying on generating normals from depth cues using RGB-D sensors, this is very difficult to apply on the spherical domain. In this work, we address the unavailability of sufficient 360° ground truth normal data, by leveraging existing 3D datasets and remodelling them via rendering. We present a dataset of 360° images of indoor spaces with their corresponding ground truth surface normal, and train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) on the task of monocular 360° surface estimation. We achieve this by minimizing a novel angular loss function defined on the hyper-sphere using simple quaternion algebra. We put an effort to appropriately compare with other state of the art methods trained on planar datasets and finally, present the practical applicability of our trained model on a spherical image re-lighting task using completely unseen data by qualitatively showing the promising generalization ability of our dataset and model.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026208","afid":"60026208","affilname":"Centre for Research and Technology-Hellas","affiliation-city":"Thessaloniki","affiliation-country":"Greece"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204285258","authid":"57204285258","authname":"Karakottas A.","surname":"Karakottas","given-name":"Antonios","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026208"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188750773","authid":"57188750773","authname":"Zioulis N.","surname":"Zioulis","given-name":"Nikolaos","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026208"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211637772","authid":"57211637772","authname":"Samaras S.","surname":"Samaras","given-name":"Stamatis","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026208"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203874558","authid":"57203874558","authname":"Ataloglou D.","surname":"Ataloglou","given-name":"Dimitrios","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026208"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57215130562","authid":"57215130562","authname":"Gkitsas V.","surname":"Gkitsas","given-name":"Vasileios","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026208"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8238770900","authid":"8238770900","authname":"Zarpalas D.","surname":"Zarpalas","given-name":"Dimitrios","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026208"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602644373","authid":"6602644373","authname":"Daras P.","surname":"Daras","given-name":"Petros","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026208"}]}],"authkeywords":"360° | 360° dataset | cnn | deep learning | deep neural networks | hypersphere | indoor scenes dataset | omnidirectional | quaternion | spherical panorama | surface normals | surface regression","article-number":"8886152","source-id":"21100946588","fund-acr":"H2020","fund-no":"761934","fund-sponsor":"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85074231769"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85074231769?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85074231769&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85074231769&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85074231769","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85074231769","eid":"2-s2.0-85074231769","dc:title":"Pose Estimation for Uncalibrated Visual Servo System Based on QEKF","dc:creator":"Huang Z.","prism:publicationName":"Chinese Journal of Sensors and Actuators","prism:issn":"10041699","prism:volume":"32","prism:issueIdentifier":"9","prism:pageRange":"1352-1358","prism:coverDate":"2019-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 September 2019","prism:doi":"10.3969/j.issn.1004-1699.2019.09.012","dc:description":"A new algorithm of quaternion based EKF was adopted to estimate the target pose in uncalibrated robot visual servo system.

The results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper can significantly improve the accuracy of the target pose estimation and can meet application requirements effectively.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/109913601","afid":"109913601","affilname":"Jinhua Polytechnic","affiliation-city":"Jinhua","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211508948","authid":"57211508948","authname":"Huang Z.","surname":"Huang","given-name":"Zhengjun","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"109913601"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211506582","authid":"57211506582","authname":"Zhou M.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Meifang","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"109913601"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211510378","authid":"57211510378","authname":"Yang H.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Hangxu","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"109913601"}]}],"authkeywords":"EKF | Pose estimation | Quaternion | Uncalibrated | Visual servo","source-id":"144788","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85072629382"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85072629382?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85072629382&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85072629382&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85072629382","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85072629382","eid":"2-s2.0-85072629382","dc:title":"Forward and backward visual fusion approach to motion estimation with high robustness and low cost","dc:creator":"Wang K.","prism:publicationName":"Remote Sensing","prism:eIssn":"20724292","prism:volume":"11","prism:issueIdentifier":"18","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2019-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 September 2019","prism:doi":"10.3390/rs11182139","dc:description":"We present a novel low-cost visual odometry method of estimating the ego-motion (self-motion) for ground vehicles by detecting the changes that motion induces on the images. Different from traditional localization methods that use differential global positioning system (GPS), precise inertial measurement unit (IMU) or 3D Lidar, the proposed method only leverage data from inexpensive visual sensors of forward and backward onboard cameras. Starting with the spatial-temporal synchronization, the scale factor of backward monocular visual odometry was estimated based on the MSE optimization method in a sliding window. Then, in trajectory estimation, an improved two-layers Kalman filter was proposed including orientation fusion and position fusion. Where, in the orientation fusion step, we utilized the trajectory error space represented by unit quaternion as the state of the filter. The resulting system enables high-accuracy, low-cost ego-pose estimation, along with providing robustness capability of handing camera module degradation by automatic reduce the confidence of failed sensor in the fusion pipeline. Therefore, it can operate in the presence of complex and highly dynamic motion such as enter-in-and-out tunnel entrance, texture-less, illumination change environments, bumpy road and even one of the cameras fails. The experiments carried out in this paper have proved that our algorithm can achieve the best performance on evaluation indexes of average in distance (AED), average in X direction (AEX), average in Y direction (AEY), and root mean square error (RMSE) compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms, which indicates that the output results of our approach is superior to other methods.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023380","afid":"60023380","affilname":"Chongqing University","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010752","afid":"60010752","affilname":"Chongqing Normal University","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114416605","afid":"114416605","affilname":"China Automotive Engineering Research Institute Co., Ltd.","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/107083138","afid":"107083138","affilname":"Changan Auto Company","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57198953604","authid":"57198953604","authname":"Wang K.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Ke","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023380"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58364810500","authid":"58364810500","authname":"Huang X.","surname":"Huang","given-name":"Xin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023380"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57208898993","authid":"57208898993","authname":"Chen J.L.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Jun Lan","initials":"J.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010752"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211094662","authid":"57211094662","authname":"Cao C.","surname":"Cao","given-name":"Chuan","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023380"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57196299839","authid":"57196299839","authname":"Xiong Z.","surname":"Xiong","given-name":"Zhoubing","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"107083138"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57214202619","authid":"57214202619","authname":"Chen L.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Long","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"114416605"}]}],"authkeywords":"Mobile mapping | Motion estimation | Sensor fusion | Trajectory fusion","article-number":"2139","source-id":"86430","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"cstc2017rgzn-zdyfX0039","fund-sponsor":"Ford Motor Company","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85056192979"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85056192979?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85056192979&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85056192979&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85056192979","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85056192979","eid":"2-s2.0-85056192979","dc:title":"Geomagnetic Compensation for the Rotating of Magnetometer Array During Magnetic Tracking","dc:creator":"Dai H.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","prism:issn":"00189456","prism:eIssn":"15579662","prism:volume":"68","prism:issueIdentifier":"9","prism:pageRange":"3379-3386","prism:coverDate":"2019-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 September 2019","prism:doi":"10.1109/TIM.2018.2875965","dc:description":"Based on a permanent magnet and a magnetometer array, magnetic tracking approach has some advantages such as wireless, real-time, and no line-of-sight problem. However, its tracking accuracy will be greatly deteriorated by the magnetometer array’s rotating during the tracking process. The reason lies in the relative variation of triaxial geomagnetic components, which should be calibrated before the tracking process. In this paper, we proposed an inertial sensor-based geomagnetic compensation method to reduce the intervention of the triaxial geomagnetic components for the magnetic tracking performance. An inertial measurement unit, which is situated on the magnetometer array, can capture the triaxial rotation of the magnetometer array in real time. As the vector sum of the triaxial geomagnetic components is constant, the rotation vector of the magnetometer array can be converted to the variation of the triaxial geomagnetic components. Thus, the triaxial geomagnetic components, which are included in the magnetometer outputs, can be separated from the sensing signals of permanent magnet even if the magnetometer array is rotating. The experimental results indicate that the magnetic tracking accuracy has been significantly improved. This method extends the application scope of the magnetic tracking approach because it enables both the magnetometer array and magnet to rotate during the tracking process.","citedby-count":"24","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019499","afid":"60019499","affilname":"Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003970","afid":"60003970","affilname":"Zhejiang University","affiliation-city":"Hangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24922694900","authid":"24922694900","authname":"Dai H.","surname":"Dai","given-name":"Houde","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019499"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35932415200","authid":"35932415200","authname":"Hu C.","surname":"Hu","given-name":"Chao","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003970"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193610667","authid":"57193610667","authname":"Su S.","surname":"Su","given-name":"Shijian","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019499"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56547745100","authid":"56547745100","authname":"Lin M.","surname":"Lin","given-name":"Mingqiang","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019499"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35932784000","authid":"35932784000","authname":"Song S.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Shuang","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]}],"authkeywords":"Geomagnetic compensation | Inertial measurement unit (IMU) | Magnetic tracking | Quaternion","source-id":"15361","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062719153"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062719153?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85062719153&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85062719153&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062719153","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85062719153","eid":"2-s2.0-85062719153","dc:title":"Quaternion Harmonic moments and extreme learning machine for color object recognition","dc:creator":"Dad N.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","prism:issn":"13807501","prism:eIssn":"15737721","prism:volume":"78","prism:issueIdentifier":"15","prism:pageRange":"20935-20959","prism:coverDate":"2019-08-15","prism:coverDisplayDate":"15 August 2019","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11042-019-7381-2","dc:description":"The quaternary orthogonal moments have been widely used as color image descriptors owe to their remarkable color and shape information encapsulation capability.

The role of this latter is to maintain the correlation between the four parts, real and imaginary, of the quaternary descriptor coefficients. Several datasets are used for recognition experiments.

We represent the data through quaternion arrays and process it via quaternion algebra. We show how to exploit the correlation between the components of vector-valued datasets by proposing the extension of the frequency-space deconvolution (FXDECON) to its hypercomplex version, the QFXDECON. This rather straightforward extension does not guarantee that the complete vectorial information is taken into consideration. We also show how widely-linear models can exploit this correlation.

A new method for pattern classification using both color and texture information is proposed in this paper. The proposed method includes the following steps: division of each image into global and local samples, texture and color feature extraction from samples using a Haralick statistics and binary quaternion-moment-preserving method, a classification stage using support vector machine, and a final stage of post-processing employing a bagging ensemble. One of the main contributions of this method is the image partition, allowing image representation into global and local features. This partition captures most of the information present in the image for colored texture classification allowing improved results. The proposed method was tested on four databases extensively used in color-texture classification: the Brodatz, VisTex, Outex, and KTH-TIPS2b databases, yielding correct classification rates of 97.63%, 97.13%, 90.78%, and 92.90%, respectively. The use of the post-processing stage improved those results to 99.88%, 100%, 98.97%, and 95.75%, respectively. We compared our results to the best previously published results on the same databases finding significant improvements in all cases.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60122505","afid":"60122505","affilname":"Advanced Mining Technology Center","affiliation-city":"Santiago","affiliation-country":"Chile"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36602976900","authid":"36602976900","authname":"Navarro C.F.","surname":"Navarro","given-name":"Carlos F.","initials":"C.F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122505"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401782386","authid":"7401782386","authname":"Perez C.A.","surname":"Perez","given-name":"Claudio A.","initials":"C.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122505"}]}],"authkeywords":"Bagging post-processing | BQMP and Haralick global-local feature integration | Color-texture feature extraction | Color-texture features | Colored texture pattern classification | Global-local texture classification","article-number":"3130","source-id":"21100829268","fund-acr":"CONICYT","fund-no":"1191610","fund-sponsor":"Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85070456883"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85070456883?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85070456883&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85070456883&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85070456883","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85070456883","eid":"2-s2.0-85070456883","dc:title":"PolSAR image classification via learned superpixels and QCNN integrating color features","dc:creator":"Zhang X.","prism:publicationName":"Remote Sensing","prism:eIssn":"20724292","prism:volume":"11","prism:issueIdentifier":"15","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2019-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 August 2019","prism:doi":"10.3390/rs11151831","dc:description":"Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification plays an important role in various PolSAR image application. And many pixel-wise, region-based classification methods have been proposed for PolSAR images. However, most of the pixel-wise methods can not model local spatial relationship of pixels due to negative effects of speckle noise, and most of the region-based methods fail to figure out the regions with the similar polarimetric features. Considering that color features can provide good visual expression and perform well for image interpretation, in this work, based on the PolSAR pseudo-color image over Pauli decomposition, we propose a supervised PolSAR image classification approach combining learned superpixels and quaternion convolutional neural network (QCNN). First, the PolSAR RGB pseudo-color image is formed under Pauli decomposition. Second, we train QCNN with quaternion PolSAR data converted by RGB channels to extract deep color features and obtain pixel-wise classification map. QCNN treats color channels as a quaternion matrix excavating the relationship among the color channels effectively and avoiding information loss. Third, pixel affinity network (PAN) is utilized to generate the learned superpixels of PolSAR pseudo-color image. The learned superpixels allow the local information exploitation available in the presence of speckle noise. Finally, we fuse the pixel-wise classification result and superpixels to acquire the ultimate pixel-wise PolSAR image classification map. Experiments on three real PolSAR data sets show that the proposed approach can obtain 96.56%, 95.59%, and 92.55% accuracy for Flevoland, San Francisco and Oberpfaffenhofen data set, respectively. And compared with state-of-the-art PolSAR image classification methods, the proposed algorithm can obtained competitive classification results.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023380","afid":"60023380","affilname":"Chongqing University","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55715148000","authid":"55715148000","orcid":"0000-0003-0170-992X","authname":"Zhang X.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xinzheng","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023380"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203824009","authid":"57203824009","authname":"Xia J.","surname":"Xia","given-name":"Jili","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023380"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25722271600","authid":"25722271600","authname":"Tan X.","surname":"Tan","given-name":"Xiaoheng","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023380"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/44261616100","authid":"44261616100","authname":"Zhou X.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Xichuan","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023380"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56422678300","authid":"56422678300","authname":"Wang T.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Tao","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023380"}]}],"authkeywords":"Deep learning | Image classification | Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) | Quaternion convolutional neural network (QCNN) | Superpixels","article-number":"1831","source-id":"86430","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61301224","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}}]}}
