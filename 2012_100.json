Conventional star sensors repeat these processes with Lost-In-Space case. To advance the methods available to solve these problems, this paper presents an autonomous predictive star locations algorithm for the star sensor. The star sensor works in the star predictive star locations case after Lost-In-Space case. The predictive quaternion is predicted with previous continuous two frames quaternion at first. The predictive locations of recognized stars in star image are calculated with the predictive quaternion. The corresponding true locations of recognized stars are obtained in the threshold scan window of predictive locations of recognized stars. This results in only several pixels in star image to be scanned while the star locations are obtained from star image. Then all the unrecognized stars in FOV are searched from the star catalog stored in star sensor. The predictive locations of unrecognized stars in star image are calculated with predictive quaternion. The corresponding true locations of unrecognized stars are obtained within the threshold scan window of predictive locations of unrecognized stars. The true locations of unrecognized stars are identified with information of recognized stars. This avoids Lost-In-Space procedure to identify these unrecognized stars in FOV. The speed and the accuracy of this algorithm are successfully demonstrated in comparison with the classics star locations algorithms which use the angular velocity as provided by a rate gyro. Finally the autonomous predictive star locations algorithm was successfully demonstrated with real sky experiment in 2009 and on-orbit in 2010. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers.

First, a quaternion model of linear array with two-components EM vector-sensors is presented. Based on the quaternion model, a quaternion MVDR (QMVDR) beam former is derived. The quaternion-valued output y(n) of the QMVDR consists of two complex components y 1(n) and y 2(n). In y 2(n), there exist only the interference and noise components, but no desired signal. The desired signal is included in y 1(n) and it is corrupted by the interference and noise. To extract the desired signal, we can employ y 2(n) to cancel partly the interference component in y 1(n). Thus, an interference and noise cancellation (INC) algorithm of QMVDR is proposed. The INC algorithm of QMVDR beam former is similar to the generalized side lobe canceller. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a much better performance in terms of output SINR than existing ones. © 2012 IEEE.","citedby-count":"15","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073486","afid":"60073486","affilname":"Aviation University of Air Force","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007711","afid":"60007711","affilname":"Jilin University","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8534150300","authid":"8534150300","authname":"Tao J.","surname":"Tao","given-name":"Jian Wu","initials":"J.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073486"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13310202400","authid":"13310202400","authname":"Chang W.","surname":"Chang","given-name":"Wen Xiu","initials":"W.X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]}],"authkeywords":"EM vector-sensor array | hypercomplex processes | interference cancellation algorithm | polarization signal processing | quaternion beamforming","article-number":"6188018","source-id":"21100202120","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84860679156"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84860679156?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84860679156&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84860679156&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84860679156","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84860679156","eid":"2-s2.0-84860679156","dc:title":"Predicting human gaze using quaternion DCT image signature saliency and face detection","dc:creator":"Schauerte B.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision","prism:issn":"21583978","prism:eIssn":"21583986","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781467302333"}],"prism:pageRange":"137-144","prism:coverDate":"2012-05-11","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","prism:doi":"10.1109/WACV.2012.6163035","dc:description":"We combine and extend the previous work on DCT-based image signatures and face detection to determine the visual saliency.

Key human joint points are detected automatically and the undetected points are estimated with Kalman filters. Multiple motion models are learned from motion capture data using a ridge regression method. The model set that covers the total motion set is designed on the basis of topological and compatibility relationships, while the VSMM algorithm is used to estimate quaternion vectors of joint rotation.

IGS systems use localization systems to track and visualize surgical tools overlaid on top of preoperative images of the patient during surgery. The most commonly used localization systems in the Operating Rooms (OR) are optical tracking systems (OTS) due to their ease of use and cost effectiveness. However, OTS' suffer from the major drawback of line-of-sight requirements. State space approaches based on different implementations of the Kalman filter have recently been investigated in order to compensate for short line-of-sight occlusion. However, the proposed parameterizations for the rigid body orientation suffer from singularities at certain values of rotation angles. The purpose of this work is to develop a quaternion-based Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for robust optical tracking of both position and orientation of surgical tools in order to compensate marker occlusion issues. This paper presents preliminary results towards a Kalman-based Sensor Management Engine (SME). The engine will filter and fuse multimodal tracking streams of data. This work was motivated by our experience working in robot-based applications for keyhole neurosurgery (ROBOCAST project). The algorithm was evaluated using real data from NDI Polaris tracker. The results show that our estimation technique is able to compensate for marker occlusion with a maximum error of 2.5° for orientation and 2.36 mm for position. The proposed approach will be useful in over-crowded state-of-the-art ORs where achieving continuous visibility of all tracked objects will be difficult. © 2012 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60114004","afid":"60114004","affilname":"Kitware, Inc.","affiliation-city":"Clifton Park","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023256","afid":"60023256","affilname":"Politecnico di Milano","affiliation-city":"Milan","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54418169900","authid":"54418169900","authname":"Vaccarella A.","surname":"Vaccarella","given-name":"Alberto","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203951877","authid":"57203951877","authname":"De Momi E.","surname":"De Momi","given-name":"Elena","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55199159700","authid":"55199159700","authname":"Valenti M.","surname":"Valenti","given-name":"Marta","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005615860","authid":"7005615860","authname":"Ferrigno G.","surname":"Ferrigno","given-name":"Giancarlo","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7801316765","authid":"7801316765","authname":"Enquobahrie A.","surname":"Enquobahrie","given-name":"Andinet","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60114004"}]}],"authkeywords":"IGSTK | Optical Tracking System | Surgical navigation | Unscented Kalman Filter","article-number":"83161K","source-id":"130022","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84859909348"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84859909348?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84859909348&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84859909348&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84859909348","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84859909348","eid":"2-s2.0-84859909348","dc:title":"Learning features for streak detection in dermoscopic color images using localized radial flux of principal intensity curvature","dc:creator":"Mirzaalian H.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the Workshop on Mathematical Methods in Biomedical Image Analysis","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781467303521"}],"prism:pageRange":"97-101","prism:coverDate":"2012-04-24","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","prism:doi":"10.1109/MMBIA.2012.6164758","dc:description":"Malignant melanoma (MM) is one of the most frequent types of cancers among the world's white population.

Thus, the prerequisite for attitude determination technique based on GPS is to calculate baselines between antennas to millimeter level of accuracy. For accurate attitude solutions to be attained, carrier phase double differences are used as main type of measurements. The use of carrier phase measurements leads to the problem of precise determination of the ambiguous integer number of cycles in the initial carrier phase (integer ambiguity). In this work two algorithms (LSAST and LAMBDA) were implemented and tested for ambiguity resolution allowing accurate real-time attitude determination using measurements given by GPS receivers in coupled form. Platform orientation was obtained using quaternions formulation, and the results showed that LSAST method performance is similar to LAMBDA as far as the number of epochs which are necessary to resolve ambiguities is concerned, but with processing time significantly higher. The final result accuracy was similar for both methods, better than 0.1() to 0.2(), when baselines are considered in decoupled form.

Traditionally, a white light source is used for illumination. Recently, multispectral imaging has drawn attention because of its high recognition accuracy. Multispectral palmprint systems can provide more discriminant information under different illuminations in a short time, thus they can achieve better recognition accuracy. Previously, multispectral palmprint images were taken as a kind of multi-modal biometrics, and the fusion scheme on the image level or matching score level was used. However, some spectral information will be lost during image level or matching score level fusion. In this study, we propose a new method for multispectral images based on a quaternion model which could fully utilize the multispectral information. Firstly, multispectral palmprint images captured under red, green, blue and near-infrared (NIR) illuminations were represented by a quaternion matrix, then principal component analysis (PCA) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) were applied respectively on the matrix to extract palmprint features. After that, Euclidean distance was used to measure the dissimilarity between different features. Finally, the sum of two distances and the nearest neighborhood classifier were employed for recognition decision. Experimental results showed that using the quaternion matrix can achieve a higher recognition rate. Given 3000 test samples from 500 palms, the recognition rate can be as high as 98.83%.© 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","citedby-count":"44","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073423","afid":"60073423","affilname":"Baoji University of Arts and Sciences","affiliation-city":"Baoji","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025278","afid":"60025278","affilname":"Tsinghua University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/112787844","afid":"112787844","affilname":"Technical Physics Institute of Heilongjiang Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36560586300","authid":"36560586300","authname":"Xu X.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Xingpeng","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26653574000","authid":"26653574000","authname":"Guo Z.","surname":"Guo","given-name":"Zhenhua","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025278"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/53364470900","authid":"53364470900","authname":"Song C.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Changjiang","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"112787844"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55719081300","authid":"55719081300","authname":"Li Y.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Yafeng","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073423"}]}],"authkeywords":"DWT | Multispectral palmprints | PCA | Quaternion","source-id":"130124","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84859098339"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84859098339?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84859098339&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84859098339&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84859098339","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84859098339","eid":"2-s2.0-84859098339","dc:title":"Quaternion structural similarity: A new quality index for color images","dc:creator":"Kolaman A.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","prism:issn":"10577149","prism:volume":"21","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"1526-1536","prism:coverDate":"2012-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2012","prism:doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2181522","dc:description":"One of the most important issues for researchers developing image processing algorithms is image quality. Methodical quality evaluation, by showing images to several human observers, is slow, expensive, and highly subjective. On the other hand, a visual quality matrix (VQM) is a fast, cheap, and objective tool for evaluating image quality. Although most VQMs are good in predicting the quality of an image degraded by a single degradation, they poorly perform for a combination of two degradations. An example for such degradation is the color crosstalk (CTK) effect, which introduces blur with desaturation. CTK is expected to become a bigger issue in image quality as the industry moves toward smaller sensors. In this paper, we will develop a VQM that will be able to better evaluate the quality of an image degraded by a combined blur/desaturation degradation and perform as well as other VQMs on single degradations such as blur, compression, and noise. We show why standard scalar techniques are insufficient to measure a combined blur/desaturation degradation and explain why a vectorial approach is better suited. We introduce quaternion image processing (QIP), which is a true vectorial approach and has many uses in the fields of physics and engineering. Our new VQM is a vectorial expansion of structure similarity using QIP, which gave it its nameQuaternion Structural SIMilarity (QSSIM). We built a new database of a combined blur/desaturation degradation and conducted a quality survey with human subjects. An extensive comparison between QSSIM and other VQMs on several image quality databasesincluding our new databaseshows the superiority of this new approach in predicting visual quality of color images. © 2011 IEEE.","citedby-count":"107","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027161","afid":"60027161","affilname":"Ben-Gurion University of the Negev","affiliation-city":"Beer Sheva","affiliation-country":"Israel"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002306","afid":"60002306","affilname":"University of Calgary","affiliation-city":"Calgary","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"pubmed-id":"22203713","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35210753900","authid":"35210753900","authname":"Kolaman A.","surname":"Kolaman","given-name":"Amir","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027161"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003665456","authid":"7003665456","authname":"Yadid-Pecht O.","surname":"Yadid-Pecht","given-name":"Orly","initials":"O.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002306"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image processing | hypercomplex numbers | image quality index | quaternion image processing (QIP)","article-number":"6112222","source-id":"25534","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84858973706"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84858973706?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84858973706&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84858973706&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84858973706","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84858973706","eid":"2-s2.0-84858973706","dc:title":"Fast-decodable asymmetric space-time codes from division algebras","dc:creator":"Vehkalahti R.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","prism:issn":"00189448","prism:volume":"58","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"2362-2385","prism:coverDate":"2012-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2012","prism:doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2176310","dc:description":"Multiple-input double-output (MIDO) codes are important in the near-future wireless communications, where the portable end-user device is physically small and will typically contain at most two receive antennas. Especially tempting is the 4 × 2 channel due to its immediate applicability in the digital video broadcasting (DVB). Such channels optimally employ rate-two space-time (ST) codes consisting of (4 × 4) matrices. Unfortunately, such codes are in general very complex to decode, hence setting forth a call for constructions with reduced complexity. Recently, some reduced complexity constructions have been proposed, but they have mainly been based on different ad hoc methods and have resulted in isolated examples rather than in a more general class of codes. In this paper, it will be shown that a family of division algebra based MIDO codes will always result in at least 37.5% worst-case complexity reduction, while maintaining full diversity and, for the first time, the nonvanishing determinant (NVD) property. The reduction follows from the fact that, similarly to the Alamouti code, the codes will be subsets of matrix rings of the Hamiltonian quaternions, hence allowing simplified decoding. At the moment, such reductions are among the best known for rate-two MIDO codes [5], [6]. Several explicit constructions are presented and shown to have excellent performance through computer simulations. © 2006 IEEE.","citedby-count":"34","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60103653","afid":"60103653","affilname":"Aalto University","affiliation-city":"Espoo","affiliation-country":"Finland"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006876","afid":"60006876","affilname":"Turun yliopisto","affiliation-city":"Turku","affiliation-country":"Finland"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005510","afid":"60005510","affilname":"Nanyang Technological University","affiliation-city":"Singapore City","affiliation-country":"Singapore"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14057206300","authid":"14057206300","authname":"Vehkalahti R.","surname":"Vehkalahti","given-name":"Roope","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006876"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6504103597","authid":"6504103597","authname":"Hollanti C.","surname":"Hollanti","given-name":"Camilla","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006876"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60103653"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16307845700","authid":"16307845700","authname":"Oggier F.","surname":"Oggier","given-name":"Frédérique","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005510"}]}],"authkeywords":"Coding gain | cyclic division algebra | digital video broadcasting next generation handheld (DVB-NGH) | fast maximum-likelihood (ML) sphere decoding | Hamiltonian quaternions | Hasse invariants | lattices | low-complexity space-time block codes (STBCs) | multiple-input single/double/multiple-output (MISO/MIDO/MIMO) | nonvanishing determinant (NVD) | orders","article-number":"6084746","source-id":"15107","fund-acr":"NRF","fund-no":"NRF-CRP2-2007-03","fund-sponsor":"National Research Foundation Singapore","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84858693486"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84858693486?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84858693486&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84858693486&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84858693486","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84858693486","eid":"2-s2.0-84858693486","dc:title":"Attitude and heading reference system with acceleration compensation","dc:creator":"Hemerly E.M.","prism:publicationName":"Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology","prism:issn":"00022667","prism:volume":"84","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"87-93","prism:coverDate":"2012-03-26","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","prism:doi":"10.1108/00022661211207893","dc:description":"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to employ an extended Kalman filter for implementing an AHRS (attitude and heading reference system) with acceleration compensation, thereby improving the reliability of such systems, since this removes the usual restrictive assumption that the vehicle is undergoing a non-accelerated maneuver. Design/methodology/approach - MARG (magnetic, acceleration and rate gyros) sensors constitute the basic hardware, which are integrated by the Kalman filter. The error dynamics for attitude and gyro biases is obtained in the navigation frame, providing a much simpler approach than usually taken in the literature, since it relies on direct quaternion differentiation. The state vector associated to the error dynamics possesses six components: three are associated to the quaternion error and three concern gyro bias estimates. Findings - The AHRS is implemented in an ARM (Advanced RISC Machine) processor and tested with experimental data. The accelerated case is treated by two complementary approaches: by changing the noise variance in the Kalman filter, and by obtaining an acceleration information from GPS (global positioning system) velocity measurements. Experimental results are presented and the performance is compared with commercial ARHS systems. Practical implications - The proposed AHRS can be implemented with low cost MARG sensors, and GPS aiding, with use for instance in UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) and small aircrafts' attitude estimation, for navigation and control applications. Originality/value - Usually the AHRS designs employ as states total gyro bias and Euler angles, or quaternion, and do not consider the accelerated case. Here the state is comprised by gyro bias and quaternion error variables, which attenuates the effect of nonlinearities, and two complementary procedures tackle the accelerated case: acceleration correction by using a GPS derived acceleration signal and change in the output noise covariance used by the Kalman filter. © 2012 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The method has been initially designed for, and applied to, signals representing audio data. Afterwords it has been successfully modified and applied to many other fields of study. In this paper, we present the results of researches on the generalized DTW method designed for use with rotational sets of data parameterized by quaternions. The need to compare and process quaternion time series has been gaining in importance recently. Three-dimensional motion data processing is one of the most important applications here. Specifically, it is applied in the context of motion capture, and in many cases all rotational signals are described in this way. We propose a construction of generalized method called quaternion dynamic time warping (QDTW), which makes use of specific properties of quaternion space. It allows for the creation of a family of algorithms that deal with the higher order features of the rotational trajectory. This paper focuses on the analysis of the properties of this new approach. Numerical results show that the proposed method allows for efficient element assignment.

This paper considers the more challenging problem of deriving the locally most powerful invariant tests (LMPITs), which can be obtained, even without an explicit expression for the maximal invariants, thanks to the Wijsman's theorem. Specifically, we consider three binary hypothesis testing problems involving the two main kinds of quaternion properness, and show that the LMPIT statistics are given by the Frobenius norm of three previously defined sample coherence matrices. The proposed detectors exhibit interesting connections with the problem of testing for the properness of a complex vector, and with the problems of testing for the sphericity of a four-dimensional real (or two-dimensional complex proper) vector. Additionally, some numerical examples show that in general, the proposed LMPITs outperform their GLRT counterparts, and in some cases the performance gap is very noticeable. © 2011 IEEE.","citedby-count":"14","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015179","afid":"60015179","affilname":"Universidad de Cantabria","affiliation-city":"Santander","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8561499600","authid":"8561499600","authname":"Vía J.","surname":"Vía","given-name":"Javier","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015179"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602194711","authid":"6602194711","authname":"Vielva L.","surname":"Vielva","given-name":"Luis","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015179"}]}],"authkeywords":"Locally most powerful invariant test (LMPIT) | maximal invariant | properness | quaternions | second-order circularity | Wijsman's theorem","article-number":"6096451","source-id":"17391","fund-acr":"MICINN","fund-no":"TEC2010-19545-C04-03","fund-sponsor":"Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84856216157"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84856216157?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84856216157&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84856216157&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84856216157","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84856216157","eid":"2-s2.0-84856216157","dc:title":"Deconvolution of multicomponent seismic data by means of quaternions: Theory and preliminary results","dc:creator":"Menanno G.","prism:publicationName":"Geophysical Prospecting","prism:issn":"00168025","prism:eIssn":"13652478","prism:volume":"60","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"217-238","prism:coverDate":"2012-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"March 2012","prism:doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2478.2011.00988.x","dc:description":"Multicomponent seismic data are acquired by orthogonal geophones that record a vectorial wavefield. Since the single components are not independent, the processing should be performed jointly for all the components. In this contribution, we use hypercomplex numbers, specifically quaternions, to implement the Wiener deconvolution for multicomponent seismic data. This new approach directly derives from the complex Wiener filter theory, but special care must be taken in the algorithm implementation due to the peculiar properties of quaternion algebra. Synthetic and real data examples show that quaternion deconvolution, either spiking or predictive, generally performs superiorly to the standard (scalar) deconvolution because it properly takes into account the vectorial nature of the wavefields.

However, some key characteristics of the human visual system (HVS) are still neglected in building these saliency detection models. In this paper, we propose a new saliency detection model based on the human visual sensitivity and the amplitude spectrum of quaternion Fourier transform (QFT). We use the amplitude spectrum of QFT to represent the color, intensity, and orientation distributions for image patches. The saliency value for each image patch is calculated by not only the differences between the QFT amplitude spectrum of this patch and other patches in the whole image, but also the visual impacts for these differences determined by the human visual sensitivity. The experiment results show that the proposed saliency detection model outperforms the state-of-the-art detection models. In addition, we apply our proposed model in the application of image retargeting and achieve better performance over the conventional algorithms. © 2006 IEEE.","citedby-count":"144","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60078616","afid":"60078616","affilname":"School of Computer Science and Engineering","affiliation-city":"Singapore City","affiliation-country":"Singapore"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018029","afid":"60018029","affilname":"National Tsing Hua University","affiliation-city":"Hsinchu","affiliation-country":"Taiwan"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005510","afid":"60005510","affilname":"Nanyang Technological University","affiliation-city":"Singapore City","affiliation-country":"Singapore"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8435698900","authid":"8435698900","authname":"Fang Y.","surname":"Fang","given-name":"Yuming","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60078616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8574872000","authid":"8574872000","authname":"Lin W.","surname":"Lin","given-name":"Weisi","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60078616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7405441352","authid":"7405441352","authname":"Lee B.S.","surname":"Lee","given-name":"Bu Sung","initials":"B.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60078616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401968617","authid":"7401968617","authname":"Lau C.T.","surname":"Lau","given-name":"Chiew Tong","initials":"C.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60078616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55737671700","authid":"55737671700","authname":"Chen Z.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Zhenzhong","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005510"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57210925364","authid":"57210925364","authname":"Lin C.W.","surname":"Lin","given-name":"Chia Wen","initials":"C.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018029"}]}],"authkeywords":"Amplitude spectrum | Fourier transform | human visual sensitivity | saliency detection | visual attention","article-number":"6029456","source-id":"16211","fund-acr":"MOE","fund-no":"T208B1218","fund-sponsor":"Ministry of Education - Singapore","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84857467348"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84857467348?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84857467348&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84857467348&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84857467348","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84857467348","eid":"2-s2.0-84857467348","dc:title":"Bundle block adjustment of aerial imagery based on unit dual quaternion","dc:creator":"Gong H.","prism:publicationName":"Wuhan Daxue Xuebao (Xinxi Kexue Ban)/Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University","prism:issn":"16718860","prism:volume":"37","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"154-159","prism:coverDate":"2012-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"February 2012","dc:description":"We present a bundle block adjustment method of aerial images based on unit dual quaternion.

Researchers working with low-cost digital cameras and off-the-shelf lenses generally favor camera calibration techniques that do not rely on specialized optical equipment, modifications to the hardware, or an a priori knowledge of the vision system. Most of the commonly used calibration techniques are based on the observation of a single 3-D target or multiple planar (2-D) targets with a large number of control points. This paper presents a novel calibration technique that offers improved accuracy, robustness, and efficiency over a wide range of lens distortion. This technique operates by minimizing the error between the reconstructed image points and their experimentally determined counterparts in distortion free space. This facilitates the incorporation of the exact lens distortion model. In addition, expressing spatial orientation in terms of unit quaternions greatly enhances the proposed calibration solution by formulating a minimally redundant system of equations that is free of singularities. Extensive performance benchmarking consisting of both computer simulation and experiments confirmed higher accuracy in calibration regardless of the amount of lens distortion present in the optics of the camera. This paper also experimentally confirmed that a comprehensive lens distortion model including higher order radial and tangential distortion terms improves calibration accuracy. © 2011 IEEE.","citedby-count":"54","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019000","afid":"60019000","affilname":"Memorial University of Newfoundland","affiliation-city":"St John's","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57220631253","authid":"57220631253","authname":"Rahman T.","surname":"Rahman","given-name":"Taufiqur","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019000"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602984273","authid":"6602984273","authname":"Krouglicof N.","surname":"Krouglicof","given-name":"Nicholas","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019000"}]}],"authkeywords":"Camera calibration | image formation | lens distortion | modeling | performance benchmarking | quaternions","article-number":"5982395","source-id":"25534","fund-acr":"NSERC","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84856218640"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84856218640?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84856218640&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84856218640&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1361841511001630"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84856218640","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84856218640","eid":"2-s2.0-84856218640","dc:title":"Feature-based interpolation of diffusion tensor fields and application to human cardiac DT-MRI","dc:creator":"Yang F.","prism:publicationName":"Medical Image Analysis","prism:issn":"13618415","prism:eIssn":"13618423","prism:volume":"16","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"459-481","prism:coverDate":"2012-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"February 2012","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.media.2011.11.003","pii":"S1361841511001630","dc:description":"Diffusion tensor interpolation is an important issue in the application of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) to the human heart, all the more as the points representing the myocardium of the heart are often sparse. We propose a feature-based interpolation framework for the tensor fields from cardiac DT-MRI, by taking into account inherent relationships between tensor components. In this framework, the interpolation consists in representing a diffusion tensor in terms of two tensor features, eigenvalues and orientation, interpolating the Euler angles or the quaternion relative to tensor orientation and the logarithmically transformed eigenvalues, and reconstructing the tensor to be interpolated from the interpolated eigenvalues and tensor orientations. The results obtained with the aid of both synthetic and real cardiac DT-MRI data demonstrate that the feature-based schemes based on Euler angles or quaternions not only maintain the advantages of Log-Euclidean and Riemannian interpolation as for preserving the tensor's symmetric positive-definiteness and the monotonic determinant variation, but also preserve, at the same time, the monotonicity of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) values, which is not the case with Euclidean, Cholesky and Log-Euclidean methods. As a result, both interpolation schemes remove the phenomenon of FA collapse, and consequently avoid introducing artificial fiber crossing, with the difference that the quaternion is independent of coordinate system while Euler angles have the property of being more suitable for sophisticated interpolations. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","citedby-count":"33","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025084","afid":"60025084","affilname":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019970","afid":"60019970","affilname":"North Shore University Hospital","affiliation-city":"Manhasset","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016253","afid":"60016253","affilname":"INSA Lyon","affiliation-city":"Villeurbanne","affiliation-country":"France"}],"pubmed-id":"22154961","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56408792200","authid":"56408792200","authname":"Yang F.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Feng","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016253"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55629946300","authid":"55629946300","authname":"Zhu Y.M.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Yue Min","initials":"Y.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016253"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005497961","authid":"7005497961","authname":"Magnin I.E.","surname":"Magnin","given-name":"Isabelle E.","initials":"I.E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016253"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8698697600","authid":"8698697600","authname":"Luo J.H.","surname":"Luo","given-name":"Jian Hua","initials":"J.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56090654400","authid":"56090654400","authname":"Croisille P.","surname":"Croisille","given-name":"Pierre","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016253"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004959077","authid":"7004959077","authname":"Kingsley P.B.","surname":"Kingsley","given-name":"Peter B.","initials":"P.B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019970"}]}],"authkeywords":"Diffusion tensor imaging | Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging | Euler angle | Quaternion | Tensor interpolation","source-id":"17271","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"30911130364","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84862933761"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84862933761?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84862933761&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84862933761&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84862933761","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84862933761","eid":"2-s2.0-84862933761","dc:title":"Colorization using quaternion algebra with automatic scribble generation","dc:creator":"Ding X.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783642273544"}],"prism:volume":"7131 LNCS","prism:pageRange":"103-114","prism:coverDate":"2012-01-18","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-27355-1_12","dc:description":"In current colorization techniques, major user intervention is required in the form of tedious, time-consuming scribble drawing. Moreover, color leakage usually occurs across contours and object boundaries. In this paper, we focus on automatic scribble generation and structure-preservation mechanism, which are still open issues of colorization. Firstly, we generate scribbles automatically along points where the spatial distribution entropy achieves locally extreme value. Given the color scribbles, we compute quaternion wavelet phases to conduct colorization along equal-phase lines. These lines across scribbles and monochrome patches locate textures with similar pattern distribution. Contour 'strength' model is also established in scale space to direct color propagation among similar edge structures. Finally, we reconstruct color image patches as vector elements using polar representation in quaternion algebra, well-preserving interrelationship between color channels. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed colorization method can achieve natural color transitions between different objects with automatically generated scribbles. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","citedby-count":"15","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025084","afid":"60025084","affilname":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56198054400","authid":"56198054400","authname":"Ding X.","surname":"Ding","given-name":"Xiaowei","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55695017800","authid":"55695017800","authname":"Xu Y.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Yi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56453805200","authid":"56453805200","authname":"Deng L.","surname":"Deng","given-name":"Lei","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7406503333","authid":"7406503333","authname":"Yang X.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Xiaokang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]}],"authkeywords":"automatic scribbles generation | colorization | quaternion algebra | structure-preservation mechanism","source-id":"25674","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84855338873"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84855338873?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84855338873&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84855338873&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84855338873","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84855338873","eid":"2-s2.0-84855338873","dc:title":"Adaptive Fourier decomposition of functions in quaternionic Hardy spaces","dc:creator":"Qian T.","prism:publicationName":"Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences","prism:issn":"01704214","prism:eIssn":"10991476","prism:volume":"35","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"43-64","prism:coverDate":"2012-01-15","prism:coverDisplayDate":"15 January 2012","prism:doi":"10.1002/mma.1532","dc:description":"We study decompositions of functions in the Hardy spaces into linear combinations of the basic functions in the orthogonal rational systems B n, which are obtained in the respective contexts through Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process on shifted Cauchy kernels.
