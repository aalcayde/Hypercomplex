The manifold of projective shapes of k-ads in 3D containing a projective frame at five given landmark indices has a natural Lie group structure, which is inherited from the quaternion multiplication. Here, given the small sample size, one estimates the mean 3D projective shape change in two populations, based on independent random samples of possibly different sizes using Efron's nonparametric bootstrap. This methodology is applied in three relevant applications of analysis of 3D scenes from digital images: visual quality control, face recognition, and scene recognition.

First, by using the algebra of quaternions, we introduce the definition of quaternion higher-order spectra (QHOS) in the spatial domain and derive its equivalent form in the frequency domain. Then, QHOS invariants with respect to rotation, translation, and scaling transformations for color images are constructed using the central slice theorem and quaternion bispectral analysis. The feature data are further reduced to a smaller set using quaternion principal component analysis. The proposed method can deal with color images in a holistic manner, and the constructed QHOS invariants are highly immune to background noise. Experimental results show that the extracted QHOS invariants form compact and isolated clusters, and that a simple minimum distance classifier can yield high recognition accuracy.

This study evaluated the concurrent validity of trunk accelerations derived from a tri-axial inertial measurement unit while walking on firm, compliant and uneven surfaces and contrasted two methods used to remove gravitational accelerations; i) subtraction of the best linear fit from the data (detrending); and ii) use of orientation information (quaternions) from the inertial measurement unit. Twelve older and twelve younger adults walked at their preferred speed along firm, compliant and uneven walkways. Accelerations were evaluated for the thoracic spine (T12) using a tri-axial inertial measurement unit and an eleven-camera Vicon system. The findings demonstrated excellent agreement between accelerations derived from the inertial measurement unit and motion analysis system, including while walking on uneven surfaces that better approximate a real-world setting (all differences <0.16 m.s-2). Detrending produced slightly better agreement between the inertial measurement unit and Vicon system on firm surfaces (delta range: -0.05 to 0.06 vs. 0.00 to 0.14 m.s-2), whereas the quaternion method performed better when walking on compliant and uneven walkways (delta range: -0.16 to -0.02 vs. -0.07 to 0.07 m.s-2). The technique used to compensate for gravitational accelerations requires consideration in future research, particularly when walking on compliant and uneven surfaces. These findings demonstrate trunk accelerations can be accurately measured using a wireless inertial measurement unit and are appropriate for research that evaluates healthy populations in complex environments.

applications are being widely promoted and plentiful research related to data processing and high precision geo-referencing technologies is under way. The exterior orientation parameters (EOPs), which are measured by the integrated positioning and orientation system (POS) of airborne three-line sensors, however, have inevitable systematic errors, so the level of precision of direct geo-referencing is not sufficiently accurate for surveying and mapping applications. Consequently, a few ground control points are necessary to refine the exterior orientation parameters, and this paper will discuss bundle block adjustment models based on the systematic error compensation and the orientation image, considering the principle of an image sensor and the characteristics of the integrated POS. Unlike the models available in the literature, which mainly use a quaternion to represent the rotation matrix of exterior orientation, three rotation angles are directly used in order to effectively model and eliminate the systematic errors of the POS observations. Very good experimental results have been achieved with several real datasets that verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed adjustment models.

In this letter, a fast, efficient region-of-interest extraction method based on frequency domain analysis and salient region detection (FDA-SRD) is proposed. First, the HSI transform is used to preprocess the remote sensing image from RGB space to HSI space. Second, a frequency domain analysis strategy based on quaternion Fourier transform was employed to rapidly generate the saliency map. Finally, the salient regions are described by an adaptive threshold segmentation algorithm based on Gaussian Pyramids. Compared with existing models, the new algorithm is computationally more efficient and provides more visually accurate detection results.

These are invariant under direct similarity transformations (translations, rotations, scale) and marginal treatment of colors images is avoided. An implementation of these features is given and the choice of the bivector (a distinguished color plane which parameterizes the Clifford Fourier transform) is discussed. The proposed formalism extends and clarifies the notion of direction of analysis as introduced for the quaternionic Fourier-Mellin moments (Guo and Zhu, 2011). Thus, another set of descriptors invariant under this parameter is defined. Our proposals are tested with the purpose of object recognition on well-known color image databases.

Then the camera calibration can not rely on the initial values of the position and attitude. This paper uses the same data, the same initial values and the same convergence conditions. The experimental results show that the direction cosine method is better than the unit quaternion method.

When using direct inertial measurement to observe the rigid body attitude, it is shown that due to a geometrical obstruction, it is impossible to achieve global asymptotic stability. In fact, for a particular initial condition the tracking error quaternion converges to a pure imaginary quaternion formed by an eigenvector of a characteristic matrix related to the inertial constant and known vectors. Our proposition consists of adding a dynamic signal to force the rigid body to escape from such a situation. The proposed observer-based controller is synthesized based on a single Lyapunov function and a stability analysis shows that the controller stabilizes globally and asymptotically the rigid body attitude at the desired one. The effectiveness of the proposed observer-based controller is confirmed by simulation results.

Traditionally text in different languages is used for efficient retrieval of images; it has several drawbacks such as language constraint and subjectivity of human perception. Content-based image retrieval is a technique which uses visual contents such as color texture and shape to search images from large image databases according to user's desire. Color is the most commonly used feature for content based image retrieval. In many applications color histogram is used to represent extracted color features. The important drawback of usual color histogram based method is that, it does not take image color distribution into consideration and inflexibly partition the color spaces into a fixed number of bins. In this paper we propose a moment-preserving technique based on binary quaternion space for feature extraction. It aims to extract color features according to the image color distribution that effectively reduces the distortion incurred in the feature extraction process. We also propose an efficient clustering based algorithm to compare similarity between two histograms. It is observed that minimizing the distortion incurred in the extraction process can improve the accuracy of retrieval. Our experimental results show that the proposed extraction methods can improve the average retrieval precision rate by a factor of 25% over that of a color histogram based feature extraction method (binning method). It is also observed that, this technique effectively reduces the average retrieval time.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/109487619","afid":"109487619","affilname":"M.G.M's College of Engineering","affiliation-city":"Nanded","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56703460200","authid":"56703460200","authname":"Kottawar V.","surname":"Kottawar","given-name":"Vinayak Gajanan","initials":"V.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"109487619"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24778396700","authid":"24778396700","authname":"Rajurkar A.","surname":"Rajurkar","given-name":"A.

In particular, if Î³G = 0 then every module is a direct summand of a realizable Ä¤*(G)-module. We prove that the converse of that last statement is not true by studying in detail the case of generalized quaternion groups. Suppose that k is a field of characteristic 2 and G is generalized quaternion of order 2n with n â¥ 3. We show that Î³G is non-trivial for all n, but there is an Ä¤*(G)-module detecting this non-triviality if and only if n = 3.

Automatically segmenting non-specific objects is an open problem. To deal with the error segmentation problem of the existing video algorithms under dynamic scenes, we propose a dynamic spatiotemporal saliency model based on the quaternion wavelet transform for video segmentation in this paper, which has the capability of segmenting the salient objects from moving background automatically. The model is a dynamic combination of the temporal attention model and static salient model. In temporal attention model, motion contrast information can be computed from the phase disparity between two consecutive frames. The phase is extracted from quaternionic pyramid. In static salient model, the spatial attention information is computed by an inverse quaternion wavelet transform over the set of scale-weighted center-surround responses. The scale-weighting function has been optimized to better replicate psychophysical data on color appearance. We combine the two kinds of attention information to get the preliminary results and use Grabuct algorithm for the optimization of the result finally. The segmentation and comparison experimental results demonstrate the validity of proposed algorithm.

The parameters in quaternion gyrator transforms and phases serve as encryption keys. By knowing these keys, the original color images can be fully restituted.

The proposed approach grounds the signal processing operations in interpolating curves. Well-chosen interpolating curves are shown to provide a computational framework that is at the same time tractable and information relevant for DTI processing.

A 3D hyper-complex edge detection operator is constructed by combining octonion and gradient operator. We replace every voxel of the volumetric data by one octonion which consist of its gray-level and its 6 neighborhoods' gray-level. Via this the original volumetric data is defined as octonion volumetric data. Similar to the Sobel operator, there are three principal directions (coordinate axes) in 3D hyper-complex edge detection operator, and each element in this operator is a octonion. The operator is circularly convoluted with octonion volumetric data to get the value of matching response. If matched, this voxel is the edge of vessel.

We claim that this approach is an alternative one to overcome the limitations of the extended Kalman filter. The CO processes data from a small inertial/magnetic sensor module containing triaxial angular rate sensors, accelerometers, and magnetometers, without resorting to GPS data. The proposed algorithm incorporates a motion kinematic model and adopts a two-layer filter architecture. In the latter, the Levenberg Marquardt algorithm preprocesses acceleration and local magnetic field measurements, to produce what will be called the system's output. The system's output together with the angular rate measurements will become measurement signals for the CO. In this way, the overall CO design is greatly simplified. The efficiency of the CO is experimentally investigated through an industrial robot and a commercial IMU during human segment motion exercises. These results are promising for human motion applications, in particular future ambulatory monitoring.

The proposed unified scheme arose by studying the characteristics of different orthogonal polynomials. These polynomials are used as kernels in order to form moments, the invariants of which can easily be derived. The resulted scheme permits the usage of any polynomial-like kernel in a unified and consistent way. The resulted moments and moment invariants demonstrate robustness to noisy conditions and high discriminative power. Additionally, in the case of continuous moments, accurate computations take place to avoid approximation errors. Based on this general methodology, the quaternion Tchebichef, Krawtchouk, Dual Hahn, Legendre, orthogonal Fourier-Mellin, pseudo Zernike and Zernike color moments, and their corresponding invariants are introduced.

The significance of phase information in quaternion Bessel-Fourier moments is investigated and an accurate estimation method for rotation angle is described. Furthermore, a new set of invariant descriptors based on the magnitude and the phase information of quaternion Bessel-Fourier moments is derived. Experimental results show that quaternion Bessel-Fourier moments lead to better performance for color image reconstruction than the other quaternion orthogonal moments such as quaternion Zernike moments, quaternion pseudo-Zernike moments and quaternion orthogonal Fourier-Mellin moments. In addition, the angles estimated by the proposed moments are more accurate than those obtained by using other quaternion orthogonal moments. The proposed invariant descriptors show also better robustness to geometric and photometric transformations.

Our approach is driven from the assumption that, if two such sequences describe similar activities, then, consecutive frames (poses) of one sequence are expected to be similar to consecutive frames of the other. The proposed method adopts a quaternion based distance metric to calculate the similarity between poses and an intuitive method for estimating a similarity score between two skeleton motion sequences, based on the structure of a pose correspondence matrix. Our method achieved 99.5% correct activity recognition, when applied on motion capture data, in a classification task consisting of 18 classes of activities.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015331","afid":"60015331","affilname":"Aristotle University of Thessaloniki","affiliation-city":"Thessaloniki","affiliation-country":"Greece"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56285919500","authid":"56285919500","authname":"Fotiadou E.","surname":"Fotiadou","given-name":"Eftychia","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015331"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006823545","authid":"7006823545","authname":"Nikolaidis N.","surname":"Nikolaidis","given-name":"Nikos","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015331"}]}],"authkeywords":"activity recognition | classification","article-number":"7025300","source-id":"21100775289","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
