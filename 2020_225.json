In this paper, we propose two-dimensional quaternion sparse discriminant analysis (2D-QSDA) that meets the requirements of representing RGB and RGB-D images. 2D-QSDA advances in three aspects: 1) including sparse regularization, 2D-QSDA relies only on the important variables, and thus shows good generalization ability to the out-of-sample data which are unseen during the training phase; 2) benefited from quaternion representation, 2D-QSDA well preserves the high order correlation among different image channels and provides a unified approach to extract features from RGB and RGB-D images; 3) the spatial structure of the input images is also retained via the matrix-based processing. We tackle the constrained trace ratio problem of 2D-QSDA by solving a corresponding constrained trace difference problem, which is then transformed into a quaternion sparse regression (QSR) model. Afterward, we reformulate the QSR model to an equivalent complex form to avoid the processing of the complicated structure of quaternions. A nested iterative algorithm is designed to learn the solution of 2D-QSDA in the complex space and then we convert this solution back to the quaternion domain. To improve the separability of 2D-QSDA, we further propose 2D-QSDAw using the weighted pairwise between-class distances. Extensive experiments on RGB and RGB-D databases demonstrate the effectiveness of 2D-QSDA and 2D-QSDAw compared with peer competitors.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024542","afid":"60024542","affilname":"South China University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194871863","authid":"57194871863","orcid":"0000-0001-8827-3991","authname":"Xiao X.","surname":"Xiao","given-name":"Xiaolin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024542"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193685022","authid":"57193685022","orcid":"0000-0003-1970-1993","authname":"Chen Y.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Yongyong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35199869400","authid":"35199869400","orcid":"0000-0002-5648-1160","authname":"Gong Y.","surname":"Gong","given-name":"Yue Jiao","initials":"Y.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024542"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24175343600","authid":"24175343600","orcid":"0000-0002-4487-6384","authname":"Zhou Y.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Yicong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]}],"authkeywords":"2D-QSDA | dimension reduction | Linear discriminant analysis | RGB image | RGB-D image | sparse feature extraction","article-number":"8884667","source-id":"25534","fund-acr":"UM","fund-no":"189/2017/A3","fund-sponsor":"Universidade de Macau","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077218181"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077218181?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077218181&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077218181&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077218181","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85077218181","eid":"2-s2.0-85077218181","dc:title":"Real to H-space autoencoders for theme identification in telephone conversations","dc:creator":"Parcollet T.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio Speech and Language Processing","prism:issn":"23299290","prism:eIssn":"23299304","prism:volume":"28","prism:pageRange":"198-210","prism:coverDate":"2020-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2020","prism:doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2019.2950596","dc:description":"Machine learning (ML) and deep learning with deep neural networks (DNN), have drastically improved the performances of modern systems on numerous spoken language understanding (SLU) related tasks. Since most of current researches focus on new neural architectures to enhance the performances in realistic conditions, few recent works investigated the use of different algebras with neural networks (NN), to better represent the nature of the data being processed. To this extent, quaternion-valued neural networks (QNN) have shown better performances, and an important reduction of the number of neural parameters compared to traditional real-valued neural networks, when dealing with multidimensional signal. Nonetheless, the use of QNNs is strictly limited to quaternion input or output features. This article introduces a new unsupervised method based on a hybrid autoencoder (AE) called real-to-quaternion autoencoder (R2H), to extract a quaternion-valued input signal from any real-valued data, to be processed by QNNs. The experiments performed to identify the most related theme of a given telephone conversation from a customer care service (CCS), demonstrate that the R2H approach outperforms all the previously established models, either real- or quaternion-valued ones, in term of accuracy and with up to four times fewer neural parameters.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031214","afid":"60031214","affilname":"Université d'Avignon et des Pays du Vaucluse","affiliation-city":"Avignon","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002494","afid":"60002494","affilname":"Université McGill","affiliation-city":"Montreal","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/123703934","afid":"123703934","affilname":"Orkis","affiliation-city":"Aix-en-Provence","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193704479","authid":"57193704479","orcid":"0000-0003-0672-1346","authname":"Parcollet T.","surname":"Parcollet","given-name":"Titouan","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"123703934"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031214"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55697911300","authid":"55697911300","orcid":"0000-0002-4427-2468","authname":"Morchid M.","surname":"Morchid","given-name":"Mohamed","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031214"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56331412400","authid":"56331412400","authname":"Bost X.","surname":"Bost","given-name":"Xavier","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"123703934"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603063660","authid":"6603063660","authname":"Linares G.","surname":"Linares","given-name":"Georges","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031214"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35547954100","authid":"35547954100","orcid":"0000-0002-2083-9095","authname":"De Mori R.","surname":"De Mori","given-name":"Renato","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002494"}]}],"authkeywords":"Features extraction | quaternion autoencoder | quaternion neural networks | spoken language understanding","article-number":"8888214","source-id":"21100368801","fund-acr":"ANR","fund-no":"AAPG 2019 ANR-19-CE23-0004-01","fund-sponsor":"Agence Nationale de la Recherche","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85075827069"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85075827069?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85075827069&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85075827069&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85075827069","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85075827069","eid":"2-s2.0-85075827069","dc:title":"Sharp hausdorff-young inequalities for the quaternion fourier transforms","dc:creator":"Lian P.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society","prism:issn":"00029939","prism:eIssn":"10886826","prism:volume":"148","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"697-703","prism:coverDate":"2020-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2020","prism:doi":"10.1090/proc/14735","dc:description":"The quaternion Fourier transforms are powerful tools in modern data analysis, in particular for color image processing.

Then Hirschman's entropy uncertainty principle in the quaternion setting follows from the standard differential approach.","citedby-count":"13","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022149","afid":"60022149","affilname":"Tianjin Normal University","affiliation-city":"Tianjin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56194305100","authid":"56194305100","authname":"Lian P.","surname":"Lian","given-name":"P.","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022149"}]}],"authkeywords":"Hausdorff-Young inequality | Quaternion Fourier transform | Uncertainty principle","source-id":"24677","fund-no":"5RL155","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85075026932"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85075026932?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85075026932&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85075026932&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85075026932","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85075026932","eid":"2-s2.0-85075026932","dc:title":"Low-Rank Quaternion Approximation for Color Image Processing","dc:creator":"Chen Y.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","prism:issn":"10577149","prism:eIssn":"19410042","prism:volume":"29","prism:pageRange":"1426-1439","prism:coverDate":"2020-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2020","prism:doi":"10.1109/TIP.2019.2941319","dc:description":"Low-rank matrix approximation (LRMA)-based methods have made a great success for grayscale image processing. When handling color images, LRMA either restores each color channel independently using the monochromatic model or processes the concatenation of three color channels using the concatenation model. However, these two schemes may not make full use of the high correlation among RGB channels. To address this issue, we propose a novel low-rank quaternion approximation (LRQA) model. It contains two major components: first, instead of modeling a color image pixel as a scalar in conventional sparse representation and LRMA-based methods, the color image is encoded as a pure quaternion matrix, such that the cross-channel correlation of color channels can be well exploited; second, LRQA imposes the low-rank constraint on the constructed quaternion matrix. To better estimate the singular values of the underlying low-rank quaternion matrix from its noisy observation, a general model for LRQA is proposed based on several nonconvex functions. Extensive evaluations for color image denoising and inpainting tasks verify that LRQA achieves better performance over several state-of-the-art sparse representation and LRMA-based methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality.","citedby-count":"74","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024542","afid":"60024542","affilname":"South China University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193685022","authid":"57193685022","authname":"Chen Y.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Yongyong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194871863","authid":"57194871863","authname":"Xiao X.","surname":"Xiao","given-name":"Xiaolin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024542"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24175343600","authid":"24175343600","authname":"Zhou Y.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Yicong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]}],"authkeywords":"image denoising | image inpainting | Low-rank matrix approximation | nonconvex approximation | quaternion singular value decomposition","article-number":"8844978","source-id":"25534","fund-acr":"UM","fund-no":"MYRG2016-00123-FST","fund-sponsor":"Universidade de Macau","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85072975325"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85072975325?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85072975325&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85072975325&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85072975325","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85072975325","eid":"2-s2.0-85072975325","dc:title":"Visual Pose Estimation Based on the DenseNet Network","dc:creator":"Lu L.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering","prism:issn":"18761100","prism:eIssn":"18761119","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789813296855"}],"prism:volume":"593","prism:pageRange":"143-150","prism:coverDate":"2020-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2020","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-981-32-9686-2_18","dc:description":"An end-to-end neural network model based on DenseNet was designed to estimate the pose of the camera in this paper.

In this research, the designed controller is supposed to track the desired time varying attitude of a satellite in the presence of inertia uncertainties and external disturbances. Another restriction for this novel controller is that it should be implementable and more applicable for implementation in a real-time situation. In order to have an accurate and thorough model, the actuators are reaction wheels and the actuator dynamics are modeled in addition to spacecraft dynamics. By modeling actuator dynamics, the control signal is direct current motor voltage, which is the most fundamental control variable, and can be generated easily by a motor driver in practical cases. To achieve a robust tracking of the desired time varying attitude, a sliding mode controller is designed and adaptive techniques are developed based on sliding mode control to overcome the inertia uncertainties and to estimate and compensate for external disturbances. Since the quaternion illustration of equations makes it more straightforward to deal with the mathematical operation in three dimensions, and there are advantages such as singularity rejection, the kinematic equations of the satellite are parameterized using quaternion parameters and a novel control law will be derived by using a new facilitating approach to controller design, which is based on quaternion algebra. Using this approach, it will be easier to deal with tedious mathematical operations and, in contrast with most of the previous studies, the terms corresponding to derivatives of the desired attitude are not neglected and the tracking capability is retained. The global stability of both methods is investigated and proved using the Lyapunov stability theorem.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007751","afid":"60007751","affilname":"Amirkabir University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204116009","authid":"57204116009","authname":"Alipour M.","surname":"Alipour","given-name":"Mohammadreza","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8986450600","authid":"8986450600","orcid":"0000-0002-7086-079X","authname":"Fani Saberi F.","surname":"Fani Saberi","given-name":"Farhad","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23025008800","authid":"23025008800","authname":"Kabganian M.","surname":"Kabganian","given-name":"Mansour","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]}],"authkeywords":"actuator dynamics | adaptive-sliding control | inertia-free | Nonlinear attitude tracking | quaternion algebra","source-id":"14452","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067380013"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067380013?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85067380013&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85067380013&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067380013","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85067380013","eid":"2-s2.0-85067380013","dc:title":"Motion capture data segmentation using Riemannian manifold learning","dc:creator":"Bin W.","prism:publicationName":"Computer Animation and Virtual Worlds","prism:issn":"15464261","prism:eIssn":"1546427X","prism:volume":"31","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 January 2020","prism:doi":"10.1002/cav.1885","dc:description":"Due to the inherent nonlinear nature of data, traditional linear methods have some limitations in finding the intrinsic dimensions of motion capture (Mo-cap) data.

This paper proposes an automatic segmentation method based on geodesics by introducing a Riemannian manifold. We convert Mo-cap data from Euler angles into quaternions, calculate the intrinsic mean of the motion sequence, hemispherize quaternions, and use logarithmic and exponential mapping to calculate geodesic distances instead of quaternions. The experimental results show that the algorithms can achieve automatic segmentation and have a better segmentation effect.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022381","afid":"60022381","affilname":"Beijing Jiaotong University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010606","afid":"60010606","affilname":"East China Jiaotong University","affiliation-city":"Nanchang","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57161232700","authid":"57161232700","orcid":"0000-0002-0409-9496","authname":"Bin W.","surname":"Bin","given-name":"Wang","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022381"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010606"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36666815100","authid":"36666815100","authname":"Weibin L.","surname":"Weibin","given-name":"Liu","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022381"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102932872","authid":"7102932872","authname":"Weiwei X.","surname":"Weiwei","given-name":"Xing","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022381"}]}],"authkeywords":"geodesic | manifold learning | motion capture | Riemannian manifold | segmentation","article-number":"e1885","source-id":"145508","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61370127","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
