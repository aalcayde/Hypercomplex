Firstly, QDWD, which was initially designed for detecting outliers in color images, is used to represent the directional cues in an image. Meanwhile, two low-level priors, namely the color contrast and center cue of the image, are utilized and fused as an object-level cue. Finally, by combining QDWD with object cues, a reliable saliency map of the image can be computed. Experimental results, based on a widely used and openly available database, show that the proposed method is able to produce promising results, compared to other state-of-the-art saliency-detection models.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073726","afid":"60073726","affilname":"Ludong University","affiliation-city":"Yantai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022422","afid":"60022422","affilname":"Ocean University of China","affiliation-city":"Qingdao","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008928","afid":"60008928","affilname":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/22634073600","authid":"22634073600","authname":"Jian M.","surname":"Jian","given-name":"Muwei","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022422"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57200743882","authid":"57200743882","authname":"Qi Q.","surname":"Qi","given-name":"Qiang","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022422"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/22634069200","authid":"22634069200","authname":"Dong J.","surname":"Dong","given-name":"Junyu","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022422"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56366080900","authid":"56366080900","authname":"Sun X.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Xin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022422"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23974770700","authid":"23974770700","authname":"Sun Y.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Yujuan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073726"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55839377100","authid":"55839377100","authname":"Lam K.M.","surname":"Lam","given-name":"Kin Man","initials":"K.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008928"}]}],"article-number":"7820767","source-id":"21100797700","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84995578191"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84995578191?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84995578191&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84995578191&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84995578191","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84995578191","eid":"2-s2.0-84995578191","dc:title":"On harmonic analysis of vector-valued signals","dc:creator":"Sangwine S.J.","prism:publicationName":"Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences","prism:issn":"01704214","prism:eIssn":"10991476","prism:volume":"40","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"22-30","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-15","prism:coverDisplayDate":"15 January 2017","prism:doi":"10.1002/mma.3938","dc:description":"A vector-valued signal in N dimensions is a signal whose value at any time instant is an N-dimensional vector, that is, an element of ℝN. The sum of an arbitrary number of such signals of the same frequency is shown to trace an ellipse in N-dimensional space, that is, to be confined to a plane. The parameters of the ellipse (major and minor axes, represented by N-dimensional vectors; and phase) are obtained algebraically in terms of the directions of oscillation of the constituent signals, and their phases. It is shown that the major axis of the ellipse can always be determined algebraically. That is, a vector, whose value can be computed algebraically (without decisions or comparisons of magnitude) from parameters of the constituent signals, always represents the major axis of the ellipse. The ramifications of this result for the processing and Fourier analysis of signals with vector values or samples are discussed, with reference to the definition of Fourier transforms, particularly discrete Fourier transforms, such as have been defined in several hypercomplex algebras, including Clifford algebras. The treatment in the paper, however, is entirely based on signals with values in ℝN. Although the paper is written in terms of vector signals (which are taken to include images and volumetric images), the analysis clearly also applies to a superposition of simple harmonic motions in N dimensions.

After that, the relation between 2D-HGF and Gauss-Laguerre circular harmonic function (GLCHF) is given. From the aforementioned relation and some derivations, the GLCHF can be proved as the eigenfunction ofDQFT/DRBQFT and its eigenvalues are summarized. These GLCHFs can be used as the basis to perform color image expansion. The expansion coefficients can be used to reconstruct the original color image and as a rotation invariant feature. The GLCHFs can also be applied to color matching applications.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005429","afid":"60005429","affilname":"National Taiwan University","affiliation-city":"Taipei","affiliation-country":"Taiwan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book","subtype":"ch","subtypeDescription":"Book Chapter","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202463605","authid":"7202463605","authname":"Pei S.","surname":"Pei","given-name":"Soo Chang","initials":"S.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005429"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35191694600","authid":"35191694600","authname":"Hsiao Y.","surname":"Hsiao","given-name":"Yu Zhe","initials":"Y.Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005429"}]}],"source-id":"21100899234","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048775905"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048775905?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85048775905&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85048775905&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048775905","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85048775905","eid":"2-s2.0-85048775905","dc:title":"Bingham distribution-based linear filter for online pose estimation","dc:creator":"Srivatsan R.","prism:publicationName":"Robotics: Science and Systems","prism:eIssn":"2330765X","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780992374730"}],"prism:volume":"13","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","dc:description":"Pose estimation is central to several robotics applications such as registration, hand-eye calibration, SLAM, etc. Online pose estimation methods typically use Gaussian distributions to describe the uncertainty in the pose parameters. Such a description can be inadequate when using parameters such as unit-quaternions that are not unimodally distributed. A Bingham distribution can effectively model the uncertainty in unit-quaternions, as it has antipodal symmetry and is defined on a unit-hypersphere. A combination of Gaussian and Bingham distributions is used to develop a linear filter that accurately estimates the distribution of the pose parameters, in their true space. To the best of our knowledge our approach is the first implementation to use a Bingham distribution for 6 DoF pose estimation. Experiments assert that this approach is robust to initial estimation errors as well as sensor noise. Compared to state of the art methods, our approach takes fewer iterations to converge onto the correct pose estimate. The efficacy of the formulation is illustrated with a number of simulated examples on standard datasets as well as real-world experiments.","citedby-count":"18","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104841","afid":"60104841","affilname":"The Robotics Institute","affiliation-city":"Pittsburgh","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55533463500","authid":"55533463500","authname":"Srivatsan R.","surname":"Srivatsan","given-name":"Rangaprasad Arun","initials":"R.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104841"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202574222","authid":"57202574222","authname":"Xu M.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Mengyun","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104841"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56423625000","authid":"56423625000","authname":"Zevallos N.","surname":"Zevallos","given-name":"Nicolas","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104841"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35576235700","authid":"35576235700","authname":"Choset H.","surname":"Choset","given-name":"Howie","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104841"}]}],"source-id":"21100448299","fund-acr":"NSF","fund-no":"IIS-1426655","fund-sponsor":"National Science Foundation","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047881964"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047881964?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85047881964&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85047881964&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047881964","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85047881964","eid":"2-s2.0-85047881964","dc:title":"Color edge detection using quaternion convolution and vector gradient","dc:creator":"BenYoussef N.","prism:publicationName":"VISIGRAPP 2017 - Proceedings of the 12th International Joint Conference on Computer Vision, Imaging and Computer Graphics Theory and Applications","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789897582257"}],"prism:volume":"4","prism:pageRange":"135-139","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","prism:doi":"10.5220/0006229601350139","dc:description":"In this paper, a quaternion-based method is proposed for color image edge detection.

Experimental results demonstrate its capabilities on natural color images.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60060524","afid":"60060524","affilname":"Université de Tunis El Manar, Ecole Nationale d'Ingénieurs de Tunis","affiliation-city":"Tunis","affiliation-country":"Tunisia"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202322308","authid":"57202322308","authname":"BenYoussef N.","surname":"BenYoussef","given-name":"Nadia","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60060524"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23476617600","authid":"23476617600","authname":"Bouzid A.","surname":"Bouzid","given-name":"Aicha","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60060524"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color Image | Edge Detection | Gradient Vector | Quaternion Convolution","source-id":"21100862623","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherhybridgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Hybrid Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047238649"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047238649?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85047238649&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85047238649&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047238649","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85047238649","eid":"2-s2.0-85047238649","dc:title":"Semi-autonomous attitude guidance using relative navigation based on Line of Sight measurements - Aim scenario","dc:creator":"Pellacani A.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC","prism:issn":"00741795","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781510855373"}],"prism:volume":"11","prism:pageRange":"6973-6985","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","dc:description":"The Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM) is an ESA's small mission of opportunity which intends to travel to the binary asteroid Didymos to assess planetary defence capabilities in the context of the AIDA program, in collaboration with NASA, to demonstrate new technologies for future exploration missions to asteroids and to perform scientific observations. The AIM SC is described in the paper, focusing on the vision-based GNC strategy that has significantly evolved during the project and reached a high level of maturity at the end of the Consolidation Phase (post B1). Ground navigation analyses pointed out that for close proximity operations (distances under 20 km) a certain degree of autonomy is required. During the Detailed Characterisation Phase at 10 km, several hyperbolic arcs will be performed. Towards the end of each arc, the ground-predicted SC relative position will not be precise enough to guarantee that Didymain will remain in the camera's FoV (since the FoV of the Aim Framing Camera -AFC- is small and complex slewing and multiple acquisition strategy should be avoided). To cope with that, a semi-autonomous attitude guidance has been developed. This algorithm will apply a delta quaternion to the reference attitude profile provided by ground in order to correct the pointing to the body. This technology has been designed to be easily validated and, at the same time, constrained: the delta quaternion can be limited by thresholds which depend on the ground-predicted navigation dispersion; in case the thresholds are crossed or any failure occurs, the ground-based reference attitude profile will be used. A correct pointing towards the body requires an on-board navigation filter which provides an estimated position of the SC. The GNC prototype was updated to use Line of Sight measurements provided by a centroiding algorithm designed and autocoded in Matlab/Simulink, then validated up to Processor-in-the-loop tests using a flightrepresentative processor (AT697E LEON2-FT @ 80 MHz). The algorithm is based on the correlation of the image with a Lambertian sphere, taking advantage of the almost spherical shape of Didymain. When relative distance to the binary system is below 8 km, the feature tracking algorithm is used. Indeed, in this scenario, the entire primary body is in the FoV, thus the centroiding algorithm cannot be adopted. In this paper a specific case is assessed: the close fly-by for MASCOT-2 delivery (lander included in the payload for AIM's phase B1), tested up to Hardware-in-the-loop with the AFC.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60085129","afid":"60085129","affilname":"OHB System AG","affiliation-city":"Bremen","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60069934","afid":"60069934","affilname":"GMV S.A.","affiliation-city":"Tres Cantos","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031159","afid":"60031159","affilname":"ESTEC -

At the scope, a robust GNC architecture is required, which strictly relies on the navigation system's performance and must assure both high efficiency and safety, i.e. low errors and no collisions with the target satellite. One of the newly explored fields is the optical navigation one. Using passive optical sensors such as cameras can give high benefit in terms of characterization of the observed scene, thus enlarging the consciousness of what is going on in the mission scenario. The present research investigates the development of a filter which can estimate the shape and relative attitude, position and velocity of a non-cooperative, possibly unknown satellite orbiting around Earth, observed by a camera and a LIDAR mounted on a chaser satellite, whose objective is to successfully complete a docking maneuver. The image taken at a certain time is processed, features are extracted from it and matched with the ones extracted from the image at the previous time step. The matched features along with the relative distance measured by the LIDAR are merged inside an unscented Kalman filter, which predicts, updates and improves the state's estimate throughout the iterations. The expedient used in the filter is to give a 3D characterization to the 2D features used as measurements. The filter estimates the 3D coordinates of these points, i.e. the target's shape, in the camera reference frame, whose cinematic differential equations depend on the target's attitude dynamics and the chaser's relative orbital dynamics. Thus, the target's attitude parameters, i.e. the quaternions, and angular velocity vector, the relative position and velocity vectors and the tracked 3D points are all included in the state vector and estimated by the filter. The tracked and estimated 3D point corresponds to a point in the target's body reference frame. Subtracting the 3D point and relative position vectors and rotating the result by means of the estimated target's attitude matrix, the 3D point coordinates are determined in the body reference frame. By doing this for all the tracked points, a 3D map of the target can be built.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032350","afid":"60032350","affilname":"Sapienza Università di Roma","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194609421","authid":"57194609421","authname":"Volpe R.","surname":"Volpe","given-name":"Renato","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603132122","authid":"6603132122","authname":"Palmerini G.B.","surname":"Palmerini","given-name":"Giovanni B.","initials":"G.B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35782355500","authid":"35782355500","authname":"Sabatini M.","surname":"Sabatini","given-name":"Marco","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]}],"source-id":"21100255701","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85042380249"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85042380249?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85042380249&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85042380249&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85042380249","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85042380249","eid":"2-s2.0-85042380249","dc:title":"DOA Estimation of Noncircular Signals Using Quaternions","dc:creator":"Meng T.","prism:publicationName":"International Journal of Antennas and Propagation","prism:issn":"16875869","prism:eIssn":"16875877","prism:volume":"2017","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","prism:doi":"10.1155/2017/9848169","dc:description":"The two-dimensional (2D) direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation problem for noncircular signals using quaternions is considered in this paper.

The proposed methodology (iQSA, improved QSA) extracts features such as the average, variance, homogeneity, and contrast of EEG signals related to motor imagery in a more efficient manner (i.e., by reducing the number of samples needed to classify the signal and improving the classification percentage) compared to the original QSA technique. Specifically, we can sample the signal in variable time periods (from 0.5 s to 3 s, in half-a-second intervals) to determine the relationship between the number of samples and their effectiveness in classifying signals. In addition, to strengthen the classification process a number of boosting-technique-based decision trees were implemented. The results show an 82.30% accuracy rate for 0.5 s samples and 73.16% for 3 s samples. This is a significant improvement compared to the original QSA technique that offered results from 33.31% to 40.82% without sampling window and from 33.44% to 41.07% with sampling window, respectively. We can thus conclude that iQSA is better suited to develop real-time applications.","citedby-count":"13","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033291","afid":"60033291","affilname":"Universidad de Guanajuato","affiliation-city":"Guanajuato","affiliation-country":"Mexico"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019722","afid":"60019722","affilname":"Technische Universität München","affiliation-city":"Munich","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"pubmed-id":"29348744","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57160241800","authid":"57160241800","authname":"Batres-Mendoza P.","surname":"Batres-Mendoza","given-name":"Patricia","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033291"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15837259000","authid":"15837259000","orcid":"0000-0003-4317-0248","authname":"Ibarra-Manzano M.A.","surname":"Ibarra-Manzano","given-name":"Mario A.","initials":"M.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033291"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033291"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57159580000","authid":"57159580000","authname":"Guerra-Hernandez E.I.","surname":"Guerra-Hernandez","given-name":"Erick I.","initials":"E.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033291"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13608761000","authid":"13608761000","authname":"Almanza-Ojeda D.L.","surname":"Almanza-Ojeda","given-name":"Dora L.","initials":"D.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033291"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033291"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57160451700","authid":"57160451700","authname":"Montoro-Sanjose C.R.","surname":"Montoro-Sanjose","given-name":"Carlos R.","initials":"C.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033291"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033291"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194680600","authid":"57194680600","orcid":"0000-0003-3192-5332","authname":"Romero-Troncoso R.J.","surname":"Romero-Troncoso","given-name":"Rene J.","initials":"R.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033291"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033291"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56013673200","authid":"56013673200","orcid":"0000-0001-7530-9027","authname":"Rostro-Gonzalez H.","surname":"Rostro-Gonzalez","given-name":"Horacio","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033291"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033291"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019722"}]}],"article-number":"9817305","source-id":"7000153240","fund-acr":"CONACYT","fund-no":"1961","fund-sponsor":"Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85040607260"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85040607260?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85040607260&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85040607260&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85040607260","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85040607260","eid":"2-s2.0-85040607260","dc:title":"IS and T International Symposium on Electronic Imaging Science and Technology","prism:publicationName":"IS and T International Symposium on Electronic Imaging Science and Technology","prism:eIssn":"24701173","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 22 papers.

Nonetheless, autoencoders reveal little in way of spoken document internal structure by only considering words or topics contained in the document as an isolate basic element, and tend to overfit with small corpus of documents. Therefore, Quaternion Multi-layer Perceptrons (QMLP) have been introduced to capture such internal latent dependencies, whereas denoising autoencoders (DAE) are composed with different stochastic noises to better process small set of documents. This paper presents a novel autoencoder based on both hitherto-proposed DAE (to manage small corpus) and the QMLP (to consider internal latent structures) called \"Quaternion denoising encoder-decoder\" (QDAE). Moreover, the paper defines an original angular Gaussian noise adapted to the specificity of hyper-complex algebra. The experiments, conduced on a theme identification task of spoken dialogues from the DECODA framework, show that the QDAE obtains the promising gains of 3% and 1: 5% compared to the standard real valued denoising autoencoder and the QMLP respectively.","citedby-count":"14","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031214","afid":"60031214","affilname":"Université d'Avignon et des Pays du Vaucluse","affiliation-city":"Avignon","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193704479","authid":"57193704479","authname":"Parcollet T.","surname":"Parcollet","given-name":"Titouan","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031214"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55697911300","authid":"55697911300","authname":"Morchid M.","surname":"Morchid","given-name":"Mohamed","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031214"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603063660","authid":"6603063660","authname":"Linarès G.","surname":"Linarès","given-name":"Georges","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031214"}]}],"authkeywords":"Denoising encoder-decoder neural networks | Neural networks | Quaternion algebra | Spoken language understanding","source-id":"21100212301","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85038260491"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85038260491?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85038260491&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85038260491&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85038260491","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85038260491","eid":"2-s2.0-85038260491","dc:title":"Integrating and securing video, audio and text using quaternion Fourier transform","dc:creator":"Khalil M.I.","prism:publicationName":"International Journal of Communication Networks and Information Security","prism:issn":"20760930","prism:eIssn":"2073607X","prism:volume":"9","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"412-419","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","dc:description":"The rapid growth of communication technology encouraged a rapidly rising demand for internet connectivity. Accordingly, this led to an upsurge in research in the discipline of information security. cryptography plays a significant role in securing and verification of information exchanged via public communication channels. The current paper introduces a novel approach for combining both video, audio and text signals into a single architecture and securing it prior to the process of transmission. The idea behind this approach depends on embedding the color components of each pixel of the video signal in a quaternion number. The fourth component of the quaternion number is occupied with either an audio sample or a textual data. The array of quaternion numbers corresponding to a video frame is converted to the frequency domain, using quaternion Fourier transform, and then multiplied by the quaternion Fourier transform of a digital image. Herby, the selected digital image is used as a complicated secret. The yielded signal is transmitted and when received, both of video, audio and text signals are extracted using simple quaternion mathematics applied to the received signal and a copy of the digital image. A second level of complexity can be added to this approach by applying one of the well-known cryptographic techniques (symmetric or asymmetric) to the samples of the transmitted signal. The suggested approach is implemented using Matlab simulation software and the extracted signals are compared with the original ones using some performance metrics. The obtained results show that the proposed approach is robust and more secure against cryptanalysis attacks without affecting the used bandwidth of the communication channel.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60105146","afid":"60105146","affilname":"Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University","affiliation-city":"Riyadh","affiliation-country":"Saudi Arabia"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195264555","authid":"57195264555","authname":"Khalil M.I.","surname":"Khalil","given-name":"M.

The experimental results show that the proposed watermarking scheme has good robustness against common image attacks such as adding noise, filtering, scaling, JPEG compression, cropping, image adjusting, small angle rotation and so on.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028512","afid":"60028512","affilname":"Civil Aviation University of China","affiliation-city":"Tianjin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55485093700","authid":"55485093700","authname":"Han S.","surname":"Han","given-name":"Shaocheng","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028512"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16178707100","authid":"16178707100","authname":"Yang J.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Jinfeng","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028512"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56319829100","authid":"56319829100","authname":"Wang R.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Rui","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028512"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56425078900","authid":"56425078900","authname":"Jia G.","surname":"Jia","given-name":"Guimin","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028512"}]}],"authkeywords":"Chaotic map | DCT | Image watermarking | QWT | YCbCr space","source-id":"17700155007","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61379102","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85035057659"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85035057659?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85035057659&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85035057659&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85035057659","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85035057659","eid":"2-s2.0-85035057659","dc:title":"2D Hermite-Gaussian and Gauss-Laguerre circular harmonic eigenfunction of the quaternion and reduced biquaternion fourier transform","dc:creator":"Pei S.","prism:publicationName":"Mathematical Research Summaries","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781536122008"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781536120226"}],"prism:volume":"2","prism:pageRange":"285","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 January 2017","dc:description":"The quaternions, reduced biquaternions (RBs) and their respective Fourier transformations, i.e., discrete quaternion Fourier transform (DQFT) and discrete reduced biquaternion Fourier transform (DRBQFT), are very useful for multi-dimensional signal processing and analysis.

In the context of motion generation, each pose can be seen as a constraint that the coupler of a planar four-bar mechanism needs to interpolate or approximate through. We define extended Burmester problem as the one where all types of planar four-bars consisting of dyads of type RR, PR, RP, or PP (R: revolute, P: prismatic) and their dimensions need to be computed for n-geometric-constraints, where a geometric constraint can be an algebraically expressed constraint on the pose, or location of the fixed or moving pivots or something equivalent. In addition, we include both linear and non-linear and exact and approximate constraints. This extension also includes the problems where there is no solution to the classic Burmester problem, but designers would still like to design a four-bar that may come closest to capturing their intent. Such problems are representative of the problems that machine designers grapple with while designing linkage systems for a variety of constraints, which are not merely a set of poses. Recently, we have derived a unified form of geometric constraints of all types of dyads (RR, RP, PR, and PP) in the framework of kinematic mapping and planar quaternions, which map to generalized manifolds (G-manifolds) in the image space of planar displacements. The given poses map to points in the image space. Thus, the problem of synthesis is reduced to minimizing the algebraic error of fitting between the image points and the G-manifolds. We have also created a simple, two-step algorithm using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for the least-squares fitting of the manifolds, which yields a candidate space of solution. By imposing two fundamental quadratic constraints on the candidate solutions, we are able to simultaneously determine both the type and dimensions of the planar four-bar linkages. In this paper, we present 1) a unified approach for solving the extended Burmester problem by showing that all linear- and non-linear constraints can be handled in a unified way without resorting to special cases, 2) in the event of no or unsatisfactory solutions to the synthesis problem certain constraints can be relaxed, and 3) such constraints can be approximately satisfied by minimizing the algebraic fitting error using Lagrange Multiplier method. In doing so, we generalize our earlier formulation and present a new algorithm, which solves new problems including optimal approximate synthesis of Burmester problem with no exact solutions.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026415","afid":"60026415","affilname":"Stony Brook University","affiliation-city":"Stony Brook","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192708470","authid":"57192708470","authname":"Deshpande S.","surname":"Deshpande","given-name":"Shrinath","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026415"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16068884300","authid":"16068884300","authname":"Purwar A.","surname":"Purwar","given-name":"Anurag","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026415"}]}],"source-id":"21100839100","fund-acr":"NSF","fund-no":"CMMI-1563413","fund-sponsor":"National Science Foundation","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85032567364"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85032567364?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85032567364&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85032567364&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85032567364","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85032567364","eid":"2-s2.0-85032567364","dc:title":"Testing of a smart algorithm for gps data prediction to fuse them with the high rate inertial data in a quaternionic mems-INS/GPS integrated navigator","dc:creator":"Grigorie T.L.","prism:publicationName":"International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM","prism:issn":"13142704","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9786197408263"}],"prism:volume":"17","prism:issueIdentifier":"22","prism:pageRange":"593-600","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","prism:doi":"10.5593/sgem2017/22/S09.074","dc:description":"The paper presents a prediction algorithm for the low rate GPS data in order to fuse them with the high rate Inertial Navigation System (INS) data; a major shortcoming in the integration process of the two navigation systems is due to the significant difference in theirs data rates in the reading processes. The algorithm is based on a smart mechanism based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) concept, and includes an adaptive network of fuzzy inference systems. Under the form of a five layer feed-forward network with adaptive and fixed nodes, the ANFIS contains a set of adaptive parameters characterising all the adaptive nodes, which are updated during a training procedure based on training data set. The learning procedure used by ANFIS is a hybrid learning algorithm combining the gradient descent (back propagation) method and the least square method (LSM). The proposed prediction algorithm is actually an extrapolator for the data read from the GPS system at a low rate, which uses at the first step some data from the MEMS-INS navigator to be created and initially trained. After this first step the prediction algorithm operates in the already trained configuration and estimates the samples that are lack from GPS signal for the times synchronized with the MEMS-INS times up. The structure runs and it is kept unchanged until to the time point when the GPS data are received again. Using the currently received GPS valid data and the earlier GPS readings as training data set, the structure is trained again and starting from this time point is used in this new configuration and so on.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002891","afid":"60002891","affilname":"University of Craiova","affiliation-city":"Craova","affiliation-country":"Romania"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14019389000","authid":"14019389000","authname":"Grigorie T.L.","surname":"Grigorie","given-name":"Teodor Lucian","initials":"T.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002891"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191845338","authid":"57191845338","authname":"Corcau C.L.","surname":"Corcau","given-name":"Costinel Laurentiu","initials":"C.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002891"}]}],"authkeywords":"ANFIS | GPS data prediction | Inertial navigation | INS/GPS integration | Miniature inertial sensors | Quaternionic attitude","source-id":"21100274701","fund-no":"PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-2732","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85031029444"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85031029444?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85031029444&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85031029444&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85031029444","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85031029444","eid":"2-s2.0-85031029444","dc:title":"Q-ary LDPC codes based on RA structure for optimization of optical fibre communication system","dc:creator":"Yingying L.","prism:publicationName":"Acta Technica CSAV (Ceskoslovensk Akademie Ved)","prism:issn":"00017043","prism:volume":"62","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"455-464","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","dc:description":"In order to design a better optical fiber communication system, a multivariate LDPC encoding system based on RA structure is proposed.

It is another hotspot in the field of channel coding after Turbo code, and has become the preferred coding scheme for the fourth-generation mobile communications. The main research work is to apply the multiple LDPC codes to the optical fiber communication system on the basis of the four-bit interleaved LDPC coded modulation (BI-LDPC-CM) scheme of binary LDPC codes. So that it can meet the growing demand for high capacity transmission of fiber links. In the aspect of hardware implementation, the encoding and decoding of quaternion LDPC code is realized by FPGA.

Most of the multimodal image fusion algorithms are designed to fuse grayscale images that are produced by different imaging modalities. It is likely that problems of colour distortion and information loss will occur in fused image when source images are fused by using algorithms that are not originally designed to fuse colour images. These problems can be avoided by representing and processing source images as quaternion numbers. Quaternion representation of a colour pixel encodes information of its colour channels on the imaginary parts of a quaternion number and provides the advantage to processing colour information holistically as a vector field. In this paper, we proposed an image fusion algorithm based on Quaternion Principal Component Analysis (QPCA), to fuse multimodal colour medical images. Quaternion principal components are calculated by decomposing quaternion covariance matrix using Quaternion Eigenvalue Decomposition (QEVD). Fusion rule is designed, based on the fusion weights that are extracted from the highly influential principal component. To test the performance of the proposed algorithm, experiments have been performed on six image-sets of multimodal colour images of the brain. Experimental results are compared objectively with existing image fusion algorithms. Comparison results show that the proposed algorithm performed better than existing algorithms in fusing colour medical images.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020620","afid":"60020620","affilname":"Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194768812","authid":"57194768812","authname":"Nawaz Q.","surname":"Nawaz","given-name":"Qamar","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195625516","authid":"57195625516","authname":"Bin X.","surname":"Bin","given-name":"Xiao","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/20236329700","authid":"20236329700","authname":"Weisheng L.","surname":"Weisheng","given-name":"Li","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188859988","authid":"57188859988","authname":"Hamid I.","surname":"Hamid","given-name":"Isma","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]}],"authkeywords":"Colour image fusion | Medical image fusion | Multimodal image fusion | QCPA based image fusion","source-id":"17700155007","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61472055","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85030029486"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85030029486?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85030029486&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85030029486&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85030029486","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85030029486","eid":"2-s2.0-85030029486","dc:title":"Saliency detection via combining global shape and local cue estimation","dc:creator":"Qi Q.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783319677767"}],"prism:volume":"10559 LNCS","prism:pageRange":"325-334","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-67777-4_28","dc:description":"Recently, saliency detection has become a hot issue in computer vision. In this paper, a novel framework for image saliency detection is introduced by modeling global shape and local cue estimation simultaneously. Firstly, Quaternionic Distance Based Weber Descriptor (QDWD), which was initially designed for detecting outliers in color images, is used to model the salient object shape in an image. Secondly, we detect local saliency based on the reconstruction error by using a locality-constrained linear coding algorithm. Finally, by integrating global shape with local cue, a reliable saliency map can be computed and estimated. Experimental results, based on two widely used and openly available databases, show that the proposed method can produce reliable and promising results, compared to other state-of-the-art saliency-detection algorithms.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60122420","afid":"60122420","affilname":"Shandong University of Finance and Economics","affiliation-city":"Jinan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073585","afid":"60073585","affilname":"Linyi University","affiliation-city":"Linyi","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025475","afid":"60025475","affilname":"University of Portsmouth","affiliation-city":"Portsmouth","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022422","afid":"60022422","affilname":"Ocean University of China","affiliation-city":"Qingdao","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57200743882","authid":"57200743882","authname":"Qi Q.","surname":"Qi","given-name":"Qiang","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122420"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022422"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/22634073600","authid":"22634073600","authname":"Jian M.","surname":"Jian","given-name":"Muwei","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122420"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022422"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8981026100","authid":"8981026100","authname":"Yin Y.","surname":"Yin","given-name":"Yilong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122420"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/22634069200","authid":"22634069200","authname":"Dong J.","surname":"Dong","given-name":"Junyu","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022422"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8432944600","authid":"8432944600","authname":"Zhang W.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Wenyin","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073585"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56115992300","authid":"56115992300","authname":"Yu H.","surname":"Yu","given-name":"Hui","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025475"}]}],"authkeywords":"Local cue | Locality-constrained linear coding | QDWD | Saliency detection","source-id":"25674","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"201603045","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028507525"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028507525?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85028507525&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85028507525&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028507525","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85028507525","eid":"2-s2.0-85028507525","dc:title":"Twin deep convolutional neural network for example-based image colorization","dc:creator":"Varga D.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783319646886"}],"prism:volume":"10424 LNCS","prism:pageRange":"184-195","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-64689-3_15","dc:description":"This paper deals with the colorization of grayscale images. Recent papers have shown remarkable results on image colorization utilizing various deep architectures. Unlike previous methods, we perform colorization using a deep architecture and a reference image. Our architecture utilizes two parallel Convolutional Neural Networks which have the same structure. One CNN, which uses the reference image, helps the other CNN in color prediction for the input image. On the other hand, the second CNN, which uses the input image, helps to identify the areas which holds essential information about the color scheme of the scene. Comprehensive experiments and qualitative and quantitative evaluations were conducted on the images of SUN database and on other images. Quantitative evaluations are based on Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and on Quaternion Structural Similarity (QSSIM).","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030035","afid":"60030035","affilname":"Budapest University of Technology and Economics","affiliation-city":"Budapest","affiliation-country":"Hungary"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024855","afid":"60024855","affilname":"Számítástechnikai és Automatizálási Kutatóintézet","affiliation-city":"Budapest","affiliation-country":"Hungary"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55842599000","authid":"55842599000","authname":"Varga D.","surname":"Varga","given-name":"Domonkos","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024855"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030035"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004036382","authid":"7004036382","authname":"Szirányi T.","surname":"Szirányi","given-name":"Tamás","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024855"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030035"}]}],"authkeywords":"Convolutional neural network | Deep learning | Image colorization","source-id":"25674","fund-acr":"OTKA","fund-no":"OTKA 120499","fund-sponsor":"Hungarian Scientific Research Fund","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}}]}}
