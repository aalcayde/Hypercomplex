The proposed model successfully deals with object detection in clutter and distorted environment by using combination of three different techniques - Quaternion correlation, Logarithm mapping and EMACH. Quaternion correlation technique is used to measure colour similarity. Logarithm mapping efficiently provides the constant response in reaction to scale and rotation changes. A quaternion based method needs to be devised to integrate intensity information of three channels by EMACH. By virtue of combining these three novel techniques we can define fully invariant filter. The experimental results, reported herein, show its resilience for practical utilization in the real world scenarios involving distorted environments.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60059937","afid":"60059937","affilname":"National University of Sciences and Technology Pakistan","affiliation-city":"Islamabad","affiliation-country":"Pakistan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189516938","authid":"57189516938","authname":"Sabir D.","surname":"Sabir","given-name":"Dilshad","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60059937"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216103090","authid":"57216103090","authname":"Rehman S.","surname":"Rehman","given-name":"Saad","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60059937"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57184855600","authid":"57184855600","authname":"Hassan A.","surname":"Hassan","given-name":"Ali","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60059937"}]}],"article-number":"7412244","source-id":"21100464306","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962030619"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962030619?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84962030619&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84962030619&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962030619","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84962030619","eid":"2-s2.0-84962030619","dc:title":"Saliency Detection Using Quaternion Sparse Reconstruction","dc:creator":"Zeng Y.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","prism:issn":"15505499","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781467383905"}],"prism:volume":"2015-February","prism:pageRange":"469-476","prism:coverDate":"2016-02-11","prism:coverDisplayDate":"11 February 2016","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICCVW.2015.68","dc:description":"We proposed a visual saliency detection model for color images based on the reconstruction residual of quaternion sparse model in this paper. This algorithm measures saliency of color image region by the reconstruction residual and performs more consistent with visual perception than current sparse models. In current sparse models, they treat the color images as multiple independent channel images and take color image pixel as a scalar entity. Consequently, the important information about interrelationship between color channels is lost during sparse representation. In contrast, the quaternion sparse model treats the color image pixels as a quaternion matrix, completely preserving the inherent color structures during the sparse coding. Therefore, the salient regions can be reliably extracted according to quaternion sparse reconstruction residual since these regions cannot be well approximated using its neighbouring blocks as dictionaries. The proposed saliency detection method achieves better performance on Bruce-Tsotsos dataset and OSIE dataset as compared with traditional sparse reconstruction based models and other state-of-art saliency models. Specifically, our model can achieve higher consistency with human perception without training step and gains higher AUC scores than traditional sparse reconstruction based models.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025084","afid":"60025084","affilname":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57215777346","authid":"57215777346","authname":"Zeng Y.","surname":"Zeng","given-name":"Yi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55695017800","authid":"55695017800","authname":"Xu Y.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Yi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color | Computational modeling | Dictionaries | Encoding | Image color analysis | Image reconstruction | Quaternions","article-number":"7406417","source-id":"110561","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84966292313"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84966292313?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84966292313&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84966292313&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84966292313","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84966292313","eid":"2-s2.0-84966292313","dc:title":"Proceedings - 11th International Conference on Signal-Image Technology and Internet-Based Systems, SITIS 2015","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - 11th International Conference on Signal-Image Technology and Internet-Based Systems, SITIS 2015","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781467397216"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2016-02-05","prism:coverDisplayDate":"5 February 2016","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 124 papers.

By defining quaternion Fourier transform, multidimensional data such as color images can be efficiently and easily process. On the other hand, multi chromatic satellite data appear as a primary source for measuring past trends and monitoring changes in forest carbon stocks. Thus, the processing of these data represents a fundamental challenge. In this work, inspired by the quaternion Fourier transforms, we propose a texture-color descriptor to extract relevant information from multi chromatic satellite images. We also propose a quaternion-based texture model, named FOTO++, to address the aboveground biomass estimation issue. Our proposed model begins by removing noises in the multi chromatic data while preserving the edges of canopies. After that, color texture indices are extracted using discrete form of Quaternion Fourier Transform and finally support vector regression method is used to derive biomass estimation from texture indices. Our texture features are modeled by a vector composed by the radial spectrum coming from the amplitude of quaternion Fourier Transform. We conduct several experiments in order the study the sensitivity of our model to acquisition parameters. We also assess its performances both on synthetic images and on real multi chromatic images of Cameroonian forest. The results provided support that our model is more robust to acquisition parameters than the classical Fourier Texture Ordination model and it is more accurate for aboveground biomass estimates. We stress that similar methodology could be used with quaternion wavelets. These results highlight the potential of quaternion-based approach to study multi chromatic images.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60157993","afid":"60157993","affilname":"Unité de Modélisation Mathématique et Informatique des Systèmes Complexes","affiliation-city":"Bondy","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001422","afid":"60001422","affilname":"Sorbonne Université","affiliation-city":"Paris","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189217136","authid":"57189217136","authname":"Djiongo C.","surname":"Djiongo","given-name":"Cedrigue","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60157993"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001422"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189219985","authid":"57189219985","authname":"Mpong S.M.","surname":"Mpong","given-name":"Serge Moto","initials":"S.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60157993"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001422"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003789416","authid":"7003789416","authname":"Monga O.","surname":"Monga","given-name":"Olivier","initials":"O.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60157993"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001422"}]}],"authkeywords":"aboveground biomass | color image | color-texture | discrete quaternion Fourier transform | multi chromatic satellite image","article-number":"7400547","source-id":"21100457304","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84969136075"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84969136075?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84969136075&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84969136075&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84969136075","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84969136075","eid":"2-s2.0-84969136075","dc:title":"Real-time measurement of radiocarpal joint angle during dart-thrower's movement","dc:creator":"Nguyen N.","prism:publicationName":"BMEiCON 2015 - 8th Biomedical Engineering International Conference","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781467391580"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2016-02-04","prism:coverDisplayDate":"4 February 2016","prism:doi":"10.1109/BMEiCON.2015.7399543","dc:description":"Recently, a renewed attention has been drawn into the dart-thrower's motion as the radiocarpal joint is unique to humans and this is believed to have played a pivotal role in human evolution.

Finally, the simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025578","afid":"60025578","affilname":"Xidian University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56729271200","authid":"56729271200","authname":"Zhao J.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Jichao","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202328081","authid":"7202328081","authname":"Tao H.","surname":"Tao","given-name":"Haihong","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193407612","authid":"57193407612","authname":"Ji R.","surname":"Ji","given-name":"Ru","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57214147193","authid":"57214147193","authname":"Gao Z.","surname":"Gao","given-name":"Zhiqi","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"}]}],"authkeywords":"DOA | Polarization parameters | Quaternion model | Three-component electromagnetic vector sensor","source-id":"96848","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85009354516"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85009354516?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85009354516&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85009354516&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85009354516","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85009354516","eid":"2-s2.0-85009354516","dc:title":"Quaternionic local ranking binary pattern: A local descriptor of color images","dc:creator":"Lan R.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","prism:issn":"10577149","prism:volume":"25","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"566-579","prism:coverDate":"2016-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"February 2016","prism:doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2507404","dc:description":"This paper proposes a local descriptor called quaternionic local ranking binary pattern (QLRBP) for color images. Different from traditional descriptors that are extracted from each color channel separately or from vector representations, QLRBP works on the quaternionic representation (QR) of the color image that encodes a color pixel using a quaternion. QLRBP is able to handle all color channels directly in the quaternionic domain and include their relations simultaneously. Applying a Clifford translation to QR of the color image, QLRBP uses a reference quaternion to rank QRs of two color pixels, and performs a local binary coding on the phase of the transformed result to generate local descriptors of the color image. Experiments demonstrate that the QLRBP outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.","citedby-count":"81","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"pubmed-id":"26672041","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35146229200","authid":"35146229200","authname":"Lan R.","surname":"Lan","given-name":"Rushi","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24175343600","authid":"24175343600","authname":"Zhou Y.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Yicong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404591899","authid":"7404591899","authname":"Tang Y.Y.","surname":"Tang","given-name":"Yuan Yan","initials":"Y.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image processing | Local binary pattern (LBP) | Local descriptor | Quaternionic representation (QR)","article-number":"7350143","source-id":"25534","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962664558"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962664558?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84962664558&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84962664558&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962664558","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84962664558","eid":"2-s2.0-84962664558","dc:title":"Hybrid color and grayscale images encryption scheme based on quaternion hartley transform and logistic map in gyrator domain","dc:creator":"Li J.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of the Optical Society of Korea","prism:issn":"12264776","prism:eIssn":"20936885","prism:volume":"20","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"42-54","prism:coverDate":"2016-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"February 2016","prism:doi":"10.3807/JOSK.2016.20.1.042","dc:description":"A hybrid color and grayscale images encryption scheme based on the quaternion Hartley transform (QHT), the two-dimensional (2D) logistic map, the double random phase encoding (DRPE) in gyrator transform (GT) domain and the three-step phase-shifting interferometry (PSI) is presented. First, we propose a new color image processing tool termed as the quaternion Hartley transform, and we develop an efficient method to calculate the QHT of a quaternion matrix. In the presented encryption scheme, the original color and grayscale images are represented by quaternion algebra and processed holistically in a vector manner using QHT. To enhance the security level, a 2D logistic map-based scrambling technique is designed to permute the complex amplitude, which is formed by the components of the QHT-transformed original images. Subsequently, the scrambled data is encoded by the GT-based DRPE system. For the convenience of storage and transmission, the resulting encrypted signal is recorded as the real-valued interferograms using three-step PSI. The parameters of the scrambling method, the GT orders and the two random phase masks form the keys for decryption of the secret images. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has high security level and certain robustness against data loss, noise disturbance and some attacks such as chosen plaintext attack.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073499","afid":"60073499","affilname":"Hanshan Normal University","affiliation-city":"Chaozhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35069699100","authid":"35069699100","authname":"Li J.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Jianzhong","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073499"}]}],"authkeywords":"Gyrator transform | Image encryption | Quaternion hartley transform | Two-dimensional logistic map","source-id":"19400158589","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962315936"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962315936?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84962315936&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84962315936&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962315936","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84962315936","eid":"2-s2.0-84962315936","dc:title":"Complex and Quaternionic Principal Component Pursuit and Its Application to Audio Separation","dc:creator":"Chan T.S.T.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","prism:issn":"10709908","prism:volume":"23","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"287-291","prism:coverDate":"2016-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 February 2016","prism:doi":"10.1109/LSP.2016.2514845","dc:description":"Recently, the principal component pursuit has received increasing attention in signal processing research ranging from source separation to video surveillance.

Thus, in this letter, we extend principal component pursuit to the complex and quaternionic cases to account for the missing phase information. Specifically, we present both complex and quaternionic proximity operators for the {\\ell -1}-and trace-norm regularizers. These operators can be used in conjunction with proximal minimization methods such as the inexact augmented Lagrange multiplier algorithm. The new algorithms are then applied to the singing voice separation problem, which aims to separate the singing voice from the instrumental accompaniment.

In this method the real part of dual quaternion is used to represent attitude of the sensor, and both the real part and the dual part are used to represent the position of the sensor. The model describing exterior parameters is established by interpolating the position and attitude. To reduce calculation, the simplified spherical linear interpolation algorithm is proposed, and the geometric model is established. In order to calculate the exterior parameters, the collinear equation is linearized at first. Then the virtual observation equations for position parameters are deduced according to the theory of matrix derivative, and the weight of the equation is calculated using error propagation principle. The exterior orientation parameters are calculated iteratively using parameter adjustment with constraints at last. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is reliable and correct, and the precision of parameter estimation is higher than traditional methods using Euler angles or unit quaternion.

We then present a detailed analysis of the properties of the operators, including several different product rules and chain rules. Using the new rules, we derive explicit expressions for the derivatives of a class of regular nonlinear quaternion-valued functions, and prove that the restricted HR gradients are consistent with the gradients in the real domain. As an application, the derivation of the least mean square algorithm and a nonlinear adaptive algorithm is provided.

The accuracy of FR systems is severely affected when two images under consideration for a match, vary in their scale and/or affine angles. The prevalent affine and scale invariant recognition systems have been predominantly developed only for objects, and hence in this study, the authors propose a novel approach for faces based on the affine-SIFT (ASIFT) and two-dimensional principal component analysis (2DPCA) techniques, to accomplish the formidable task of facial image recognition, invariant of scale and affine angles, i.e. the ability to simulate with enough accuracy, all the distortions caused by the differences in resolution and the variation of the camera optical axis direction. In the formulation of ASIFT-2DPCA, they investigate three different variants of 2DPCA: classical 2DPCA, quaternion 2DPCA and sparse 2DPCA to gauge as to which is more effective. The authors'experimentations will demonstrate that the proposed approach can robustly handle affine and scale variations, and hence provide better accuracy and matching performance than the state-of-the-art methodologies.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60097260","afid":"60097260","affilname":"PES University","affiliation-city":"Bengaluru","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36810902100","authid":"36810902100","authname":"Vinay A.","surname":"Vinay","given-name":"A.","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60097260"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56405439800","authid":"56405439800","authname":"Shekhar V.S.","surname":"Shekhar","given-name":"Vinay S.","initials":"V.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60097260"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57056474100","authid":"57056474100","authname":"Akshay Kumar C.","surname":"Akshay Kumar","given-name":"C.","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60097260"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219252936","authid":"57219252936","authname":"Natarajan S.","surname":"Natarajan","given-name":"S.","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60097260"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201420738","authid":"7201420738","authname":"Balasubramanya Murthy K.N.","surname":"Balasubramanya Murthy","given-name":"K.

This adaptation, which has been incorporated into the free open source texture analysis software package MTEX, is capable of segmenting based on subtle and gradual variation as well as on sharp boundaries within the data. FMC has been further modified to group the resulting closed 3D segment boundaries into distinct coherent surfaces based on local normals of a triangulated surface.

In recent years, many image segmentation algorithms have been developed, but they are often very complex and some undesired results occur frequently. In this paper, we propose a pixel classification based color image segmentation using quaternion exponent moments. Firstly, the pixel-level image feature is extracted based on quaternion exponent moments (QEMs), which can capture effectively the image pixel content by considering the correlation between different color channels. Then, the pixel-level image feature is used as input of twin support vector machines (TSVM) classifier, and the TSVM model is trained by selecting the training samples with Arimoto entropy thresholding. Finally, the color image is segmented with the trained TSVM model. The proposed scheme has the following advantages: (1) the effective QEMs is introduced to describe color image pixel content, which considers the correlation between different color channels, (2) the excellent TSVM classifier is utilized, which has lower computation time and higher classification accuracy. Experimental results show that our proposed method has very promising segmentation performance compared with the state-of-the-art segmentation approaches recently proposed in the literature.","citedby-count":"25","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017010","afid":"60017010","affilname":"Liaoning Normal University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"26618250","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972239800","authid":"34972239800","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiang Yang","initials":"X.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56495727800","authid":"56495727800","authname":"Wu Z.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Zhi Fang","initials":"Z.F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192609941","authid":"57192609941","authname":"Chen L.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Liang","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55477452800","authid":"55477452800","authname":"Zheng H.","surname":"Zheng","given-name":"Hong Liang","initials":"H.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972350300","authid":"34972350300","authname":"Yang H.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Hong Ying","initials":"H.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]}],"authkeywords":"Arimoto entropy | Color image segmentation | Quaternion exponent moments | Twin support vector machines","source-id":"24804","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"L2013407","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84939480091"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84939480091?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84939480091&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84939480091&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0165168415002509"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84939480091","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84939480091","eid":"2-s2.0-84939480091","dc:title":"Semi-widely linear estimation of C<sup>η</sup>-proper quaternion random signal vectors under Gaussian and stationary conditions","dc:creator":"Navarro-Moreno J.","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing","prism:issn":"01651684","prism:volume":"119","prism:pageRange":"56-66","prism:coverDate":"2016-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 February 2016","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.sigpro.2015.07.015","pii":"S0165168415002509","dc:description":"Abstract Recursive algorithms for estimating quaternion signal vectors are provided.

Solutions typically require the calculation of the gradient and Hessian. However, real functions of quaternion variables are essentially nonanalytic, which are prohibitive to the development of quaternion-valued learning systems. To address this issue, we propose new definitions of quaternion gradient and Hessian, based on the novel generalized Hamilton-real (GHR) calculus, thus making a possible efficient derivation of general optimization algorithms directly in the quaternion field, rather than using the isomorphism with the real domain, as is current practice. In addition, unlike the existing quaternion gradients, the GHR calculus allows for the product and chain rule, and for a one-To-one correspondence of the novel quaternion gradient and Hessian with their real counterparts. Properties of the quaternion gradient and Hessian relevant to numerical applications are also introduced, opening a new avenue of research in quaternion optimization and greatly simplified the derivations of learning algorithms. The proposed GHR calculus is shown to yield the same generic algorithm forms as the corresponding real-and complex-valued algorithms. Advantages of the proposed framework are illuminated over illustrative simulations in quaternion signal processing and neural networks.","citedby-count":"85","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015150","afid":"60015150","affilname":"Imperial College London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009509","afid":"60009509","affilname":"Northeast Normal University","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005244","afid":"60005244","affilname":"Southeast University","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003353","afid":"60003353","affilname":"Harbin Engineering University","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23394265800","authid":"23394265800","authname":"Xu D.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Dongpo","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009509"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003353"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25958477900","authid":"25958477900","authname":"Xia Y.","surname":"Xia","given-name":"Yili","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006513328","authid":"7006513328","authname":"Mandic D.","surname":"Mandic","given-name":"Danilo P.","initials":"D.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]}],"authkeywords":"Backpropagation | generalized Hamilton-real (GHR) calculus | nonlinear adaptive filtering | quaternion gradient | quaternion least mean square (QLMS) | quaternion optimization | real-Time recurrent learning.","article-number":"7124503","source-id":"21100235616","fund-acr":"EPSRC","fund-no":"EP/H026266/1","fund-sponsor":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84966670310"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84966670310?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84966670310&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84966670310&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84966670310","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84966670310","eid":"2-s2.0-84966670310","dc:title":"Scale-space saliency detection in combined color space","dc:creator":"Xiang D.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - 2015 Chinese Automation Congress, CAC 2015","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781467371896"}],"prism:pageRange":"726-731","prism:coverDate":"2016-01-13","prism:coverDisplayDate":"13 January 2016","prism:doi":"10.1109/CAC.2015.7382593","dc:description":"Interesting objects can appear more salient either in the RGB color space or in the Lab color space depending on the input images case by case. With this observation, saliency detection in a combined color space is proposed and investigated in this paper. In particular, the adaptively-centered Hypercomplex Fourier transform (A-HFT) algorithm in the RGB color space proposed in a recent work is performed for saliency detection in the combined color space. First, the input image is transformed into the frequency domain by the Hypercomplex Fourier transform in terms of its RGB and Lab representations, respectively. Next, a set of low-pass Gaussian kernels are employed to perform a scale-space analysis, resulting in a series of RGB and Lab saliency maps. Finally, the optimal saliency maps in the two color spaces are determined by minimum entropy, and the better one (which has lower entropy) is taken as the outcome of the combined color space. The efficiency of the new algorithm is evaluated by extensive experimental results.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010432","afid":"60010432","affilname":"Soochow University","affiliation-city":"Suzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57089855500","authid":"57089855500","authname":"Xiang D.","surname":"Xiang","given-name":"Dan","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010432"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8366198400","authid":"8366198400","authname":"Zhong B.","surname":"Zhong","given-name":"Baojiang","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010432"}]}],"authkeywords":"center bias | combined color space | minimum entropy | Saliency detection | scale-space | unmanned monitoring machine","article-number":"7382593","source-id":"21100457334","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85125605541"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85125605541?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85125605541&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85125605541&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85125605541","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85125605541","eid":"2-s2.0-85125605541","dc:title":"Optimized fuzzy-quaternion attitude control of satellite in large maneuver","dc:creator":"Ghadiri H.","prism:publicationName":"14th International Conference on Space Operations, 2016","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781624104268"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2016-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2016","prism:doi":"10.2514/6.2016-2552","dc:description":"In this paper a fuzzy-quaternion controller is designed for attitude control of a satellite, then the fuzzy memberships are tuned in an intelligent way by using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm.

To evaluate the controller robustness in presence of uncertainties, 20 percent uncertainties were considered in inertias of momentum through the simulations. The simulation results show that the optimized fuzzy logic controller (OFLC) can control the satellite in large maneuvers in desirable time.

The primary mission objectives are to provide high resolution images of earth observation. This paper represents the attitude control performance of Dubaisat-2 in space focusing on the launch & early operation results. The Dubaisat-2 has implemented reaction wheels, gyros, star trackers, sun sensors, magnetometers and magnetic torquer for agile and accurate attitude control purposes. The attitude control hardware and flight control software support various operations and maneuvers for efficient and advanced imaging missions. The required attitude pointing accuracy of 0.12 deg (3 sigma) and the stability of 0.009 deg/sec (3 sigma) are verified by in-orbit performance analysis. For 3-axis attitude control and stabilization of a rigid spacecraft, quaternion feedback law is applied in Dubaisat-2 and settling time to set PD gain is auto-scheduled in on-board software. The conservative pyramidal configuration of four reaction wheel and additional one reaction wheel is applied and continuous wheel momentum dumping is performed by using magnetic torquer. The control torque distribution optimization is based on a null space solution. Dubaisat-2 is designed to support the imaging functions such as single, multi strip and single-pass stereo imaging. For the geometric and radiometric calibration, stars and moon imaging operations are also performed for value-added image product. In this paper, the overview of the DubaiSat-2 attitude control system is described with focusing on the launch & early operation results. Lessons learned from flying experiences and analysis results will contributes to sustainable development in Satrec Initiative.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60114150","afid":"60114150","affilname":"Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre","affiliation-city":"Dubai","affiliation-country":"United Arab Emirates"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/127086698","afid":"127086698","affilname":"Satrec Initiative","affiliation-city":"Daejeon","affiliation-country":"South Korea"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/117077968","afid":"117077968","affilname":"Systems Department","affiliation-city":"Daejeon","affiliation-country":"South Korea"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190438731","authid":"57190438731","authname":"Koh D.","surname":"Koh","given-name":"Dongwook","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"117077968"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190438631","authid":"57190438631","authname":"Alsayegh A.","surname":"Alsayegh","given-name":"Amer","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60114150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55706773900","authid":"55706773900","authname":"Lee H.","surname":"Lee","given-name":"Hyunwoo","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"127086698"}]}],"source-id":"21100469904","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85088202388"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85088202388?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85088202388&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85088202388&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85088202388","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85088202388","eid":"2-s2.0-85088202388","dc:title":"Adaptive augmenting control of satellite attitude for object tracking from relative orbit","dc:creator":"Franquiz F.J.","prism:publicationName":"AIAA/AAS Astrodynamics Specialist Conference, 2016","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781624104459"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2016-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2016","prism:doi":"10.2514/6.2016-5583","dc:description":"This paper presents advances in direct adaptive control, particularly the design and analysis of an adaptive augmenting controller (AAC) applied to spacecraft attitude control. The control objective is tracking a resident space object by a chaser spacecraft from a circularized relative orbit during proximity operations. The rigid body motion of the chaser is parameterized using quaternion kinematics to produce bounded and periodic attitude trajectory profiles for a natural relative motion with constant angular rates. Linearization about the constant relative angular rates results in a linear time invariant, multiple-input multiple-output dynamical system. By considering the corresponding periodic attitude profiles as persistent harmonic disturbances, adaptive disturbance accommodation is used within the AAC to condition the controller to track the reference signal and improve overall performance. The stability of the system is analyzed during the design process and confirmed through numerical simulations. The performance of the system is evaluated for a target tracking scenario involving a 6U CubeSat capable of 3 degrees-of-freedom rotational maneuvering; the satellite is simultaneously subjected to environmental sinusoidal disturbances. The results presented show improved tracking performance and input reduction in comparison to a fixed-gain control system for both, linear and non-linear plants.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028872","afid":"60028872","affilname":"Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University","affiliation-city":"Daytona Beach","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56237464000","authid":"56237464000","authname":"Franquiz F.J.","surname":"Franquiz","given-name":"Francisco J.","initials":"F.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028872"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57020778700","authid":"57020778700","authname":"Sánchez L.A.","surname":"Sánchez","given-name":"Luis A.","initials":"L.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028872"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13410148700","authid":"13410148700","authname":"Udrea B.","surname":"Udrea","given-name":"Bogdan","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028872"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004861131","authid":"7004861131","authname":"Balas M.","surname":"Balas","given-name":"Mark","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028872"}]}],"source-id":"21100786191","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85088065212"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85088065212?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85088065212&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85088065212&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85088065212","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85088065212","eid":"2-s2.0-85088065212","dc:title":"Separation of a single mode of rayleigh waves using quaternion SVD in verticallyheterogeneous media","dc:creator":"Sajeva A.","prism:publicationName":"22nd European Meeting of Environmental and Engineering Geophysics, Near Surface Geoscience 2016","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2016-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2016","prism:doi":"10.3997/2214-4609.201602088","dc:description":"I propose a wave-separation method that separates a single Rayleigh-wave mode from body waves and from other modes, using quaternions to represent the multi-component seismic data recorded by an array of vector-sensors. This method decomposes the signal into narrow-frequency bands, which are subjected to both a velocity correction and a polarisation correction. The aim of these corrections is to reduce the mode of interest to a quasi-monochromatic wave packet with infinite apparent velocity and quasi-circular polarisation. Once written in quaternion notation, I refer to this wave packet as \"quaternion brick\". It can be proved that this quaternion brick maps into the first quaternion eigenimage of the quaternion SVD (QSVD). I apply this method to vertically-heterogeneous elastic models. The method seems to correctly extract the selected Rayleigh-wave mode and to separate it from body waves. The separation between different modes is more challenging. It results that, when two modes interfere in the near-offset portion, a more accurate separation can be obtained by characterising the mode of interest in the far-offset portion and then extrapolating it in the near-offset portion (where the two modes overlap) using the properties of the right singular vector of the QSVD.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028868","afid":"60028868","affilname":"Università di Pisa","affiliation-city":"Pisa","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35235033000","authid":"35235033000","authname":"Sajeva A.","surname":"Sajeva","given-name":"A.","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028868"}]}],"source-id":"21100790323","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85086950238"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85086950238?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85086950238&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85086950238&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85086950238","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85086950238","eid":"2-s2.0-85086950238","dc:title":"Recursive filtering of star tracker data","dc:creator":"Darling J.E.","prism:publicationName":"AIAA/AAS Astrodynamics Specialist Conference, 2016","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781624104459"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2016-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2016","prism:doi":"10.2514/6.2016-5672","dc:description":"Star trackers typically obtain attitude information about a vehicle by imaging a portion of the sky and matching the observed stars to those in a known star catalog. The light gathered from each star is typically assumed to be Gaussian-distributed in the image plane, such that the measured direction to each star is the mean of the Gaussian. The measured direction to the star, along with its known direction in some reference frame, is then used to determine the attitude and its associated uncertainty of the vehicle at the epoch in which the image was taken. This data is then processed by an attitude filter to fuse the new information with a prior estimate. This paper investigates the application of the multiplicative extended Kalman filter (MEKF) filter for attitude determination using star tracker measurements. Two MEKFs are considered: one processes the outputs of the star tracker assuming that a quaternion measurement is returned, and the other directly processes the measured pixel locations. It is found that both MEKFs perform nearly identically and provide a statistically consistent solution with a Monte Carlo analysis.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024728","afid":"60024728","affilname":"Missouri University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Rolla","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009254","afid":"60009254","affilname":"Purdue University","affiliation-city":"West Lafayette","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113410136","afid":"113410136","affilname":"School of Aeronautics and Astronautics","affiliation-city":"Fort Worth","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55758084300","authid":"55758084300","authname":"Darling J.E.","surname":"Darling","given-name":"Jacob E.","initials":"J.E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024728"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191972232","authid":"57191972232","authname":"Houtz N.","surname":"Houtz","given-name":"Nathan","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009254"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113410136"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189002581","authid":"57189002581","authname":"Frueh C.","surname":"Frueh","given-name":"Carolin","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009254"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113410136"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26430604500","authid":"26430604500","authname":"Demars K.J.","surname":"Demars","given-name":"Kyle J.","initials":"K.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024728"}]}],"source-id":"21101005644","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047763832"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047763832?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85047763832&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85047763832&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047763832","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85047763832","eid":"2-s2.0-85047763832","dc:title":"Fast feature-less quaternion-based particle swarm optimization for object pose estimation from RGB-D images","dc:creator":"Toscana G.","prism:publicationName":"British Machine Vision Conference 2016, BMVC 2016","prism:volume":"2016-September","prism:pageRange":"113.1-113.11","prism:coverDate":"2016-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2016","prism:doi":"10.5244/C.30.113","dc:description":"We present a novel quaternion-based formulation of Particle Swarm Optimization for pose estimation which, differently from other approaches, does not rely on image features or machine learning. The quaternion formulation avoids the gimbal lock problem, and the objective function is based on raw 2D depth information only, under the assumption that the object region is segmented from the background. This makes the algorithm suitable for pose estimation of objects with large variety in appearance, from lack of texture to strong textures, for the task of robotic grasping. We find candidate object regions using a graph-based image segmentation approach that integrates color and depth information, but the PSO is agnostic to the segmentation algorithm used. The algorithm is implemented on GPU, and the nature of the objective function allows high parallelization. We test the approach on different publicly available RGB-D object datasets, discuss the results and compare them with other existing methods.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012162","afid":"60012162","affilname":"Politecnico di Torino","affiliation-city":"Turin","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57035380900","authid":"57035380900","authname":"Toscana G.","surname":"Toscana","given-name":"Giorgio","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012162"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/53867082700","authid":"53867082700","authname":"Rosa S.","surname":"Rosa","given-name":"Stefano","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012162"}]}],"source-id":"21100862463","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047196691"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047196691?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85047196691&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85047196691&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047196691","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85047196691","eid":"2-s2.0-85047196691","dc:title":"Disguised face identification using multi-modal features in a quaternionic form","dc:creator":"Apostolopoulos G.","prism:publicationName":"IET Seminar Digest","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781785612220"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781785612343"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781785612831"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781785613104"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781785613173"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781785614002"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781785614019"}],"prism:volume":"2016","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2016-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2016","prism:doi":"10.1049/ic.2016.0074","dc:description":"Disguised face recognition is considered as very challenging and important problem in the face recognition field. A disguised face recognition algorithm is proposed using quaternionic representation. The feature extraction module is accomplished with a new method, decomposing each face image into a linear decomposition of a set of localized basis functions. The feature sets, related to Shapelets and Gabor filters, are used to encode the image data. The coefficients of the integral transformations are fused and presented in quaternionic representation to the Classification module. This study shows that the proposed algorithm can achieve high recognition results under disguised conditions.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031155","afid":"60031155","affilname":"University of Patras","affiliation-city":"Rio","affiliation-country":"Greece"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019160","afid":"60019160","affilname":"Syddansk Universitet","affiliation-city":"Odense","affiliation-country":"Denmark"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004169705","authid":"7004169705","authname":"Apostolopoulos G.","surname":"Apostolopoulos","given-name":"G.","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031155"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15077522200","authid":"15077522200","authname":"Tzitzilonis V.","surname":"Tzitzilonis","given-name":"V.","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031155"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16063927900","authid":"16063927900","authname":"Kappatos V.","surname":"Kappatos","given-name":"V.","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019160"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35612928000","authid":"35612928000","authname":"Dermatas E.","surname":"Dermatas","given-name":"E.","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031155"}]}],"authkeywords":"Disguised face recognition | Gabor filters | Quaternions | Shapelets","source-id":"5100154507","fund-acr":"NSF","fund-no":"0339122","fund-sponsor":"National Science Foundation","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047187197"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047187197?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85047187197&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85047187197&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047187197","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85047187197","eid":"2-s2.0-85047187197","dc:title":"Exploiting color cues to improve person re-identification","dc:creator":"Chahla C.","prism:publicationName":"IET Seminar Digest","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781785612220"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781785612343"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781785612831"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781785613104"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781785613173"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781785614002"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781785614019"}],"prism:volume":"2016","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2016-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2016","prism:doi":"10.1049/ic.2016.0089","dc:description":"Person re-identification is essentially the task of recognizing the same person across different non-overlapping cameras. It has been intensively studied due to its critical role for many security applications of video surveillance. In this paper we exploit the low-level color information in two different aspects, showing the strength provided by colors to increase the accuracy of classification. First, we propose a discriminant embedding for the feature descriptor, which takes into consideration all color components at one time using the quaternions. Second, we propose to assign each individual to a color name in order to increase the discrimination of our descriptor with a semantic analysis. Experiments are carried out on the highly challenging VIPeR dataset. Comparison with some state-of-the-art methods is provided and the proposed method shows better performance even with a simple metric learning method.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104285","afid":"60104285","affilname":"Ikerbasque, Basque Foundation for Science","affiliation-city":"Bilbao","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60068774","afid":"60068774","affilname":"Université Libanaise","affiliation-city":"Beirut","affiliation-country":"Lebanon"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027856","afid":"60027856","affilname":"Universidad del Pais Vasco","affiliation-city":"Leioa","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023736","afid":"60023736","affilname":"Université de Technologie de Troyes","affiliation-city":"Troyes","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57160103400","authid":"57160103400","authname":"Chahla C.","surname":"Chahla","given-name":"C.","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023736"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60068774"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16176538800","authid":"16176538800","authname":"Snoussi H.","surname":"Snoussi","given-name":"H.","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023736"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57210156007","authid":"57210156007","authname":"Abdallah F.","surname":"Abdallah","given-name":"F.","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60068774"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55967501800","authid":"55967501800","authname":"Dornaika F.","surname":"Dornaika","given-name":"F.","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027856"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104285"}]}],"authkeywords":"Discriminant embedding | Person re-identification | Quaternion local binary pattern | Semantic analysis","source-id":"5100154507","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
