Using the direction information of external information, the proposed method prevents unnecessarily increasing the measurement noise covariance corresponding to the accelerometer output, which is not affected by external acceleration.

Reduced biquaternions (RB), which are an extension of the complex numbers, are used to characterize the color information. Multi-Channel wavelet filtering is used to extract the texture information at various scales from the LUV color space. Each wavelet channel (subband) is represented by a commutative Reduced Biquaternion representation. These color and texture descriptors are merged in the frequency domain in-order to reduce the time complexity of this convolution process. Amplitude features are computed from each color-texture channel. Every pixel in the image is described by a feature vector, formed by grouping the features of all the channels. Finally, SOM (Self-organizing Map) with adaptive learning rate is used to label the pixels. The proposed segmentation algorithm is experimented on some natural images from Berkeley segmentation database. The obtained results substantiate the feasibility of the method, whose performance is compared, for evaluation, with the popular JSEG algorithm and also with human-assisted segmentations.

Therefore, a digital watermarking technology was proposed in the international community, what can effectively protect the security of digital products and copyright. In recent years, digital watermarking technology, especially digital watermarking of color images, has aroused great international interest and attention.

Since the process is complex, it is limited in the practical applications. A novel estimation algorithm of DOA is proposed based on quaternion data model in this paper. The signal output model based on quaternion is set for electromagnetic loop sensors. Based on quaternion data model, there are only DOA parameters but not polarization parameters in the direction matrix. Thus, the high-dimensional searching process is replaced by low-dimensional process in the proposed DOA estimation algorithm, so that the computation is heavily reduced.

In this work, we show that these definitions satisfy some important properties, which include the invariance to quaternion linear transformations and right Clifford translations, as well as some clear connections with the case of proper complex vectors. Moreover, we introduce a new kind of quaternion properness, which clearly relates the two previous definitions, and propose three measures for the degree of improperness of a quaternion vector. The proposed measures are based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two zero-mean quaternion Gaussian distributions, one of them with the actual augmented covariance matrix, and the other with its closest proper version. These measures allow us to quantify the entropy loss due to the improperness of the quaternion vector, and they admit an intuitive geometrical interpretation based on Kullback-Leibler projections onto sets of proper augmented covariance matrices.

Firstly, the widely linear quaternionic Wiener solution is introduced which uses the 'augmented' input and weight vectors and thus makes full use of the available second order information. Next, the widely linear quaternion recursive least squares (WL-QRLS) algorithm is derived and is shown to exhibit enhanced transient and steady state properties as compared to the standard widely linear quaternion least mean square (WL-QLMS).

It is shown that the QZMs can be obtained via the conventional Zernike moments of each channel.

This paper proposes an efficient algorithm for removing Gaussian noise from corrupted image by using quaternion wavelet transform and bivariate shrinkage function. The image is decomposed by quaternion wavelet transform to obtain the quaternion coefficients in each sub-band. Then a bivariate shrinkage function filter by using the maximum a posteriori is used to model the statistical dependencies among intra-scale quaternion coefficients. The proposed algorithm is compared with other denoising techniques in terms of PSNR. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other denoising algorithms significantly.

In this framework, we handle the design of kernels involving the Clifford or geometric product. In this approach, one redefines the optimization variables as multivectors. This allows us to have a multivector as output. Therefore, we can represent multiple classes according to the dimension of the geometric algebra in which we work. We show that one can apply CSVM for classification and regression and also to build a recurrent CSVM. The CSVM is an attractive approach for the multiple input multiple output processing of high-dimensional geometric entities. We carried out comparisons between CSVM and the current approaches to solve multiclass classification and regression. We also study the performance of the recurrent CSVM with experiments involving time series. The authors believe that this paper can be of great use for researchers and practitioners interested in multiclass hypercomplex computing, particularly for applications in complex and quaternion signal and image processing, satellite control, neurocomputation, pattern recognition, computer vision, augmented virtual reality, robotics, and humanoids.

A data acquisition device is employed to capture the palmprint images under Red, Green, Blue and near-infrared (NIR) illuminations in less than 1s. QPCA is used to extract features of multispectral palmprint images. The dissimilarity between two palmprint images is measured by the Euclidean distance. The experiment shows that a higher recognition rate can be achieved when we use QPCA. Given 3000 testing samples from 500 palms, the best GAR is 98.13%.

The attitude is represented by quaternion, and the local error is represented by the modified Rodrigues parameters. Gaussian mixture model is used to approximate the posterior density of the state, and the state update is carried out by sampling based methods. Meanwhile Expectation Maximization algorithm is introduced to avoid the collapsing of Gaussian mixture terms. The efficiency of Gaussian sum particle filter estimator for spacecraft attitude is validated by numerical simulation.

General full-reference (FR) QA criteria such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and mean squared error (MSE) do not accord well with human subjective assessment. Some QA indices that consider human visual sensitivity, such as mean structural similarity (MSSIM) with structural sensitivity, visual information fidelity (VIF) with statistical sensitivity, etc., were proposed in view of the differences between reference and distortion frames on a pixel or local level. However, they ignore the role of human visual attention (HVA). Recently, some new strategies with HVA have been proposed, but the methods extracting the visual attention are too complex for real-time realization. We take advantage of the phase spectrum of quaternion Fourier transform (PQFT), a very fast algorithm we previously proposed, to extract saliency maps of color images or videos. Then we propose saliency-based methods for both image QA (IQA) and video QA (VQA) by adding weights related to saliency features to these original IQA or VQA criteria. Experimental results show that our saliency-based strategy can approach more closely to human subjective assessment compared with these original IQA or VQA methods and does not take more time because of the fast PQFT algorithm.

For many pixels, we can not absolutely classify them as noisy or noise-free, but can only describe them using the likelihood that they are corrupted by impulsive noise. Based on this consideration, we present a new filtering solution to removing impulsive noise from color images. The proposed method first utilizes the unit transforms of quaternions to represent the chromaticity difference of two color pixels, and then divides the image into noise-free and possible noisy pixels. Finally it performs adaptive weighted vector median filtering operations on only the possible noisy pixels to suppress noise. The new weighting mechanism is based on a joint spatial/quaternionchromaticity criterion, which ensures that pixels with different contamination likelihoods have different contributions to the filter's output. The extensive simulation results indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms some other well-known multichannel filtering techniques.

Dual quaternions can be used to represent rigid-body motions, both finite screw motions and infinitesimal motions, called twists. The finite screws are elements of the group of rigid-body motions while the twists are elements of the Lie algebra of this group. The group of rigid-body displacements are represented by dual quaternions satisfying a simple relation in the algebra. The space of group elements can be though of as a six-dimensional quadric in seven-dimensional projective space, this quadric is known as the Study quadric. The twists are represented by pure dual quaternions which satisfy a degree 4 polynomial relation. This means that analytic maps between the Lie algebra and its Lie group can be written as a cubic polynomials. In order to find these polynomials a system of mutually annihilating idempotents and nilpotents is introduced. This system also helps find relations for the inverse maps. The geometry of these maps is also briefly studied. In particular, the image of a line of twists through the origin (a screw) is found. These turn out to be various rational curves in the Study quadric, a conic, twisted cubic and rational quartic for the maps under consideration.
