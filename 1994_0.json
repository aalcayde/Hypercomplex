Since many remote sensing imaging devices use the linear pushbroom scanning model, trajectory deviation during the image scanning period causes geometric distortion in the imagery. Unless actual satellite trajectory during imaging is modeled, accurate rectification of imagery is impossible. A means of recovering the trajectory from known satellite motion is presented here. Rotational motion is usually sensed by gyroscopes which measure angular velocity. Translational motion can be determined in several ways including telemetry analysis and linear accelerometers. In more recent satellites GPS receivers may be used to determine motion data. We show how to interpolate and subsequently integrate angular velocity to yield a rotational trajectory. The screw, implemented as a dual-number quaternion, is shown to be a suitable parameterization of motion to model the trajectory as a kinematic chain. This representation is useful for image geometry analysis and hence for correction of image distortion. Applications of this parameterization to scanned image resampling and rectification are mentioned.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011149","afid":"60011149","affilname":"Trinity College Dublin","affiliation-city":"Dublin","affiliation-country":"Ireland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603016809","authid":"6603016809","authname":"Shevlin F.","surname":"Shevlin","given-name":"Fergal P.","initials":"F.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011149"}]}],"source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0028734505"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0028734505?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0028734505&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0028734505&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0028734505","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0028734505","eid":"2-s2.0-0028734505","dc:title":"Realization of complex transfer functions using hypercomplex digital filters","dc:creator":"Toyoshima H.","prism:publicationName":"National Conference Publication - Institution of Engineers, Australia","prism:issn":"03136922","prism:volume":"1","prism:issueIdentifier":"94 /9","prism:pageRange":"293-298","prism:coverDate":"1994-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1994","dc:description":"Complex signal systems have been used for some time to manipulate complex signals such as analytic signals or so.

Hypercomplex numbers are generally defined as numbers with more than two real elements. We employ one kind of hypercomplex numbers, that is called bicomplex numbers, and propose an all-pass type filter structure with bicomplex coefficients. Using the proposed structure, a power complementary filter pair with complex coefficients can be realized with a single bicomplex filter.

Unfortunately, quaternion rotation is often left as an advanced topic in computer graphics education due to difficulties in portraying the four-dimensional space of the quaternions. One tool for overcoming these obstacles is the quaternion demonstrator, a physical visual aid consisting primarily of a belt. Every quaternion used to specify a rotation can be represented by fixing one end of the belt and rotating the other. Multiplication of quaternions is demonstrated by the composition of rotations, and the resulting twists in the belt depict visually how quaternions interpolate rotation. This article introduces to computer graphics the exponential notation that mathematicians have used to represent unit quaternions. Exponential notation combines the angle and axis of the rotation into concise quaternion expression. This notation allows the article to present more clearly a mechanical quaternion demonstrator consisting of a ribbon and a tag, and develop a computer simulation suitable for interactive educational packages. Local deformations and the belt trick are used to minimize the ribbon's twisting and simulate a natural-appearing interactive quaternion demonstrator. © 1994, ACM.

The method, referred to as expansive coding, is a representation methodology which makes complicated combinatorial optimisation tasks easier to solve for a GA. Using this technique, the representation, operators and fitness function used by the GA become more complicated, but the search space becomes less epistatic, and therefore easier for the GA to tackle. This reduction in epistasis (interaction between parameters) is essential if the difficult task of complexity reduction is to be successfully achieved. Expansive coding spreads the task's complexity more evenly among the operators, fitness function and search space. We demonstrate how this technique can be applied to two cases of reduction of complexity of algorithms: a multiplier for quaternion numbers, and a Walsh transform computation. We suggest why the technique is more successful on the former task than the latter.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023998","afid":"60023998","affilname":"Cardiff University","affiliation-city":"Cardiff","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020650","afid":"60020650","affilname":"University of Bristol","affiliation-city":"Bristol","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101822522","authid":"7101822522","authname":"Beasley D.","surname":"Beasley","given-name":"David","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023998"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203057734","authid":"57203057734","authname":"Bull D.R.","surname":"Bull","given-name":"David R.","initials":"D.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020650"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7501380942","authid":"7501380942","authname":"Martin R.R.","surname":"Martin","given-name":"Ralph R.","initials":"R.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023998"}]}],"source-id":"25674","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0028540152"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0028540152?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0028540152&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0028540152&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-0031320394901260"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0028540152","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0028540152","eid":"2-s2.0-0028540152","dc:title":"Rigid motion and structure from several sets of parallel lines in a monocular image sequence","dc:creator":"Pei S.","prism:publicationName":"Pattern Recognition","prism:issn":"00313203","prism:volume":"27","prism:issueIdentifier":"11","prism:pageRange":"1475-1491","prism:coverDate":"1994-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 1994","prism:doi":"10.1016/0031-3203(94)90126-0","pii":"0031-3203(94)90126-0","dc:description":"An image line is a very reliable feature in the feature-based structure-from-motion (SFM) problem. It has at least three advantages: (1) it is not easily affected by occlusion. (2) It can achieve subpixel accuracy. (3) The correspondence problem is easier and less ambiguous. Although some generalized SFM algorithms using image line features have been recently developed, they usually suffer from high error sensitivity and large matrix size. Besides, in order to make their estimations more robust, many line correspondences (much more than the least requirement in theory) are usually needed. These shortages are not beneficial for practical use. Because many sets of parallel lines are frequently encountered in an artificial 3D environment and can be easily identified, we try to utilize these identified parallel lines to simplify the generalized SFM problem and improve the performance of parameter estimation. A fast and reliable algorithm is proposed in our paper. Both computer-generated and real-world images are tested and several satisfactory results have been obtained. In addition, its error sensitivity and data degeneracy will be discussed. © 1994.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005429","afid":"60005429","affilname":"National Taiwan University","affiliation-city":"Taipei","affiliation-country":"Taiwan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202463605","authid":"7202463605","authname":"Pei S.","surname":"Pei","given-name":"Soo Chang","initials":"S.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005429"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006243859","authid":"7006243859","authname":"Liou L.","surname":"Liou","given-name":"Lin Gwo","initials":"L.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005429"}]}],"authkeywords":"Parallel lines | Perspective projection | Quaternion","source-id":"24823","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0028429275"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0028429275?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0028429275&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0028429275&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0028429275","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0028429275","eid":"2-s2.0-0028429275","dc:title":"Analysis of 3-D Rotation Fitting","dc:creator":"Kanatani K.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","prism:issn":"01628828","prism:volume":"16","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"543-549","prism:coverDate":"1994-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May 1994","prism:doi":"10.1109/34.291441","dc:description":"Computational techniques for fitting a 3-D rotation to 3-D data are recapitulated in a refined form as minimization over proper rotations, extending three existing methods-the method of singular value decomposition, the method of polar decomposition, and the method of quaternion representation.

A considerable amount of attention has been devoted to understanding the velocity-position transformation that takes place in the control of eye movements in three dimensions. Much of the work has focused on the idea that rotations in three dimensions do not commute and that a 'multiplicative quaternion model' of velocity-position integration is necessary to explain eye movements in three dimensions. Our study has indicated that this approach is not consistent with the physiology of the types of signals necessary to rotate the eyes. 2. We developed a three-dimensional dynamical system model for movement of the eye within its surrounding orbital tissue. The main point of the model is that the eye muscles generate torque to rotate the eye. When the eye reaches an orientation such that the restoring torque of the orbital tissue counterbalances the torque applied by the muscles, a unique equilibrium point is reached. The trajectory of the eye to reach equilibrium may follow any path, depending on the starting eye orientation and eye velocity. However, according to Euler's theorem, the equilibrium reached is equivalent to a rotation about a fixed axis through some angle from a primary orientation. This represents the shortest path that the eye could take from the primary orientation in reaching equilibrium. Consequently, it is also the shortest path for returning the eye to the primary orientation. Thus the restoring torque developed by the tissue surrounding the eye was approximated as proportional to the product of this angle and a unit vector along this axis. The relationship between orientation and restoring torque gives a unique torque-orientation relationship. 3. Once the appropriate torque- orientation relationship for eye rotation is established the velocity- position integrator can be modeled as a dynamical system that is a direct extension of the one-dimensional velocity-position integrator. The linear combination of the integrator state and a direct pathway signal is converted to a torque signal that activates the muscles to rotate the eyes. Therefore the output of the integrator is related to a torque signal that positions the eyes. It is not an eye orientation signal. The applied torque signal drives the eye to an equilibrium orientation such that the restoring torque equals the applied torque but in the opposite direction. The eye orientation reached at equilibrium is determined by the unique torque-orientation relation. Because torque signals are vectors, they commute. Thus our model indicates that the signals in the CNS can be treated as vectors and that the nonvector orientation properties of the eye globe are inherent in the dynamical system associated with the globe and its underlying tissue. 4. Listing's law is explained very simply by our model as being a property of the vector nature of the signals in the CNS driving the eyes, and its implementation is not localized to any specific locality within the CNS. If the neural vector signal driving the eye is confined to Listing's plane, i.e., the pitch-yaw plane in our model, then eye orientation will obey Listing's law. 5. We performed simulations to show that Listing's law is obeyed by our model for both saccades and smooth pursuit eye movements in the steady state. The simulations also showed that there is commutativity in terms of steady-state eye orientation. We performed simulations that compared the model output with data of others. Deviations from Listing's law were consistent with the physiological findings.","citedby-count":"97","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023814","afid":"60023814","affilname":"Brooklyn College","affiliation-city":"New York","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"pubmed-id":"8176431","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6507563736","authid":"6507563736","authname":"Schnabolk C.","surname":"Schnabolk","given-name":"C.","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023814"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005885674","authid":"7005885674","authname":"Raphan T.","surname":"Raphan","given-name":"T.","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023814"}]}],"source-id":"23475","fund-acr":"NEI","fund-no":"R01EY004148","fund-sponsor":"National Eye Institute","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0028090846"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0028090846?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0028090846&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0028090846&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0028090846","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0028090846","eid":"2-s2.0-0028090846","dc:title":"Strategy for fine motion manipulation of robots using kinematic constraints","dc:creator":"Dooley J.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","prism:issn":"10504729","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"0818653329"}],"prism:issueIdentifier":"pt 1","prism:pageRange":"656-661","prism:coverDate":"1994-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1994","dc:description":"This paper examines the problem of controlling a manipulator near a surface. It is assumed that the manipulator must move near or along the surface without contacting the surface. The problem, therefore, incorporates fine motion control and obstacle avoidance. It can occur in applications, such as telerobotic manipulation in space and optical inspection of surfaces. The strategy uses the kinematic constraints that arise from formulating the kinematics and dynamics in the image space of dual quaternion coordinates. Through Lagrange multipliers the constraints are incorporated directly into the dynamics and used to force the manipulator end effector to follow a path along the desired surface. The constraints appear algebraically, and can, therefore, be manipulated directly when developing and implementing strategies for avoiding collisions with the surface. The dynamics are formulated in the operational image space of the manipulator. Thus, the results are easily extended to multiple robot configurations.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010261","afid":"60010261","affilname":"Washington University in St. Louis","affiliation-city":"St. Louis","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56248589500","authid":"56248589500","authname":"Dooley J.","surname":"Dooley","given-name":"J.

Neuronal responses to electrical stimulation of the area of stomach and small intestine (single pulses of 100-500 μA, 0.5ms duration) were investigated. It was found that intraperitoneal stimulation delivered during slow wave sleep evoked clear excitatory responses in most simple and complex cells.

After all visible regions appeared over the whole sequence are segmented and tracked, a normal measurement matrix of surface normals and a distance measurement matrix of normal distances to the origins are constructed respectively. These two measurement matrices, with possibly many missing elements due to occlusion and mismatching, enable to formulate multiple view merging as a combination of two WLS problems. The solution to the first WLS problem, which employs the quaternion representation of the rotation matrix, yields surface normals and rotation matrices. Subsequently the normal distances and translation vectors are computed by solving the second WLS problem. Experiments using synthetic data and real range images show that our approach is robust against noise and mismatch because it produces a statistically optimal object model by making use of redundancy from multiple views. A toy house model from a sequence of real range images is presented.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027950","afid":"60027950","affilname":"Carnegie Mellon University","affiliation-city":"Pittsburgh","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55945523600","authid":"55945523600","authname":"Shum H.","surname":"Shum","given-name":"Heung Yeung","initials":"H.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027950"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35208602900","authid":"35208602900","authname":"Ikeuchi K.","surname":"Ikeuchi","given-name":"Katsushi","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027950"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202835239","authid":"7202835239","authname":"Reddy R.","surname":"Reddy","given-name":"Raj","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027950"}]}],"source-id":"24212","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
