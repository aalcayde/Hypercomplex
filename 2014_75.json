To obtain the reduced-references, we will model the QWT coefficients using probability density functions (pdf) whose parameters are used as reduced-references. IC are proposed in order to build the optimal histograms of the QWT coefficients to get most likely pdf of these. In the mixture model, IC are also used to obtain the number of distribution. From these models, we propose a measure of degradation by comparing probability density functions of the reference image and the distributions of the degraded image of the QWT subbands. We shall demonstrate that one phase of the QWT provides relevant information in the Image Quality Assessment. Tests confirmed the potentiality of this information and showed that the QWT produces a better coefficient of correlation with the Human Visual System than the Discrete Wavelet Transform.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032653","afid":"60032653","affilname":"Universite de Poitiers","affiliation-city":"Poitiers","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190341457","authid":"57190341457","authname":"Traoré A.","surname":"Traoré","given-name":"Albekaye","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032653"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36008284700","authid":"36008284700","authname":"Carré P.","surname":"Carré","given-name":"Philippe","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032653"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102402126","authid":"7102402126","authname":"Olivier C.","surname":"Olivier","given-name":"Christian","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032653"}]}],"authkeywords":"Information Criteria | model selection | Quaternionic Wavelet Transform | Reduced-Reference Image Quality Assessment","article-number":"7025105","source-id":"21100395901","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84983156578"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84983156578?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84983156578&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84983156578&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84983156578","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84983156578","eid":"2-s2.0-84983156578","dc:title":"Proceeding - ICARES 2014: 2014 IEEE International Conference on Aerospace Electronics and Remote Sensing Technology","prism:publicationName":"Proceeding - ICARES 2014: 2014 IEEE International Conference on Aerospace Electronics and Remote Sensing Technology","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781479961887"}],"prism:pageRange":"248p","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-27","prism:coverDisplayDate":"27 January 2014","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 37 papers.

The quaternion transmissibility was calculated based on the time-domain sequences of spatial vibration signals by using technique of quaternion Fourier transforms (DQFT). The quaternion transmissibility is superior to the common one because it can be used to deal with the spatial vibrations that are composed from three directional synchronous vibrations. And compared with the common transmissibility, the modular vector of the quaternion transmissibility is consistent with its theoretical value in spite of the installation orientation of the sensors, which is important in engineering applications of the transmissibility such as the structural damage identification. An actual damage identification experiment was carried out to verify the availability of the quaternion transmissibility, where technique of the Karhunen-Loeve Transform (K-LT) was employed. The identification results based on both common and quaternion transmissibility were obtained and compared with each other.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004538","afid":"60004538","affilname":"Dalian University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8213070800","authid":"8213070800","authname":"Ren T.","surname":"Ren","given-name":"Tongqun","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56493617500","authid":"56493617500","authname":"He L.","surname":"He","given-name":"Liang","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56494396700","authid":"56494396700","authname":"Hui M.","surname":"Hui","given-name":"Meiling","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56493418200","authid":"56493418200","authname":"Zhang Z.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Zhiyong","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]}],"authkeywords":"damage identification | quaternion transmissibility | spatial vibration | transmissibility","article-number":"7003955","source-id":"21100368998","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027927426"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027927426?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85027927426&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85027927426&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0030402613014319"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027927426","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85027927426","eid":"2-s2.0-85027927426","dc:title":"Quaternion-based improved LPP method for color face recognition","dc:creator":"Wu S.","prism:publicationName":"Optik","prism:issn":"00304026","prism:volume":"125","prism:issueIdentifier":"10","prism:pageRange":"2344-2349","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May 2014","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.ijleo.2013.10.071","pii":"S0030402613014319","dc:description":"In recent years, pattern recognition and computer vision have increasingly become the focus of research. Locality preserving projection (LPP) is a very important learning method in these two fields and has been widely used. Using LPP to perform face recognition, we usually can get a high accuracy. However, the face recognition application of LPP suffers from a number of problems and the small sample size is the most famous one. Moreover, though the face image is usually a color image, LPP cannot sufficiently exploit the color and we should first convert the color image into the gray image and then apply LPP to it. Transforming the color image into the gray image will cause a serious loss of image information. In this paper, we first use the quaternion to represent the color pixel. As a result, an original training or test sample can be denoted as a quaternion vector. Then we apply LPP to the quaternion vectors to perform feature extraction for the original training and test samples. The devised quaternion-based improved LPP method is presented in detail. Experimental results show that our method can get a higher classification accuracy than other methods. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

The objective is to increase the estimation precision of translational and rotational motion based on dual quaternion models and cooperation between connected sensors. The distributed Newton optimization method is applied to decompose the filtering task into a series of suboptimal problems and then solve them individually to achieve the global optimality. Our approach assumes that each sensor can communicate with its neighboring sensors to update the individual estimates. Simulation examples are demonstrated to compare the proposed algorithm with other methods in terms of estimation accuracy and converging rate.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004354","afid":"60004354","affilname":"Iowa State University","affiliation-city":"Ames","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55253750400","authid":"55253750400","authname":"Zu Y.","surname":"Zu","given-name":"Yue","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004354"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56692005500","authid":"56692005500","authname":"Sun C.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Chuangchuang","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004354"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/37861092800","authid":"37861092800","authname":"Dai R.","surname":"Dai","given-name":"Ran","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004354"}]}],"authkeywords":"Distributed Estimation | Dual Quaternion | Spatial Rigid Motion","article-number":"7039403","source-id":"87424","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988291983"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988291983?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84988291983&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84988291983&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988291983","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84988291983","eid":"2-s2.0-84988291983","dc:title":"2D color shapes description by quaternion Disc-Harmonic moments","dc:creator":"Dad N.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications, AICCSA","prism:issn":"21615322","prism:eIssn":"21615330","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781479971008"}],"prism:volume":"2014","prism:pageRange":"266-272","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2014","prism:doi":"10.1109/AICCSA.2014.7073208","dc:description":"Robustness to photometric transformations and invariance under geometric transformations are two crucial criteria that a shape descriptor must satisfy. In this direction, orthogonal moments have proved their performance since the image can be reconstructed from its descriptor. However, these conventional moments deal only with binary and gray-level images. Recently, the algebra of quaternions have been widely used in combination with these moments in order to describe color images. In this paper, we introduce the quaternion Disc- Harmonic moments (QDHMs) as an extension of the conventional Disc-Harmonic moments (DHMs) for describing 2D color shapes. The conventional DHMs were inspired by the spherical harmonics which use orthogonal basis functions and are known for their rotation-invariance property. Experiments on images extracted from the COIL-100 database were conducted in order to evaluate the performance of our descriptor. First, we have fixed some parameters that are the maximal order, the measure of similarity and the color space. Second, tests on photometric transformations robustness are provided. Finally, the discriminative power of the QDHMs based on recall-precision criterion is compared to the conventional disc-harmonic moments and the existing orthogonal quaternion-based moments.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60161501","afid":"60161501","affilname":"Ecole Supérieure de Technologie de Salé","affiliation-city":"Sale","affiliation-country":"Morocco"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019337","afid":"60019337","affilname":"Mohammed V University in Rabat","affiliation-city":"Rabat","affiliation-country":"Morocco"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012964","afid":"60012964","affilname":"Faculté des Sciences Dhar El Mahraz, Université Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah","affiliation-city":"Fez","affiliation-country":"Morocco"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56819059100","authid":"56819059100","authname":"Dad N.","surname":"Dad","given-name":"Nisrine","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012964"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221862377","authid":"57221862377","authname":"Ennahnahi N.","surname":"Ennahnahi","given-name":"Noureddine","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012964"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25422629800","authid":"25422629800","authname":"Ouatik S.E.A.","surname":"Ouatik","given-name":"Said El Alaoui","initials":"S.E.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012964"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24448607100","authid":"24448607100","authname":"Oumsis M.","surname":"Oumsis","given-name":"Mohamed","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019337"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60161501"}]}],"authkeywords":"CBIR | colored shape | Disc Hamonic moments | Quaternion | Shape description | Zernike moments","article-number":"7073208","source-id":"21100198533","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988281676"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988281676?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84988281676&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84988281676&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988281676","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84988281676","eid":"2-s2.0-84988281676","dc:title":"Applications of the Chinese Remainder Theorem in Signal Processing","dc:creator":"Liu Y.","prism:publicationName":"International Conference on Signal Processing Proceedings, ICSP","prism:volume":"2015-January","prism:issueIdentifier":"October","prism:pageRange":"625-630","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2014","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2014.7015079","dc:description":"Based on the very old methods of solving of simultaneous linear congruences, the Chinese Remainder Theorem is still a irreplaceable tool for the Computing, the Signal Processing and the Information Security.

The design of this reference solution and the remaining challenges are at the heart of this paper. A new filter with a quaternion based state vector exploits signals (acceleration and magnetic field) and motions of opportunity for estimating the navigation solution. Quasi Static Field (QSF) updates, Magnetic Angular Rate Updates (MARU) and Angular Gradient Update (AGU) are frequently applied for mitigating the low-cost inertial sensors errors. Experimental tests performed using a post-processed GPS differential solution as reference show an average accuracy of 1.2 m over 500 m walking path: 0.5 %. Discussions about the data acquisition protocol for meeting a 1 meter horizontal accuracy within two standard deviations of the mean (95.45%) is conducted.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60138422","afid":"60138422","affilname":"Université Gustave Eiffel","affiliation-city":"Marne-la-Vallee","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25634925800","authid":"25634925800","authname":"Renaudin V.","surname":"Renaudin","given-name":"Valerie","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60138422"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56298346100","authid":"56298346100","authname":"Combettes C.","surname":"Combettes","given-name":"Christophe","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60138422"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191246521","authid":"57191246521","authname":"Marchand C.","surname":"Marchand","given-name":"Camille","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60138422"}]}],"authkeywords":"free inertial | magnetometer | Pedestrian navigation | quaternion | reference system","article-number":"7275481","source-id":"21100780008","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988240408"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988240408?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84988240408&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84988240408&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988240408","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84988240408","eid":"2-s2.0-84988240408","dc:title":"Application of rotation vector algorithm for SINS attitude updating","dc:creator":"Wang Z.","prism:publicationName":"International Conference on Signal Processing Proceedings, ICSP","prism:volume":"2015-January","prism:issueIdentifier":"October","prism:pageRange":"2390-2393","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2014","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2014.7015422","dc:description":"The primary task of strap down inertial navigation system (SINS) algorithms is updating attitude timely and precisely. This paper presents an ARM based quad copter, using low-cost MEMS inertial sensors. In this paper we propose to use three methods, namely linear interpolation, gradient descent and complementary filter for attitude-updating. Meanwhile, an idea that the quaternion attitude could be updated by constructing micro-rotation quaternion from rotation vector in the sampling interval is proposed. The idea is based on geometric interpretation of space rotation transformation, while the general method is the differential equations of quaternion about rotation vector. Therefore the new method is an approximation method within enough short update intervals. Experiments on different methods show the effectiveness and accuracy of three improved algorithms with the rotation vector algorithm.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022381","afid":"60022381","affilname":"Beijing Jiaotong University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56735596700","authid":"56735596700","authname":"Wang Z.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Zhiqun","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022381"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401674380","authid":"7401674380","authname":"Yin X.","surname":"Yin","given-name":"Xunhe","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022381"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56734758500","authid":"56734758500","authname":"Li P.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Peidan","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022381"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56335999800","authid":"56335999800","authname":"Wan L.","surname":"Wan","given-name":"Liangjin","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022381"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude updating | MEMS inertial sensors | Quaternion | Rotation vector","article-number":"7015422","source-id":"21100780000","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988227343"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988227343?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84988227343&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84988227343&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988227343","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84988227343","eid":"2-s2.0-84988227343","dc:title":"Moving object detection based on HFT and dynamic fusion","dc:creator":"Li H.","prism:publicationName":"International Conference on Signal Processing Proceedings, ICSP","prism:volume":"2015-January","prism:issueIdentifier":"October","prism:pageRange":"895-899","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2014","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2014.7015133","dc:description":"To solve the problem of detecting salient moving object in the video shot by static camera, a new spatio-temporal object detection algorithm is proposed in this paper.

The advantage of such models consists in the fact that they have more parameters to characterize a signal. In this paper we study two generalizations in ℝ4.

The Riesz transform is a generalization of the Hilbert transform and builds up the monogenic signal of a scalar-valued function f. This type of fractional Riesz transform is based on rotations in ℝ4 and not on a fractional Fourier transform. Rotations in ℝ4 can by described by quaternions and therefore the algebraic structure we will use are quaternions.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008988","afid":"60008988","affilname":"Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg","affiliation-city":"Freiberg","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203087506","authid":"57203087506","authname":"Bernstein S.","surname":"Bernstein","given-name":"Swanhild","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008988"}]}],"authkeywords":"Fractional Hilbert transform | Fractional Riesz transform | Hilbert transform | Monogenic signals | Quaternions | Riesz transform","source-id":"21100447813","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84951743209"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84951743209?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84951743209&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84951743209&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84951743209","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84951743209","eid":"2-s2.0-84951743209","dc:title":"Distributed motion estimation of space objects using dual quaternions","dc:creator":"Zu Y.","prism:publicationName":"AIAA/AAS Astrodynamics Specialist Conference 2014","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781624103087"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2014","prism:doi":"10.2514/6.2014-4296","dc:description":"This paper examines the motion estimation problem for space objects using multiple image sensors in a connected network.

Modern industrial requirements of structural condition assessment demand the evaluation of defects using non-destructive and non-contact methods, which allow for detection, precise localization and identification of defect. From a great variety of non-destructive methods the vibration-based ones seem to be effective, simple and low-cost. In order to improve the effectiveness of defects assessment the wavelet-based signal processing technique could be applied. In this paper the modal analysis of a composite circular plate with an inclusion was carried out in order to acquire the modal shapes of vibration. The acquired modal shapes were processed using quaternion wavelet transform. The application of this transform leads to the better directional selectivity than classical discrete wavelet transform. Obtained results allow for detection and identification of location and dimensions of inclusion. The sensitivity analysis of considering particular modal shapes was carried out and described. Due to the effectiveness of the proposed approach it can be applied in laboratory testing as well as industrial quality control and non-destructive testing.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009081","afid":"60009081","affilname":"Silesian University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Gliwice","affiliation-country":"Poland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/38661200300","authid":"38661200300","authname":"Katunin A.","surname":"Katunin","given-name":"Andrzej","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009081"}]}],"authkeywords":"Circular composite plate | Modal analysis | Non-destructive testing | Quaternion wavelet transform","source-id":"12200154705","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84943554226"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84943554226?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84943554226&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84943554226&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84943554226","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84943554226","eid":"2-s2.0-84943554226","dc:title":"Identification and characterization of subgrain features in 3D EBSD data","dc:creator":"Loeb A.","prism:publicationName":"3DMS 2014 - Proceedings of the 2nd International Congress on 3D Materials Science","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781118945452"}],"prism:pageRange":"9-14","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2014","prism:doi":"10.1002/9781118990278.ch2","dc:description":"Plastic deformation generates cellular/subgrain structures in many types of metals, and these features have a pronounced influence on mechanical behavior as well as subsequent recovery and recrystallization processes. These features can be observed by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) but are challenging to identify automatically. For example, no threshold misorientation angle may adequately capture gradual orientation transitions without noise dominating the result. A more robust technique, fast multiscale clustering (FMC), partitions a data set with attention given to local and global patterns. With FMC, individual data points are combined iteratively into clusters. To determine similarity of clusters during the aggregation process, the method requires an appropriate distance metric. We have adapted FMC to EBSD data, quantifying distance with misorientation and using a novel variance function to accommodate quaternion data. This adaptation is capable of segmenting based on subtle and gradual variation as well as on sharp boundaries within the data, while maintaining linear run time. The method is useful for analysis of any EBSD data set for which the structure of grains or subgrain features is required, and it has been incorporated into the open-source quantitative texture analysis package MTEX. The sensitivity of a segmentation is controlled by a single parameter, analogous to the thresholding angle. To balance the desired identification of subtle boundaries with erroneous oversegmentation, a method to quantitatively optimize this free parameter has been developed. Since the FMC process does not depend on the spatial distribution of points, data can be in either 2D or 3D and organized with any geometry. In fact, the data points may have arbitrary placement, as is the case after correcting for instrument drift. Often investigation of the relationship between structure and formation mechanisms requires extraction of coherent surfaces from cluster volumes. FMC has been further modified to group closed 3D boundaries into distinct surfaces based on local normals of a triangulated surface. We demonstrate the capabilities of this technique with application to 3D EBSD data with subtle boundaries from a deformed Ni single crystal sample. In addition, a recrystallizing steel microstructure with three magnitudes of boundaries is analyzed to show how FMC can be used to characterize both sharp grain boundaries and more subtle features within the same data set.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60089000","afid":"60089000","affilname":"University of New South Wales, School of Materials Science and Engineering","affiliation-city":"Kensington","affiliation-country":"Australia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000812","afid":"60000812","affilname":"Harvey Mudd College","affiliation-city":"Claremont","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55762572300","authid":"55762572300","authname":"Loeb A.","surname":"Loeb","given-name":"Andrew","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000812"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/37016821000","authid":"37016821000","authname":"Soe B.","surname":"Soe","given-name":"Brian","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000812"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56678962800","authid":"56678962800","authname":"McMahon C.","surname":"McMahon","given-name":"Cullen","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000812"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005135028","authid":"7005135028","authname":"Ferry M.","surname":"Ferry","given-name":"Michael","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60089000"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603643806","authid":"6603643806","authname":"Bassman L.","surname":"Bassman","given-name":"Lori","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000812"}]}],"authkeywords":"3D EBSD | Electron backscatter diffraction | Fast multiscale clustering | Low angle boundaries | Microbands | Segmentation","source-id":"21100415086","fund-acr":"UNSW","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"University of New South Wales","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84940784297"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84940784297?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84940784297&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84940784297&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84940784297","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84940784297","eid":"2-s2.0-84940784297","dc:title":"A quaternion-valued reweighted minimisation approach to sparse vector sensor array design","dc:creator":"Hawes M.","prism:publicationName":"International Conference on Digital Signal Processing, DSP","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781479946129"}],"prism:volume":"2014-January","prism:pageRange":"426-430","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2014","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2014.6900699","dc:description":"In this work, the design of sparse vector sensor arrays is studied based on quaternionic formulations, which is a further extension of the recently proposed compressive sensing (CS) based design methods.
