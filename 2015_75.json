Based on the collinear equation, unit quaternion is employed to express rotation matrix, and the differential of collinear equation is realized by differential of rotation matrix. Advantages of this approach lie in that there's no discarding for higher order terms contrasting to traditional methods, and so there is no loss of accuracy. Main ideas and deduction of each equation are all given in detail. Three experiments are carried out to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the algorithm, and results show that no matter what initial estimates of similarity transformation parameters are used, the results are the same. However, if good initial estimates are given, the running time of the algorithm will be greatly decreased. Most important of all, using unit quaternion to express spatial rotation, only four parameters are needed, which is less than the nine of rotation matrix, and so programming of it will become easy.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073460","afid":"60073460","affilname":"China University of Mining and Technology","affiliation-city":"Xuzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/20436472100","authid":"20436472100","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yongbo","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073460"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15823109900","authid":"15823109900","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yunjia","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073460"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54406149900","authid":"54406149900","authname":"Yang H.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Huachao","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073460"}]}],"authkeywords":"Absolute orientation | Collinear equation | Pose estimation | Single image space resection | Unit quaternions","source-id":"18264","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84929011666"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84929011666?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84929011666&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84929011666&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0030402615001291"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84929011666","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84929011666","eid":"2-s2.0-84929011666","dc:title":"Frequency-spatial domain based salient region detection","dc:creator":"Sun X.","prism:publicationName":"Optik","prism:issn":"00304026","prism:volume":"126","prism:issueIdentifier":"9-10","prism:pageRange":"942-949","prism:coverDate":"2015-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 May 2015","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.ijleo.2015.03.004","pii":"S0030402615001291","dc:description":"A frequency-spatial domain based model for salient region detection was proposed.

However, the spectra of NUS data include sampling-induced artifacts and may be subject to distortions imposed by sparse data reconstruction techniques, issues not encountered with the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) applied to uniformly sampled data. The characterization of these NUS-induced artifacts allows for more informed sample schedule design and improved spectral quality. The DFT-Convolution Theorem, via the point-spread function (PSF) for a given sampling scheme, provides a useful framework for exploring the nature of NUS sampling artifacts. In this work, we analyze the PSFs for a set of specially constructed NUS schemes to quantify the interplay between randomization and dimensionality for reducing artifacts relative to uniformly undersampled controls. In particular, we find a synergistic relationship between the indirect time dimensions and the \"quadrature phase dimension\" (i.e. the hypercomplex components collected for quadrature detection). The quadrature phase dimension provides additional degrees of freedom that enable partial-component NUS (collecting a subset of quadrature components) to further reduce sampling-induced aliases relative to traditional full-component NUS (collecting all quadrature components). The efficacy of artifact reduction is exponentially related to the dimensionality of the sample space. Our results quantify the utility of partial-component NUS as an additional means for introducing decoherence into sampling schemes and reducing sampling artifacts in high dimensional experiments.","citedby-count":"18","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008789","afid":"60008789","affilname":"The Rowland Institute at Harvard","affiliation-city":"Cambridge","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000209","afid":"60000209","affilname":"UConn Health","affiliation-city":"Farmington","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"pubmed-id":"25899289","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602442910","authid":"6602442910","authname":"Schuyler A.D.","surname":"Schuyler","given-name":"Adam D.","initials":"A.D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000209"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006426691","authid":"7006426691","authname":"Maciejewski M.W.","surname":"Maciejewski","given-name":"Mark W.","initials":"M.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000209"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36885265400","authid":"36885265400","authname":"Stern A.S.","surname":"Stern","given-name":"Alan S.","initials":"A.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008789"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7103032021","authid":"7103032021","authname":"Hoch J.C.","surname":"Hoch","given-name":"Jeffrey C.","initials":"J.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000209"}]}],"authkeywords":"Aliasing | Compressed sensing | Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) | Partial-component NUS | Point-spread function (PSF)","source-id":"28525","fund-acr":"NIH","fund-no":"R21GM102366","fund-sponsor":"National Institutes of Health","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84929244650"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84929244650?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84929244650&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84929244650&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84929244650","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84929244650","eid":"2-s2.0-84929244650","dc:title":"Fast visual saliency detection with bisection search to scale selection","dc:creator":"Rajankar O.","prism:publicationName":"2015 International Conference on Pervasive Computing: Advance Communication Technology and Application for Society, ICPC 2015","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781479962723"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2015-04-15","prism:coverDisplayDate":"15 April 2015","prism:doi":"10.1109/PERVASIVE.2015.7087200","dc:description":"Inan image, objects are meaningful entity only at certain scales; however appropriate scales of object cannot be predicted a priori. The description of the image at multiple scales is thus necessary for salient objects detection. Multiple computations involved in this process make the model slow. To reduce the computational complexity bisection search to scale selection is proposed in this paper. The saliency detection with Hypercomplex Fourier Transform is made faster with the proposed algorithm. Minimum and maximum scales act as distinct seeds. To begin with, saliency maps and their entropy are obtained for these seeds. A set of lower half or upper half scales is selected recursively based on minimum entropy for further search. A saliency map of approximate minimum entropy is obtained efficiently.

In our contribution we further investigate these connections.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016348","afid":"60016348","affilname":"International Christian University","affiliation-city":"Mitaka","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8898269700","authid":"8898269700","authname":"Hitzer E.","surname":"Hitzer","given-name":"Eckhard","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016348"}]}],"article-number":"012042","source-id":"130053","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84928882781"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84928882781?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84928882781&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84928882781&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84928882781","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84928882781","eid":"2-s2.0-84928882781","dc:title":"A method of water vector edge updating based on improved GVF snakes model","dc:creator":"Yuan S.","prism:publicationName":"Wuhan Daxue Xuebao (Xinxi Kexue Ban)/Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University","prism:issn":"16718860","prism:volume":"40","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"503-509","prism:coverDate":"2015-04-05","prism:coverDisplayDate":"5 April 2015","prism:doi":"10.13203/j.whugis20140026","dc:description":"An automated updating of water vector edge based on improved GVF Snakes model from true color remote sensing image is presented in this paper.

This system aims to measure and display the contact distribution and relative pose between femoral head and acetabulum prosthesis during the surgery to help surgeons obtain accurate position of implants. The system consists of two parts: the Sensors Array Measuring System (SAMS) and the display part. The SAMS is composed of a sensors array (including contact sensors and an image sensor), signal conditioning circuits, a low power microcontroller (MCU), and a low-power transceiver. The SAMS is designed to estimate the relative pose of femoral head component to acetabular component. The display part processes the data from sensors and demonstrates the contact distribution and the pose of the prothesis during the surgery in 3-D graphics. The two parts of the system communicate with each other on an RF link at the band of 400 MHz. The signal conditioning circuits have been designed and fabricated in 0.18 μm CMOS process. Testing results show that the resolution of the signal conditioning circuits is 60.1 μ Vpp (1.35g) with ±100 mVpp input. The chip can operate under 1.2-to-3.6 V supply voltage for single battery applications with 116-160 μ A current consumption. The system has been verified by the simulation with rotation quaternion and translation vector. The experimental results show that the contact distribution and relative pose of the two components could be measured and demonstrated in real time. The relative error of rotation is less than 8% and the actual relative error of translation is less than 10%.","citedby-count":"27","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025278","afid":"60025278","affilname":"Tsinghua University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021170","afid":"60021170","affilname":"Institute of Semiconductors Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"25879970","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57050568400","authid":"57050568400","authname":"Chen H.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Hong","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025278"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56437028800","authid":"56437028800","authname":"Gao J.","surname":"Gao","given-name":"Jiyang","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025278"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56369467000","authid":"56369467000","authname":"Su S.","surname":"Su","given-name":"Shaojie","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025278"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192511714","authid":"57192511714","authname":"Zhang X.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xu","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021170"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55000510700","authid":"55000510700","authname":"Wang Z.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Zhihua","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025278"}]}],"authkeywords":"Pose estimation | reference pattern | signal conditioning circuits | total hip replacement (THR)","article-number":"7086359","source-id":"5700191219","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84925880437"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84925880437?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84925880437&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84925880437&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84925880437","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84925880437","eid":"2-s2.0-84925880437","dc:title":"Quaternion-Valued Echo State Networks","dc:creator":"Xia Y.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","prism:issn":"2162237X","prism:eIssn":"21622388","prism:volume":"26","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"663-673","prism:coverDate":"2015-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 April 2015","prism:doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2320715","dc:description":"Quaternion-valued echo state networks (QESNs) are introduced to cater for 3-D and 4-D processes, such as those observed in the context of renewable energy (3-D wind modeling) and human centered computing (3-D inertial body sensors). The introduction of QESNs is made possible by the recent emergence of quaternion nonlinear activation functions with local analytic properties, required by nonlinear gradient descent training algorithms. To make QENSs second-order optimal for the generality of quaternion signals (both circular and noncircular), we employ augmented quaternion statistics to introduce widely linear QESNs. To that end, the standard widely linear model is modified so as to suit the properties of dynamical reservoir, typically realized by recurrent neural networks. This allows for a full exploitation of second-order information in the data, contained both in the covariance and pseudocovariances, and a rigorous account of second-order noncircularity (improperness), and the corresponding power mismatch and coupling between the data components.

As a new tool for color image representation, its potential applications in several image-processing tasks are presented, including color image reconstruction, denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution. The proposed model represents the color image as a quaternion matrix, where a quaternion-based dictionary learning algorithm is presented using the K-quaternion singular value decomposition (QSVD) (generalized K-means clustering for QSVD) method. It conducts the sparse basis selection in quaternion space, which uniformly transforms the channel images to an orthogonal color space. In this new color space, it is significant that the inherent color structures can be completely preserved during vector reconstruction. Moreover, the proposed sparse model is more efficient comparing with the current sparse models for image restoration tasks due to lower redundancy between the atoms of different color channels. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed sparse image model avoids the hue bias issue successfully and shows its potential as a general and powerful tool in color image analysis and processing domain.","citedby-count":"117","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60121655","afid":"60121655","affilname":"Electrical and Computer Engineering Department","affiliation-city":"San Diego","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025111","afid":"60025111","affilname":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","affiliation-city":"Chapel Hill","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025084","afid":"60025084","affilname":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021032","afid":"60021032","affilname":"School of Electrical and Computer Engineering","affiliation-city":"Atlanta","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009226","afid":"60009226","affilname":"Colorado State University","affiliation-city":"Fort Collins","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55695017800","authid":"55695017800","authname":"Xu Y.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Yi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55609320200","authid":"55609320200","authname":"Yu L.","surname":"Yu","given-name":"Licheng","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025111"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54788433800","authid":"54788433800","authname":"Xu H.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Hongteng","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021032"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56915698200","authid":"56915698200","authname":"Zhang H.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Hao","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009226"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55843958400","authid":"55843958400","authname":"Nguyen T.","surname":"Nguyen","given-name":"Truong","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60121655"}]}],"authkeywords":"color image | dictionary learning | image restoration | K-QSVD | quaternion matrix analysis | Vector sparse representation","article-number":"7024169","source-id":"25534","fund-no":"61025005","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84923329719"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84923329719?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84923329719&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84923329719&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0096300315001071"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84923329719","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84923329719","eid":"2-s2.0-84923329719","dc:title":"Quaternion polar complex exponential transform for invariant color image description","dc:creator":"Wang X.","prism:publicationName":"Applied Mathematics and Computation","prism:issn":"00963003","prism:volume":"256","prism:pageRange":"951-967","prism:coverDate":"2015-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 April 2015","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.amc.2015.01.075","pii":"S0096300315001071","dc:description":"Moments and moment invariants have been widely used as a basic feature descriptors in image analysis, pattern recognition, and image retrieval. However, they are mainly used to deal with the binary or gray-scale images, which lose some significant color information. Recently, quaternion techniques were introduced to conventional image moments (including Fourier-Mellin moments, Zernike/Pseudo Zernike moments, and Bessel-Fourier moments, etc.) for describing color images, and some quaternion moment and moment invariants were developed. But, the conventional image moments usually cannot effectively capture the image information, especially the edges. Besides, the kernel computation of them involves computation of a number of factorial terms, which inevitably cause the numerical stability of these moments. Based on effective polar complex exponential transform (PCET) and algebra of quaternions, we introduced the quaternion polar complex exponential transform (QPCET) for describing color images in this paper, which can be seen as the generalization of PCET for gray-level images. It is shown that the QPCETs can be obtained from the PCET of each color channel. We derived and analyzed the rotation, scaling, and translation (RST) invariant property of QPCET. We also discussed the problem of color image retrieval using QPCET.

In the feature extraction stage, the adaptive quaternion pseudo-Zernike moments (AQPZMs) are used to describe the features of image blocks. The features of image blocks with larger entropy are described by quaternion pseudo-Zernike moments (QPZMs) with higher order. On the contrary, the QPZMs with lower order are used to describe the features of image blocks with smaller entropy. In the classification stage, the ensemble learning classifier is used for identification. The experimental results of different color face datasets show that compared with the recognition algorithms exploiting QPZMs or quaternion two-dimensional principal component analysis (Q2DPCA) to extract global features, the proposed algorithm can achieve higher accuracy when the face images are affected by the factors such as illumination, facial expression and so on.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005244","afid":"60005244","affilname":"Southeast University","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55849891700","authid":"55849891700","authname":"Shao Z.","surname":"Shao","given-name":"Zhuhong","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55446539500","authid":"55446539500","authname":"Ouyang J.","surname":"Ouyang","given-name":"Junlin","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/38561738500","authid":"38561738500","authname":"Liao F.","surname":"Liao","given-name":"Fan","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7203086899","authid":"7203086899","authname":"Shu H.","surname":"Shu","given-name":"Huazhong","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color face recognition | Ensemble learning | Local feature | Quaternion pseudo-Zernike moment","source-id":"21174","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84924912211"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84924912211?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84924912211&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84924912211&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84924912211","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84924912211","eid":"2-s2.0-84924912211","dc:title":"Quaternion-based attitude control design and hardware-in-the-loop simulation of suborbital modules with cold gas thrusters","dc:creator":"Mousavi S.F.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering","prism:issn":"09544100","prism:eIssn":"20413025","prism:volume":"229","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"717-735","prism:coverDate":"2015-03-16","prism:coverDisplayDate":"16 March 2015","prism:doi":"10.1177/0954410014539294","dc:description":"This paper discusses design and implementation of a quaternion-based attitude control system for the short-duration mission of suborbital modules using cold-gas thrusters.

With the quaternion approach, fewer images in the NEB are needed to represent MEPs accurately. In both NEB and DIMER calculations of finite systems, the number of iterations required to reach convergence is significantly reduced.

Meanwhile, the quaternion matrix is converted into the information of the phase and amplitude by the Euler form of the quaternion. Secondly, the phase and amplitude of the quaternion matrix are used as the smoothness constraints for the compressed sensing (CS) problem to make the reconstructing results more accurate.

Through contrastive experiments with the current methods including singular value decomposition, orthogonal decomposition and unit quaternion decomposition, the proposed algorithm with a more compact modus, performs better overall results of efficiency improvement, which maintains the accuracy and the stability at the same time.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021666","afid":"60021666","affilname":"Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56470108100","authid":"56470108100","authname":"Dai Y.","surname":"Dai","given-name":"Yuxi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57212419877","authid":"57212419877","authname":"Shen Q.","surname":"Shen","given-name":"Qiu","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12761995000","authid":"12761995000","authname":"Wang H.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Huinan","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16833420700","authid":"16833420700","authname":"Kong F.","surname":"Kong","given-name":"Fanqiang","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021666"}]}],"authkeywords":"3D motion estimation | Binocular vision | Dual quaternion","source-id":"29715","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84927636901"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84927636901?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84927636901&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84927636901&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S016783961500045X"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84927636901","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84927636901","eid":"2-s2.0-84927636901","dc:title":"Identification and \"reverse engineering\" of Pythagorean-hodograph curves","dc:creator":"Farouki R.T.","prism:publicationName":"Computer Aided Geometric Design","prism:issn":"01678396","prism:volume":"34","prism:pageRange":"21-36","prism:coverDate":"2015-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 March 2015","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.cagd.2015.04.001","pii":"S016783961500045X","dc:description":"Methods are developed to identify whether or not a given polynomial curve, specified by Bézier control points, is a Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curve - and, if so, to reconstruct the internal algebraic structure that allows one to exploit the advantageous properties of PH curves. Two approaches to identification of PH curves are proposed. The first is based on the satisfaction of a system of algebraic constraints by the control-polygon legs, and the second uses the fact that numerical quadrature rules that are exact for polynomials of a certain maximum degree generate arc length estimates for PH curves exhibiting a sharp saturation as the number of sample points is increased. These methods are equally applicable to planar and spatial PH curves, and are fully elaborated for cubic and quintic PH curves. The reverse engineering problem involves computing the complex or quaternion coefficients of the pre-image polynomials generating planar or spatial Pythagorean hodographs, respectively, from prescribed Bézier control points. In the planar case, a simple closed-form solution is possible, but for spatial PH curves the reverse engineering problem is much more involved.","citedby-count":"22","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021859","afid":"60021859","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Firenze","affiliation-city":"Florence","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014439","afid":"60014439","affilname":"University of California, Davis","affiliation-city":"Davis","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006823457","authid":"7006823457","authname":"Farouki R.T.","surname":"Farouki","given-name":"Rida T.","initials":"R.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014439"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23468999200","authid":"23468999200","authname":"Giannelli C.","surname":"Giannelli","given-name":"Carlotta","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021859"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603641743","authid":"6603641743","authname":"Sestini A.","surname":"Sestini","given-name":"Alessandra","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021859"}]}],"authkeywords":"Arc length | Bézier control points | Numerical quadrature | Parametric speed | Pythagorean-hodograph curves | Reverse engineering","source-id":"24998","fund-acr":"INdAM","fund-no":"RBFR13FBI3","fund-sponsor":"Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica \"Francesco Severi\"","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84926283643"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84926283643?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84926283643&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84926283643&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84926283643","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84926283643","eid":"2-s2.0-84926283643","dc:title":"Video flame detection based on fusion of multi-feature","dc:creator":"Yan Y.","prism:publicationName":"Jisuanji Fuzhu Sheji Yu Tuxingxue Xuebao/Journal of Computer-Aided Design and Computer Graphics","prism:issn":"10039775","prism:volume":"27","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"433-440","prism:coverDate":"2015-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 March 2015","dc:description":"The selective attention mechanism of human visual system can quickly locate salient targets in the image without training in complex scenes.

Most of the objective quality metrics in use are Full-Reference (FR), requiring the original video sequance for comparison. In the case of quality assessment for stereoscopic video, both left and right views need to be considered. In this paper, we introduce a novel Reduced-Reference (RR) quality metric for stereoscopic video using 3D structural tensors, based on the fact that the Human Visual System (HVS) is more sensitive to the structural information present in the scene. This method incorporates a new saliency detection method by considering spatial and temporal aspects of the video sequance.

They are detected by applying first and second derivatives to responses of complex cells in combination with two inhibition schemes to suppress responses along lines and edges. A number of optimisations make our new algorithm much faster than previous biologically inspired models, achieving real-time performance on modern GPUs and competitive speeds on CPUs. In this paper we show that the keypoints exhibit state-of-the-art repeatability in standardised benchmarks, often yielding best-in-class performance. This makes them interesting both in biological models and as a useful detector in practice.

For establishing line correspondences we perform exhaustive search on the space of camera pose values till we obtain a pose (position and rotation) which is geometrically consistent with the given set of 2D, 3D lines. For this highly complex search we design a strategy which performs precomputations on the 3D model using separate set of constraints on position and rotation values. During runtime, the set of different rotation values are ranked independently and combined with each position values in the order of their ranking. Then successive geometric constraints which are much simpler when compared to computing reprojection error are used to eliminate incorrect pose values. We show that the ranking of rotation values reduces the number of trials needed by a huge factor and the simple geometric constraints avoid the need for computing the reprojection error in most cases. Though the execution time for the current MATLAB implementation is far from realtime requirement, our method can be accelerated significantly by exploiting simplicity and parallelizability of the operations we employ. For eliminating the degenerate case in the state of art pose estimation method, we reformulate the rotation representation. We use unit quaternions instead of CGR parameters used by the method.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012954","afid":"60012954","affilname":"Oulun Yliopisto","affiliation-city":"Oulu","affiliation-country":"Finland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/48361661400","authid":"48361661400","authname":"Srikrishna Bhat K.K.","surname":"Srikrishna Bhat","given-name":"K.

We prove that if K/k is an extension of prime degree, or of degree n such that the normal closure of K over k has the Galois group isomorphic to An or Sn, then the interval (NK/k K*, k*) contains only the obvious two norm groups. Also, the interval (NK/k K*, k*) contains a finite number of norm groups for any Galois extension of degree 4, and there are extensions with Galois groups order 8 for which the corresponding intervals contain a finite number of norm groups. The main theorem in our earlier work states that the interval (NK/k K*, k*) contains infinitely many norm groups for any Galois extension of even degree that is not a 2-extension, the so-called 2&#x1D52B;-\\emphextensions. In the present work we generalize the main theorem to non-Galois 2&#x1D52B;-extensions K/k, and determine some subintervals of (NK/k K*, k*) that contain infinitely many norm groups. We then use this theorem to prove that the interval (NK/k K*, k*) contains infinitely many norm groups for any Galois 2-extension K/k with the Galois group that either contains an element of order 8 or contains the quaternion group Q8 of order 8, or Q8 is a homomorphic image of the Galois group.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004092","afid":"60004092","affilname":"Towson University","affiliation-city":"Towson","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201415031","authid":"7201415031","authname":"Stern L.","surname":"Stern","given-name":"Leonid","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004092"}]}],"authkeywords":"Class field theory | Finite Groups | Galois theory | Norm groups","source-id":"25800","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84928923135"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84928923135?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84928923135&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84928923135&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84928923135","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84928923135","eid":"2-s2.0-84928923135","dc:title":"A system to control power currents of ineffective instantaneous power compensation","dc:creator":"Nos O.V.","prism:publicationName":"Russian Electrical Engineering","prism:issn":"10683712","prism:volume":"86","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"72-78","prism:coverDate":"2015-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 February 2015","prism:doi":"10.3103/S1068371215020108","dc:description":"The goal of increasing the energy efficiency of three-phase ac systems is to reduce or completely exclude losses caused by inactive electric-energy fluxes. This can be achieved by practical use of active power filters that make it possible to eliminate distortions in the harmonic form of signals, to suppress high-frequency harmonics, to perform balancing of phase quantities, to reduce voltage jumps, to damp resonance effects, etc. The main propositions of a new approach to formation of compensatory effects at the output of the given type of semiconductor converters are set forth. The approach is based on dividing phase currents of arbitrary form into active and reactive components with the use of a hypercomplex space. The experimental study results show that the developed compensation algorithms ensure a unified or leading power factor with a harmonic form of consumed currents in the case of clearly pronounced unbalance and nonlinearity of load circuits, which allows practical implementation of highly efficient power-saving three-phase systems of electric-energy transmission, distribution, and conversion.","citedby-count":"18","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033394","afid":"60033394","affilname":"Novosibirsk State Technical University","affiliation-city":"Novosibirsk","affiliation-country":"Russian Federation"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25031690800","authid":"25031690800","authname":"Nos O.V.","surname":"Nos","given-name":"O.

However, the parameter extraction of target micro-motion is generally constrained by the factors of target translation compensation precision, radar equipment operating state and environment which lead to the decline of target recognition rate. At first, the quaternion based micro-motion models of warhead and decoy are established in this paper. Then the target micro-Doppler time-frequency image is regarded as a color image and described by quaternion matrix. According to the stability and rotation invariance properties of singular value vector, the micro-Doppler feature extraction and classification method of ballistic targets is presented based on QMSVD and SVM. Simulation results show that the QMSVD based feature vector is more effective than that of Hu moment based. To improve the SNR is benefit to improve the target recognition rate of classifier. With the increasing of the estimation error of target radial velocity, the target recognition rate of the classifier will decrease. Moreover, the target recognition rate will increase obviously along with the increasing of the radar PRF.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073458","afid":"60073458","affilname":"China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073446","afid":"60073446","affilname":"Beijing Institute of Radio Measurement","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/112634977","afid":"112634977","affilname":"Air Force Early Warning Academy","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55657616800","authid":"55657616800","authname":"Sun Y.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Yongjian","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073446"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"112634977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005762915","authid":"7005762915","authname":"Mu H.","surname":"Mu","given-name":"Heqiang","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073446"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/38061140400","authid":"38061140400","authname":"Cheng Z.","surname":"Cheng","given-name":"Zhen","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073458"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55639536200","authid":"55639536200","authname":"Fu Y.","surname":"Fu","given-name":"Ying","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"112634977"}]}],"authkeywords":"Feature extraction | Micro-Doppler | Quaternion matrix | Singular value decomposition | Target recognition","source-id":"96848","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
