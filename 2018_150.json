The method is based on dynamic time warping (DTW) motion capture (MoCap) signal matching in hierarchical kinematic model. We have used quaternion-based angles description. To evaluate our novel MoCap evaluation algorithm we have used recordings of black belt Shorin-Ryu karate master and black belt Oyama karate master. Both of them performed mawashi-geri kick with a right leg. The DTW normalized distance (one minus module of dot product of quaternions) for hips joints equals 0.003, for right thighs 0.018 and 0.059 for right legs. The proposed evaluation and visualization technique seems to be a valuable tool for advanced human motion analysis. The DTW signal mapping plots are even more informative when one can rotate them and change number of points to display to see the kinematic progress.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017351","afid":"60017351","affilname":"AGH University of Krakow","affiliation-city":"Krakow","affiliation-country":"Poland"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015509","afid":"60015509","affilname":"Uniwersytet Pedagogiczny im.

Since this descriptor is mainly composed by histograms, little work (if any) has been done for selecting its relevant features (either the bins or the blocks). In this paper, we address feature selection for both the classic ELBP representation and the recently proposed color quaternionic LBP (QLBP). We introduce a filter method for the automatic weighting of attributes or blocks using an improved version of the margin-based iterative search Simba algorithm. This new improved version introduces two main modifications: (i) the hypothesis margin of a given instance is computed by taking into account the K-nearest neighboring examples within the same class as well as the K-nearest neighboring examples with a different label; (ii) the distances between samples and their nearest neighbors are computed using the weighted χ2 distance instead of the Euclidean one. This algorithm has been compared favorably with several competing feature selection algorithms including the Euclidean-based Simba as well as variance and Fisher score algorithms giving higher performances. The proposed method is useful for other descriptors that are formed by histograms. Experimental results show that the QLBP descriptor allows an improvement of the accuracy in discriminating faces compared with the ELBP. They also show that the obtained selection (attributes or blocks) can either improve recognition performance or maintain it with a significant reduction in the descriptor size.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104285","afid":"60104285","affilname":"Ikerbasque, Basque Foundation for Science","affiliation-city":"Bilbao","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027856","afid":"60027856","affilname":"Universidad del Pais Vasco","affiliation-city":"Leioa","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001741","afid":"60001741","affilname":"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid","affiliation-city":"Getafe","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602925990","authid":"6602925990","orcid":"0000-0002-4971-3613","authname":"Moujahid A.","surname":"Moujahid","given-name":"Abdelmalik","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001741"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55967501800","authid":"55967501800","authname":"Dornaika F.","surname":"Dornaika","given-name":"Fadi","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027856"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104285"}]}],"authkeywords":"Face descriptors | Face recognition | Features selection","source-id":"21101017225","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062701552"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062701552?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85062701552&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85062701552&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062701552","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85062701552","eid":"2-s2.0-85062701552","dc:title":"An Efficient Method for Solving a Quaternionic Least-Squares Problem","dc:creator":"Shojaei-Fard A.","prism:publicationName":"International Journal of Applied and Computational Mathematics","prism:issn":"23495103","prism:eIssn":"21995796","prism:volume":"4","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2018-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 February 2018","prism:doi":"10.1007/s40819-017-0458-6","dc:description":"The quaternions play a crucial role in various research areas such as computer graphic, integrated navigation systems, color image processing, signal processing, quantum physics etc. Consider the quaternion least-squares problem min∥∑j=1q(AijXjBij+CijXjηHDij-Ei)∥,i=1,2,…,p,where Aij,Bij,Cij,Dij∈Qm×m, Q is the division algebra of quaternions, X= (X 1 , … , X q ) and X ηH = ηX H η where η= { i, j, k} are quaternion units.

However, the attitudes information output by CNS is observable for some state components in state vector. In common SINS/CNS integrated mode, the output information of CNS needs to be converted to navigation coordinate frame, which may decrease the accuracy of integrated navigation system. For the problems above, an improved SINS/GNSS/CNS federal filter based on dual quaternions is proposed. The dimension of local filter is decreased by the observability analysis of state vector, which assures the navigation accuracy and improves the real-time performance at the same time. The improved SINS/CNS integrated mode based on dual quaternions can utilize the attitudes information of CNS to integrate directly and avoid using those unobservable state components to correct SINS. Thus, the effective use of high precision CNS information is realized. The simulated results show that the proposed method has the same navigation accuracy as centralized Kalman filter, and can obtain better navigation performance when GNSS signal is lost.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021666","afid":"60021666","affilname":"Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57213233902","authid":"57213233902","authname":"Min Y.L.","surname":"Min","given-name":"Yan Ling","initials":"Y.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12762452800","authid":"12762452800","authname":"Xiong Z.","surname":"Xiong","given-name":"Zhi","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56307900300","authid":"56307900300","authname":"Xing L.","surname":"Xing","given-name":"Li","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55966725800","authid":"55966725800","authname":"Liu J.Y.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Jian Ye","initials":"J.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55695130000","authid":"55695130000","authname":"Yin D.Q.","surname":"Yin","given-name":"De Quan","initials":"D.Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021666"}]}],"authkeywords":"Celestial navigation system | Dual quaternions | Federal filter | Global navigation satellite system | Observability analysis | Strapdown inertial navigation system","source-id":"17155","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85042328122"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85042328122?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85042328122&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85042328122&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85042328122","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85042328122","eid":"2-s2.0-85042328122","dc:title":"Structural state inspection using dual-tree quaternion wavelet transform","dc:creator":"Ren T.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Vibroengineering","prism:issn":"13928716","prism:volume":"20","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"138-151","prism:coverDate":"2018-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 February 2018","prism:doi":"10.21595/jve.2017.18403","dc:description":"The dual-tree quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) was used in conjunction with quaternion-based three-channel joint transmissibility (QTJT) for state inspection. Multiple QTJTs from the same structural state were used to construct a state matrix, which was considered as a feature image. Then QWT coefficients of the feature image were calculated. It supported one magnitude and three phases, in particular, the low-frequency magnitude-phase was set as state feature index. Ultimately, the difference of the state feature indexes were utilized as the state indicator. This method reduced the influence on state inspection caused by measurement uncertainty of single testing sample, because it took overall consideration of multiple testing samples and described the similarity from multiple directions. The availability of suggested method was demonstrated by a real experiment, in which the state changing was realized by loosening fasteners and altering the longitudinal force of rail. This method was also compared with method based on Karhunen-Loeve Transform (K-LT) and artificial neural network (ANN). Experimental result indicated that the suggested method was integrated optimal, moreover, the resolution of the longitudinal force of rail was less than 10 MPa which was equivalent to temperature change of 1.75 °C for full-lock rail.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004538","afid":"60004538","affilname":"Dalian University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8213070800","authid":"8213070800","authname":"Ren T.","surname":"Ren","given-name":"Tongqun","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56494396700","authid":"56494396700","authname":"Hui M.","surname":"Hui","given-name":"Meiling","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56039570800","authid":"56039570800","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiaodong","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56493418200","authid":"56493418200","authname":"Zhang Z.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Zhiyong","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8544626500","authid":"8544626500","authname":"Liang J.","surname":"Liang","given-name":"Junsheng","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]}],"authkeywords":"Dual-tree quaternion wavelet transform | Longitudinal stress | Quaternion-based three-channel joint transmissibility | State inspection","source-id":"12200154705","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"51305064","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85021648740"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85021648740?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85021648740&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85021648740&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0736584516301284"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85021648740","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85021648740","eid":"2-s2.0-85021648740","dc:title":"Profile tracking with ultrasonic alignment for automatic Non-destructive testing of complex structures","dc:creator":"Zhen X.","prism:publicationName":"Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing","prism:issn":"07365845","prism:volume":"49","prism:pageRange":"134-142","prism:coverDate":"2018-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"February 2018","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.rcim.2017.06.007","pii":"S0736584516301284","dc:description":"Micro-defects located on complex geometrical structures are difficult to inspect using traditional non-destructive testing (NDT) equipment, especially for those aerospace components that have obvious variation of thickness. This is because the tracking of the profile of the test surface cannot usually satisfy the requirements of high-accuracy measurement so that the inspection results are inaccurate. In this paper, an industrial robot is used as an auxiliary test method to realize the inspection scanning motion. Matrix transformation of the robotic orientation is proposed to investigate the correct spatial relationship between the specimen and the ultrasonic probe, based on the mathematical models of coordinate conversion between the user frame and the robotic tool frame. The ultrasonic waves reflected by the test surface were used to find and represent the character of the defects in the specimen. Moreover, robotic orientation is calibrated by the ultrasonic alignment method based on the quaternion algorithm, so the robot can adjust the orientation of the tool frame to satisfy the ultrasonic incident angle constraints, and the precision of robotic trajectory is enhanced compared to that of other NDT methods. Our experimental results verified the accuracy of robotic scanning trajectory while the defect character can be captured from the ultrasonic echo waves. If the proposed approach is used, the trajectory error is no more than 0.275 mm with respect to the test specimen. Signals collected from echo waves can be transformed into ultrasonic images and the integrity of the specimen is evaluated based on those signals. In addition, the distribution of defects in the specimen was shown with a higher resolution of 0.15 mm derived from the distance between the adjacent points, if the robotic orientation is correct at each point in the scanning trajectory.","citedby-count":"18","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016835","afid":"60016835","affilname":"Beijing Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56714499800","authid":"56714499800","authname":"Zhen X.","surname":"Zhen","given-name":"Xiao","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194693071","authid":"57194693071","authname":"Yong Y.","surname":"Yong","given-name":"You","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194685821","authid":"57194685821","authname":"Chun Guang X.","surname":"Chun Guang","given-name":"Xu","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194689141","authid":"57194689141","authname":"Ding Guo X.","surname":"Ding Guo","given-name":"Xiao","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25928278000","authid":"25928278000","authname":"Fang Fang L.","surname":"Fang Fang","given-name":"Liu","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194682294","authid":"57194682294","authname":"Xin Liang L.","surname":"Xin Liang","given-name":"Li","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]}],"authkeywords":"Coordinate conversion | Matrix transform | Quaternion | Robotic scanning trajectory | Ultrasonic alignment","source-id":"18080","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"51335001","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85016624502"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85016624502?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85016624502&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85016624502&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85016624502","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85016624502","eid":"2-s2.0-85016624502","dc:title":"Four-image encryption scheme based on quaternion Fresnel transform, chaos and computer generated hologram","dc:creator":"Yu C.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","prism:issn":"13807501","prism:eIssn":"15737721","prism:volume":"77","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"4585-4608","prism:coverDate":"2018-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 February 2018","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11042-017-4637-6","dc:description":"A novel four-image encryption scheme based on the quaternion Fresnel transforms (QFST), computer generated hologram and the two-dimensional (2D) Logistic-adjusted-Sine map (LASM) is presented.

With QHT, the host color image is processed in a holistic manner. By use of Schur decomposition, the watermark is embedded into the host color image by modifying the Q matrix. To make the watermarking scheme resistant to geometric attacks, a geometric distortion detection method based upon quaternion Zernike moment is introduced. Thus, all the watermark embedding, the watermark extraction and the geometric distortion parameter estimation employ the color image holistically in the proposed watermarking scheme. By using the detection method, the watermark can be extracted from the geometric distorted color images.

The problem is challenging due to the variety of objects as well as the complexity of a scene caused by clutter and occlusions between objects. In this work, we introduce PoseCNN, a new Convolutional Neural Network for 6D object pose estimation. PoseCNN estimates the 3D translation of an object by localizing its center in the image and predicting its distance from the camera. The 3D rotation of the object is estimated by regressing to a quaternion representation. We also introduce a novel loss function that enables PoseCNN to handle symmetric objects. In addition, we contribute a large scale video dataset for 6D object pose estimation named the YCB-Video dataset. Our dataset provides accurate 6D poses of 21 objects from the YCB dataset observed in 92 videos with 133,827 frames. We conduct extensive experiments on our YCB-Video dataset and the OccludedLINEMOD dataset to show that PoseCNN is highly robust to occlusions, can handle symmetric objects, and provide accurate pose estimation using only color images as input. When using depth data to further refine the poses, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging OccludedLINEMOD dataset.

Secondly, we use quaternions to represent 3D geometric skeletal relationship of the obtained skeletal sequences to generate quaternion feature descriptors. Finally, we use the support vector machine classifier to train and test the quaternion feature descriptors to realize recognition.

To deal with the nonlinear and nonstationary characteristics of real-world multidimensional data, quaternion-valued nonlinear learning systems, like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are highly desirable. To avoid current problems associated with the design of quaternion-valued RNNs, such as the computationally demanding training tasks and the stringent standard analyticity conditions in developing full quaternion-valued nonlinearities, quaternion-valued echo state networks (QESNs), built upon quaternion nonlinear activation functions with local analytic properties, are introduced. To further make QESNs second-order optimal for the generality of quaternion signals (both circular and noncircular), the standard widely linear model is modified so as to suit the properties of dynamical reservoir, typically realized by RNNs. This allows for a full exploitation of second-order information in the multidimensional data, contained both in the covariance and pseudocovariances. Simulations in the prediction setting on both benchmark 3D and 4D circular and noncircular signals and on noncircular, nonlinear and nonstationary real-world 3D body motion tracking and wind forecasting support the analysis.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015150","afid":"60015150","affilname":"Imperial College London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005244","afid":"60005244","affilname":"Southeast University","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book","subtype":"ch","subtypeDescription":"Book Chapter","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25958477900","authid":"25958477900","authname":"Xia Y.","surname":"Xia","given-name":"Yili","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189332044","authid":"57189332044","authname":"Xiang M.","surname":"Xiang","given-name":"Min","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193008058","authid":"57193008058","authname":"Li Z.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Zhe","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006513328","authid":"7006513328","authname":"Mandic D.P.","surname":"Mandic","given-name":"Danilo P.","initials":"D.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]}],"authkeywords":"Augmented quaternion statistics | Local analyticity | Quaternion echo state networks (QESNs) | Quaternion widely linear model | Second-order noncircularity","source-id":"21100967666","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062383063"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062383063?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85062383063&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85062383063&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062383063","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85062383063","eid":"2-s2.0-85062383063","dc:title":"Storage capacities of twin-multistate quaternion hopfield neural networks","dc:creator":"Kobayashi M.","prism:publicationName":"Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience","prism:issn":"16875265","prism:eIssn":"16875273","prism:volume":"2018","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2018-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2018","prism:doi":"10.1155/2018/1275290","dc:description":"A twin-multistate quaternion Hopfield neural network (TMQHNN) is a multistate Hopfield model and can store multilevel information, such as image data.

The proposed method utilizes the attitude estimation to produce velocity and position estimation. A particle filter (PF) is employed to estimate the attitude quaternion from gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer sensors. The improvement is based on the resampling method making the original filter much faster to converge. After smoothing, the trajectory is then converted to low-definition images which are further sent to a backpropagation neural network (BP-NN) based recognizer for matching. Experiments on real-world hardware are carried out to show the effectiveness and uniqueness of the proposed method.

While these L ∞ algebras always exist, they generally do not realize a nontrivial symmetry in a field theory. In order to define L ∞ algebras with genuine field theory realizations, we prove the significantly more general theorem that if the Jacobiator takes values in the image of any linear map that defines an ideal there is a 3-term L ∞ algebra with a generally nontrivial 4-bracket. We discuss special cases such as the commutator algebra of octonions, its contraction to the “R-flux algebra,” and the Courant algebroid.","citedby-count":"13","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028717","afid":"60028717","affilname":"Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München","affiliation-city":"Munich","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026415","afid":"60026415","affilname":"Stony Brook University","affiliation-city":"Stony Brook","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008743","afid":"60008743","affilname":"Max Planck Institute for Physics (Werner Heisenberg Institute)","affiliation-city":"Munich","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001430","afid":"60001430","affilname":"Universidade Federal do ABC","affiliation-city":"Santo Andre","affiliation-country":"Brazil"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8433494300","authid":"8433494300","authname":"Hohm O.","surname":"Hohm","given-name":"Olaf","initials":"O.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026415"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8556367200","authid":"8556367200","authname":"Kupriyanov V.","surname":"Kupriyanov","given-name":"Vladislav","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008743"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001430"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004238814","authid":"7004238814","authname":"Lüst D.","surname":"Lüst","given-name":"Dieter","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008743"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028717"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194948539","authid":"57194948539","authname":"Traube M.","surname":"Traube","given-name":"Matthias","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008743"}]}],"article-number":"9282905","source-id":"19900192029","fund-acr":"ERC","fund-no":"0079/16-2","fund-sponsor":"H2020 European Research Council","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059704171"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059704171?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059704171&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059704171&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059704171","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85059704171","eid":"2-s2.0-85059704171","dc:title":"Three-dimensional pedestrian position estimation algorithm using waist-mounted IMU sensor","dc:creator":"Song J.W.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems","prism:issn":"19765622","prism:volume":"24","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"453-459","prism:coverDate":"2018-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2018","prism:doi":"10.5302/J.ICROS.2018.17.0217","dc:description":"This paper proposes a three-dimensional pedestrian position estimation algorithm using a waist-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor. A Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) system has been implemented using a single IMU sensor to locate a pedestrian who is carrying the PDR system on his waist in a building in which GPS signals are too weak to be utilized for localization. The position estimation system using IMU data suffers from degraded accuracy caused by the bias drift of gyroscope values. This approach adopts the quaternion to reduce the bias drift and obtain the precise Euler angles to localize the pedestrian in two-dimensional space with the step length estimation. To extend the localization into three-dimensional space to incorporate situations in which the pedestrian is ascending or descending the stairs, Zero-Velocity UpdaTe (ZUPT) scheme has been applied for processing gyroscope data from the IMU sensor.

With limited prior information of the uncooperative space targets, good parameters estimations will not only provide rich knowledge of the target but also figure out whether the uncooperative space target can be captured and controlled. Since the uncooperative targets are tumbling in space, only remote sensors (i.e. stereo camera and LIDAR) can be utilized to measure some useful information about them. However, under the uncertain space environment, the remote sensors sometimes cannot output reliable measurements and will lead to failures of the parameters estimations. This paper focuses on parameters estimations of an uncooperative space target with measurements failures. In this paper, a LIDAR device is used to obtain the relative pose between the target and the servicing satellite, and long-term measurements failures of the LIDAR is considered. To enhance the estimating accuracies and efficiencies, the dual vector quaternions (DVQ) are utilized to model the system kinematics and dynamics. By the novel DVQ modeling technique, both the translational and rotational parameters can be estimated in the same time. Also, by utilizing the dynamic models, the inertial parameters (ratios of the moments of inertia of the target, and the location of the center of mass) can also be estimated. In the beginning, a DVQ based extended Kalman filter is designed to estimate the parameters of the uncooperative space target when the measurements of the LIDAR are available. Then, to overcome the estimating failures caused by the faults of the LIDAR measurements, a neural network aided extended Kalman filter (NNEKF) is designed. In the designed NNEKF, a BP neural network is designed in the measurement update procedure when the measurements from the LIDAR are failed. By using the historical time propagations of the states and the Kalman gain as inputs together with the relative correct estimations of the states as outputs, the designed BP neural network is trained off-line firstly. Then, when the measurements of the LIDAR is available, the trained BP neural network is retrained by the results from the DVQ-EKF in each estimating step to enhance its online estimating accuracy. As soon as the measurements failures happen, the designed BP neural network will output the estimations of the parameters instead of the ones made by DVQ-EKF. When the measurements of the LIDAR are available again, the estimations of the designed BP neural network will be used to reset the DVQ-EKF, which will be used under available LIDAR measurements situations. By the proposed DVQ-NNEKF, the measurements update procedure can switch between the designed BP neural network and the EKF to enhance its accuracy due to the availabilities of the LIDAR measurements and mitigate the computational burden. Finally, the proposed DVQ-NNEKF is validated by mathematical simulations to show its robust performances.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003977","afid":"60003977","affilname":"Northwestern Polytechnical University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57196097017","authid":"57196097017","authname":"Hou X.","surname":"Hou","given-name":"Xianghao","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57224779766","authid":"57224779766","authname":"Yuan J.","surname":"Yuan","given-name":"Jianping","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]}],"source-id":"12376","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"614221003121703","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058616971"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058616971?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85058616971&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85058616971&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058616971","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85058616971","eid":"2-s2.0-85058616971","dc:title":"Parallel multi-core CPU and GPU for fast and robust medical image watermarking","dc:creator":"Hosny K.M.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Access","prism:eIssn":"21693536","prism:volume":"6","prism:pageRange":"77212-77225","prism:coverDate":"2018-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2018","prism:doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879919","dc:description":"Securing medical images are a very essential process in medical image authentication. Medical image watermarking is a very popular tool to achieve this goal. In this paper, an extremely fast, highly accurate, and robust algorithm is proposed for watermarking both gray-level and color medical images. In the proposed method, a scrambled binary watermark is embedded in the host medical image. Simplified exact kernels are used to compute the moments of the polar complex exponential transform (PCET) for the host gray-level images and the moments of the quaternion PCET for the host color images without approximation errors. The stability of the computed moments enables us to use higher order moments in a perfect reconstruction of the watermarked medical images. The accurate moment invariant to rotation, scaling, and translation ensures the robustness of the proposed watermarking algorithm against geometric attacks. Performed experiments clearly show very high visual imperceptibility and robustness to different levels of geometric distortions and common signal processing attacks. The implementation of parallel multi-core CPU and GPU result in a tremendous reduction of the overall watermarking times. For a color image of size 256 × 256, the watermarking time is accelerated by 20 × and 11 ×using a GPU and a CPU with 16 cores, respectively.","citedby-count":"39","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60274165","afid":"60274165","affilname":"Faculty of Computers and Information","affiliation-city":"Zagazig","affiliation-country":"Egypt"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60273131","afid":"60273131","affilname":"Faculty of Science","affiliation-city":"Asyut","affiliation-country":"Egypt"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032356","afid":"60032356","affilname":"Hunan University","affiliation-city":"Changsha","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205214086","authid":"57205214086","orcid":"0000-0001-8065-8977","authname":"Hosny K.M.","surname":"Hosny","given-name":"Khalid M.","initials":"K.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60274165"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205229124","authid":"57205229124","orcid":"0000-0003-3256-8728","authname":"Darwish M.M.","surname":"Darwish","given-name":"Mohamed M.","initials":"M.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60273131"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404988992","authid":"7404988992","authname":"Li K.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Kenli","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55586510800","authid":"55586510800","authname":"Salah A.","surname":"Salah","given-name":"Ahmad","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60274165"}]}],"authkeywords":"geometric attacks | GPU | Medical image watermarking | multi-core CPUs | parallel architecture | polar harmonic transforms | telemedicine","article-number":"8574023","source-id":"21100374601","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61602170","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058485734"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058485734?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85058485734&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85058485734&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058485734","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85058485734","eid":"2-s2.0-85058485734","dc:title":"Application of modified culture Kalman filter in bearing fault diagnosis","dc:creator":"Hailun W.","prism:publicationName":"Open Physics","prism:eIssn":"23915471","prism:volume":"16","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"757-765","prism:coverDate":"2018-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2018","prism:doi":"10.1515/phys-2018-0095","dc:description":"Rolling bearings are an important part of rotary machines.

Furthermore, by introducing Q-DIFF and Q-Markov in the proposed model, the entire architecture of the algorithm is accumulated in the four-dimensional frequency domain (i.e., all color channels of color images are utilized). Moreover, the experimental results on public domain benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model is superior to the other state-of-the-art splicing detection methods. Based on the experimental results, we suggest the direction that designs image tamper detection model, which invite all the processing in the model to operate in four-dimensional space (i.e. quaternion space).","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007711","afid":"60007711","affilname":"Jilin University","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203896995","authid":"57203896995","authname":"Sheng H.","surname":"Sheng","given-name":"Hongda","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402721669","authid":"7402721669","authname":"Shen X.","surname":"Shen","given-name":"Xuanjing","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188923911","authid":"57188923911","authname":"Shi Z.","surname":"Shi","given-name":"Zenan","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]}],"authkeywords":"Image splicing detection | Markov model | Quaternion domain","source-id":"25674","fund-no":"20180201064SF","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85057161836"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85057161836?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85057161836&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85057161836&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85057161836","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85057161836","eid":"2-s2.0-85057161836","dc:title":"A saliency-based object tracking method for UAV application","dc:creator":"Yang J.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783030033408"}],"prism:volume":"11259 LNCS","prism:pageRange":"115-125","prism:coverDate":"2018-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2018","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-03341-5_10","dc:description":"Visual tracking has been an active and complicated research area in computer vision for recent decades. In the area of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) application, establishing a robust tracking model is still a challenge. The kernelized correlation filter (KCF) is one of the state-of-the-art object trackers. However, it could not reasonably handle the severe special situations in UAV application during tracking process, especially when targets undergo significant appearance changes due to camera shaking or deformation. In this paper, we proposed a new compounded feature to track the object by combining saliency feature and color features for the conspicuousness of the objects in the videos captured by UAVs. Considering the speed of real-time application, we use a spectrum-based saliency detection method - quaternion type-II DCT image signatures. In addition, severe drifting can be detected and adjusted by the relocation mechanism. Extensive experiments on the UAV tracking sequences show that the proposed method significantly improves KCF, and achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art trackers.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013789","afid":"60013789","affilname":"Beihang University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008592","afid":"60008592","affilname":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202813184","authid":"57202813184","orcid":"0000-0002-9765-9009","authname":"Yang J.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Jinyu","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008592"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15833795300","authid":"15833795300","authname":"Ding W.","surname":"Ding","given-name":"Wenrui","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013789"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206078017","authid":"57206078017","authname":"Liu C.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Chunlei","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013789"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204786440","authid":"57204786440","authname":"Ha Z.","surname":"Ha","given-name":"Zechen","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013789"}]}],"authkeywords":"KCF | Object tracking | Saliency feature | UAV","source-id":"25674","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85057140328"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85057140328?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85057140328&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85057140328&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85057140328","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85057140328","eid":"2-s2.0-85057140328","dc:title":"Schubert decomposition for milnor fibers of the varieties of singular matrices","dc:creator":"Damon J.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Singularities","prism:issn":"19492006","prism:volume":"18","prism:pageRange":"358-396","prism:coverDate":"2018-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2018","prism:doi":"10.5427/jsing.2018.18s","dc:description":"We consider the varieties of singular m × m complex matrices which may be either general, symmetric or skew-symmetric (with m even). For these varieties we have shown in another paper that they had compact “model submanifolds” for the homotopy types of the Milnor fibers which are classical symmetric spaces in the sense of Cartan. In this paper we use these models, combined with results due to a number of authors concerning the Schubert decomposition of Lie groups and symmetric spaces via the Cartan model, together with Iwasawa decomposition, to give cell decompositions of the global Milnor fibers. The Schubert decomposition is in terms of “unique ordered factorizations” of matrices in the Milnor fibers as products of “pseudo-rotations”. In the case of symmetric or skew-symmetric matrices, this factorization has the form of iterated “Cartan conjugacies” by pseudo-rotations. The decomposition respects the towers of Milnor fibers and symmetric spaces ordered by inclusions. Furthermore, the “Schubert cycles”, which are the closures of the Schubert cells, are images of products of suspensions of projective spaces (complex, real, or quaternionic as appropriate). In the cases of general or skew-symmetric matrices the Schubert cycles have fundamental classes, and for symmetric matrices mod 2 classes, which give a basis for the homology. They are also shown to correspond to the cohomology generators for the symmetric spaces. For general matrices the duals of the Schubert cycles are represented as explicit monomials in the generators of the cohomology exterior algebra; and for symmetric matrices they are related to Stiefel-Whitney classes of an associated real vector bundle. Furthermore, for a matrix singularity of any of these types. the pull-backs of these cohomology classes generate a characteristic subalgebra of the cohomology of its Milnor fiber. We also indicate how these results extend to exceptional orbit hypersurfaces, complements and links, including a characteristic subalgebra of the cohomology of the complement of a matrix singularity.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025111","afid":"60025111","affilname":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","affiliation-city":"Chapel Hill","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003877709","authid":"7003877709","authname":"Damon J.","surname":"Damon","given-name":"James","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025111"}]}],"authkeywords":"Cartan conjugacy | Cartan model | Characteristic subalgebra | Classical symmetric spaces | Global milnor fibration | Iwasawa decomposition | Ordered symmetric and skew-symmetric factorizations | Pseudo-rotations | Schubert cycles | Schubert decomposition | Varieties of singular matrices","source-id":"21100203314","fund-acr":"NSF","fund-no":"DMS-1105470","fund-sponsor":"National Science Foundation","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055713651"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055713651?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85055713651&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85055713651&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055713651","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85055713651","eid":"2-s2.0-85055713651","dc:title":"Quaternion-based signal processing","dc:creator":"Witten B.","prism:publicationName":"Society of Exploration Geophysicists - SEG International Exposition and 76tth Annual Meeting 2006, SEG 2006","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781604236972"}],"prism:pageRange":"2862-2866","prism:coverDate":"2018-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2018","dc:description":"Hypercomlex numbers are primarily used for pattern recognition, offer many useful applications to geophysics.
