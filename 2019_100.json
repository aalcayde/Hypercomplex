Its computer-aided approach has attracted considerable attention in the field of digital pathology, which highly depends on the feature representation for histopathological images. The principal component analysis network (PCANet) is a novel unsupervised deep learning framework that has shown its effectiveness for feature representation learning. However, PCA is susceptible to noise and outliers to affect the performance of PCANet. The Grassmann average (GA) is superior to PCA on robustness. In this work, a GA network (GANet) algorithm is proposed by embedding GA algorithm into the PCANet framework. Moreover, since quaternion algebra is an excellent tool to represent color images, a quaternion-based GANet (QGANet) algorithm is further developed to learn effective feature representations containing color information for histopathological images. The experimental results based on three histopathological image datasets indicate that the proposed QGANet achieves the best performance on the classification of color histopathological images among all the compared algorithms.","citedby-count":"23","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023813","afid":"60023813","affilname":"Shanghai University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404495816","authid":"7404495816","authname":"Shi J.","surname":"Shi","given-name":"Jun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190219047","authid":"57190219047","authname":"Zheng X.","surname":"Zheng","given-name":"Xiao","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191708953","authid":"57191708953","authname":"Wu J.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Jinjie","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204002086","authid":"57204002086","authname":"Gong B.","surname":"Gong","given-name":"Bangming","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56841055400","authid":"56841055400","authname":"Zhang Q.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Qi","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24451523300","authid":"24451523300","orcid":"0000-0001-9423-0146","authname":"Ying S.","surname":"Ying","given-name":"Shihui","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color histopathological image | Principal component analysis network (PCANet) | Quaternion algebra | Quaternion Grassmann averages network (QGANet)","source-id":"24823","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"11471208","fund-sponsor":"Shanghai Science and Technology Development Foundation","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065579320"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065579320?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85065579320&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85065579320&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065579320","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85065579320","eid":"2-s2.0-85065579320","dc:title":"Quaternion orthogonal design based sphere decoder for MIMO systems","dc:creator":"Ranjitha M.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the 2019 IEEE International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing, ICCSP 2019","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538675953"}],"prism:pageRange":"621-625","prism:coverDate":"2019-04-23","prism:coverDisplayDate":"23 April 2019","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICCSP.2019.8698010","dc:description":"In Land Mobile Satellite Communication system, MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) Polarization Diversity along with spatial and temporal diversity is studied and analyzed.

Therefore, an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) data generator is mandatory to save the time of logging data and isolate the sensor errors. The IMU data generator is also more flexible in generating inertial data of different types of trajectory. An IMU generator contains a gyroscope data generator and an accelerometer data generator. In general, the gyroscope and acceleration data are generated by taking derivative of attitude and position. There are three different ways to generate gyroscope data depending on how the attitude is presented. This paper shows the practical problems, which alway present in the implementation of the IMU data generator. That is noise appearing in the derivative of input data. The method to remove derivative noise shows that the noise is rejected with maximum shape preservation of trajectory. Further, an investigation is carried out to show which methods should be used to generate the gyroscope data for maximum input motion preservation.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/119127613","afid":"119127613","affilname":"Viettel Research and Development Institute","affiliation-city":"Hanoi","affiliation-country":"Viet Nam"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55558523000","authid":"55558523000","authname":"Vu B.","surname":"Vu","given-name":"Bac Nghia","initials":"B.N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"119127613"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57208687069","authid":"57208687069","authname":"Nguyen K.","surname":"Nguyen","given-name":"Khanh Nhu","initials":"K.N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"119127613"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57208693489","authid":"57208693489","authname":"Vu M.","surname":"Vu","given-name":"Mung Huy","initials":"M.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"119127613"}]}],"authkeywords":"DCM | derivative noise | Euler | IMU generator | quaternion","article-number":"8696196","source-id":"21100905400","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055332460"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055332460?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85055332460&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85055332460&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055332460","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85055332460","eid":"2-s2.0-85055332460","dc:title":"Heuristics approach to speeding up saliency detection","dc:creator":"Rajankar O.S.","prism:publicationName":"Signal, Image and Video Processing","prism:issn":"18631703","prism:eIssn":"18631711","prism:volume":"13","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"465-473","prism:coverDate":"2019-04-03","prism:coverDisplayDate":"3 April 2019","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11760-018-1371-0","dc:description":"Visual saliency is the distinct perceptual quality which makes some subsets in an image stand out from their neighbours and immediately grab human attention in the early vision.

This study contains Pedestrian Dead-Reckoning (PDR) by aid of smartphone body-mounted Micro Electro-Mechanic (MEMS) without GPS usage. Quaternion based attitude estimation is used to avoid Euler integration singularity problem. Furthermore, attitude estimation with accelerometer/magnetometer and the quaternion attitude outputs is fused with Kalman Filter (KF) to get rid of gyroscope drift error.

Nowadays, the main alternative to the use of rotation matrices, to represent rotations in ℝ 3, is the use of Euler parameters arranged in quaternion form. Whereas the passage from a set of Euler parameters to the corresponding rotation matrix is unique and straightforward, the passage from a rotation matrix to its corresponding Euler parameters has been revealed to be somewhat tricky if numerical aspects are considered. Since the map from quaternions to 3 × 3 rotation matrices is a 2-to-1 covering map, this map cannot be smoothly inverted. As a consequence, it is erroneously assumed that all inversions should necessarily contain singularities that arise in the form of quotients where the divisor can be arbitrarily small. This misconception is herein clarified. This paper reviews the most representative methods available in the literature, including a comparative analysis of their computational costs and error performances. The presented analysis leads to the conclusion that Cayley's factorization, a little-known method used to compute the double quaternion representation of rotations in four dimensions from 4 × 4 rotation matrices, is the most robust method when particularized to three dimensions.","citedby-count":"18","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030064","afid":"60030064","affilname":"CSIC-UPC - Instituto de Robotica e Informatica Industrial (IRII)","affiliation-city":"Barcelona","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203984136","authid":"57203984136","authname":"Sarabandi S.","surname":"Sarabandi","given-name":"Soheil","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030064"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401929029","authid":"7401929029","authname":"Thomas F.","surname":"Thomas","given-name":"Federico","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030064"}]}],"article-number":"021006-1","source-id":"19700186816","fund-no":"DPI2014-57220-C2-2-P","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062471861"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062471861?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85062471861&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85062471861&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0300957218307548"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062471861","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85062471861","eid":"2-s2.0-85062471861","dc:title":"Development of a novel cardiopulmonary resuscitation measurement tool using real-time feedback from wearable wireless instrumentation","dc:creator":"Ward S.R.","prism:publicationName":"Resuscitation","prism:issn":"03009572","prism:eIssn":"18731570","prism:volume":"137","prism:pageRange":"183-189","prism:coverDate":"2019-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2019","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.resuscitation.2019.02.019","pii":"S0300957218307548","dc:description":"Aim: The design and implementation of a wearable training device to improve cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is presented. Methods: The MYO contains both Electromyography (EMG) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors which are used to detect effective CPR, and the four common incorrect hand and arm positions viz. relaxed fingers; hands too low on the sternum; patient too close; or patient too far. The device determines the rate and depth of compressions calculated using a Fourier transform and dual-quaternions respectively. In addition, common positional mistakes are determined using classification algorithms (six machine learning algorithms are considered and tested). Feedback via Graphical User Interface (GUI) and audio is integrated. Results: The system is tested by performing CPR on a mannequin and comparing real-time results to theoretical values. Tests show that although the classification algorithm performed well in testing (98%), in real time, it had low accuracy for certain categories (60%), which are attributable to the MYO calibration, sampling rate and misclassification of similar hand positions. Combining these similar incorrect positions into more general categories significantly improves accuracy, and produces the same improved outcome of improved CPR. The rate and depth measures have a general accuracy of 97%. Conclusion: The system allows for portable, real-time feedback for use in training and in the field, and shows promise toward classifying and improving the administration of CPR.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016218","afid":"60016218","affilname":"University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg","affiliation-city":"Johannesburg","affiliation-country":"South Africa"}],"pubmed-id":"30797861","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57207346724","authid":"57207346724","authname":"Ward S.R.","surname":"Ward","given-name":"Sarah R.","initials":"S.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016218"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57207360365","authid":"57207360365","authname":"Scott B.C.","surname":"Scott","given-name":"Bronwyn C.","initials":"B.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016218"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202307165","authid":"7202307165","authname":"Rubin D.M.","surname":"Rubin","given-name":"David M.","initials":"D.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016218"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35103120500","authid":"35103120500","authname":"Pantanowitz A.","surname":"Pantanowitz","given-name":"Adam","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016218"}]}],"authkeywords":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) | Dual-quaternions | Electromyogram (EMG) | Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) | Machine learning | MYO | Quality","source-id":"19064","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85061425376"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85061425376?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85061425376&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85061425376&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1051200418307723"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85061425376","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85061425376","eid":"2-s2.0-85061425376","dc:title":"Quaternionic rank-reduction methods for vector-field seismic data processing","dc:creator":"Bahia B.","prism:publicationName":"Digital Signal Processing: A Review Journal","prism:issn":"10512004","prism:volume":"87","prism:pageRange":"178-189","prism:coverDate":"2019-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2019","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.dsp.2019.02.001","pii":"S1051200418307723","dc:description":"The quaternion signal model can naturally represent vector-field data in a physically consistent approach, plausibly preserving and exploiting its vector relationships.

In this paper, the quaternion-defined seismic data is transformed to the frequency–space (f−x) domain via the quaternion Fourier transform (QFT), and rank-reduction can be performed via the quaternion SVD (QSVD) following the SSA methodology. Efficient rank-reduction alternatives, such as Lanczos bidiagonalization via convolutions, are used to allow significant gains in processing time.

However, this kind of methods need further detailed revision if users require fine colorization for delicate objects. This paper proposes a novel scribble-based colorization scheme which automatically generates scribbles and propagates color information from representative pixels within homogeneous superpixels. The scribbles are placed in the regions with minimal entropy to ensure color propagation from representative pixels with high confidence. To avoid color bleeding and under colorization, colors are propagated under a robust similarity metric using a set of hierarchical features, where the low level features consist of quaternion Gabor phases and the high level features are extracted using VGG-19 pre-trained deep model. Experimental results on open dataset demonstrate that the proposed colorization scheme can achieve more consistent results with the users’ purposes.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025084","afid":"60025084","affilname":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55754097300","authid":"55754097300","authname":"Chen C.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Changjian","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55695017800","authid":"55695017800","authname":"Xu Y.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Yi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7406503333","authid":"7406503333","authname":"Yang X.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Xiaokang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]}],"authkeywords":"Automatic scribble generation | Colorization | Hierarchical feature space | Segmentation | Similarity metric | Superpixel","source-id":"24306","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61671298","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058862643"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058862643?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85058862643&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85058862643&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058862643","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85058862643","eid":"2-s2.0-85058862643","dc:title":"Slice-polynomial functions and twistor geometry of ruled surfaces in CP <sup>3</sup>","dc:creator":"Altavilla A.","prism:publicationName":"Mathematische Zeitschrift","prism:issn":"00255874","prism:eIssn":"14321823","prism:volume":"291","prism:issueIdentifier":"3-4","prism:pageRange":"1059-1092","prism:coverDate":"2019-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 April 2019","prism:doi":"10.1007/s00209-018-2225-8","dc:description":"In the present paper we introduce the class of slice-polynomial functions: slice regular functions defined over the quaternions, outside the real axis, whose restriction to any complex half-plane is a polynomial.

To any slice-polynomial function P we associate its companionP ∨ and its extension to the real axis P R , that are quaternionic functions naturally related to P. Then, using the theory of twistor spaces, we are able to show that for any quaternion q the cardinality of simultaneous pre-images of q via P, P ∨ and P R is generically constant, giving a notion of degree. With the brand new tool of slice-polynomial functions, we compute the twistor discriminant locus of a cubic scroll C in CP 3 and we conclude by giving some qualitative results on the complex structures induced by C via the twistor projection.","citedby-count":"15","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027509","afid":"60027509","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Roma \"Tor Vergata\"","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021859","afid":"60021859","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Firenze","affiliation-city":"Florence","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56041637600","authid":"56041637600","authname":"Altavilla A.","surname":"Altavilla","given-name":"A.","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027509"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55509426200","authid":"55509426200","authname":"Sarfatti G.","surname":"Sarfatti","given-name":"G.","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021859"}]}],"authkeywords":"Functions of hypercomplex variables | Rational and ruled surfaces | Slice regular functions | Slice-polynomial functions | Twistor spaces","source-id":"25123","fund-acr":"INdAM","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica \"Francesco Severi\"","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85057801984"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85057801984?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85057801984&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85057801984&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0165168418303712"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85057801984","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85057801984","eid":"2-s2.0-85057801984","dc:title":"Color medical image lossless watermarking using chaotic system and accurate quaternion polar harmonic transforms","dc:creator":"Xia Z.","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing","prism:issn":"01651684","prism:volume":"157","prism:pageRange":"108-118","prism:coverDate":"2019-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2019","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.sigpro.2018.11.011","pii":"S0165168418303712","dc:description":"With the increasingly widespread use of medical images in medical institutions and networks, the copyright protection of medical images has become increasingly urgent. Since traditional embedded watermarking technology degrades the quality of the original images, it is not suitable for medical images. In addition, most medical watermarking algorithms are aimed at grayscale images; therefore, a smaller number of color medical image watermarking algorithms are available. In this paper, we propose a lossless watermarking scheme for color medical image copyright protection based on a chaotic system and quaternion polar harmonic transforms (QPHTs), which is a quaternion orthogonal moment method. In watermark embedding, we compute the QPHTs for the original color medical image and select accurate coefficients to construct a zero-watermark image. Then, the zero-watermark image is stored in the intellectual property right (IPR) database. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is robust to geometric attacks and common attacks and that it has better performance than similar lossless watermarking schemes. In addition, this paper details the selection of accurate coefficients for QPHTs and compares stability with different choices of unit pure quaternions.","citedby-count":"136","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029322","afid":"60029322","affilname":"Dalian Maritime University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011592","afid":"60011592","affilname":"Qilu University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Jinan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009806","afid":"60009806","affilname":"Lanzhou Jiaotong University","affiliation-city":"Lanzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004538","afid":"60004538","affilname":"Dalian University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188991071","authid":"57188991071","authname":"Xia Z.","surname":"Xia","given-name":"Zhiqiu","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9735589400","authid":"9735589400","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xingyuan","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029322"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57198624536","authid":"57198624536","authname":"Zhou W.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Wenjie","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009806"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56957405700","authid":"56957405700","authname":"Li R.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Rui","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55318994100","authid":"55318994100","orcid":"0000-0002-3742-5614","authname":"Wang C.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Chunpeng","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011592"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011592"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192071212","authid":"57192071212","authname":"Zhang C.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Chuan","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]}],"authkeywords":"Chaotic system | Color medical image | Geometric attacks | Lossless watermarking | Mixed linear-nonlinear coupled map lattice | Quaternion polar harmonic transforms","source-id":"25548","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"MMJJ20170203","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85056886034"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85056886034?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85056886034&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85056886034&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0031320318304023"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85056886034","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85056886034","eid":"2-s2.0-85056886034","dc:title":"New set of multi-channel orthogonal moments for color image representation and recognition","dc:creator":"Hosny K.M.","prism:publicationName":"Pattern Recognition","prism:issn":"00313203","prism:volume":"88","prism:pageRange":"153-173","prism:coverDate":"2019-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2019","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.patcog.2018.11.014","pii":"S0031320318304023","dc:description":"Orthogonal moments and their invariants to similarity transformations for monochrome and gray-scale images are widely used in many pattern recognition and image processing applications.

In this paper, a new set of multi-channel orthogonal moments and their invariants to rotation, scaling and translation (RST) is proposed for color image representation and recognition. The proposed multi-channel moments are based on the orthogonal radial substituted Chebyshev functions. The multi-channel orthogonal radial substituted Chebyshev moments (MORSCMs) are defined in polar coordinates over a unit circle. An accurate kernel-based method is utilized for accurate computation of the MORSCMs. A series of experiments is performed to validate this new set of multi-channel moments and compare its performance with the existing quaternion and multi-channel orthogonal moments. The obtained results ensure the superiority of the proposed MORSCMs over all existing moments in representation and recognition of the color images.","citedby-count":"49","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60274165","afid":"60274165","affilname":"Faculty of Computers and Information","affiliation-city":"Zagazig","affiliation-country":"Egypt"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60273131","afid":"60273131","affilname":"Faculty of Science","affiliation-city":"Asyut","affiliation-country":"Egypt"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205214086","authid":"57205214086","orcid":"0000-0001-8065-8977","authname":"Hosny K.M.","surname":"Hosny","given-name":"Khalid M.","initials":"K.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60274165"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205229124","authid":"57205229124","authname":"Darwish M.M.","surname":"Darwish","given-name":"Mohamed M.","initials":"M.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60273131"}]}],"authkeywords":"Chebyshev rational moments | Color image reconstruction | Multi-channel orthogonal moments | Quaternion orthogonal moments | Recognition rates | RST","source-id":"24823","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054524705"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054524705?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85054524705&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85054524705&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054524705","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85054524705","eid":"2-s2.0-85054524705","dc:title":"Unsupervised Hierarchical Land Classification Using Self-Organizing Feature Codebook for Decimeter-Resolution PolSAR","dc:creator":"Kim H.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","prism:issn":"01962892","prism:volume":"57","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"1894-1905","prism:coverDate":"2019-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2019","prism:doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2018.2870134","dc:description":"In this paper, we propose a hierarchical polarization feature generation using a self-organizing codebook to realize unsupervised land classification that fully utilizes the detailed polarization information contained in high-resolution polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data. PolSAR has reached a decimeter-level high resolution. In general, conventional methods lower the resolution of the PolSAR data to 10-20 m in the real-space distance to classify observation regions into land classes such as farm, forest, and town. However, lowering resolution prevents us from discovering new land classes potentially enabled by the resolution enhancement. The hierarchical method we propose here not only classifies observation regions successfully into land classes such as farm, forest, and town that humans can naturally distinguish but also discovers new land subclasses findable only in high-resolution PolSAR data. We explain these two types of our achievements (classification/discovery) through experimental results for Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's polarimetric and interferometric airborne SAR-L2 data having decimeter resolution.","citedby-count":"13","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025272","afid":"60025272","affilname":"The University of Tokyo","affiliation-city":"Tokyo","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191717884","authid":"57191717884","orcid":"0000-0002-5194-0372","authname":"Kim H.","surname":"Kim","given-name":"Hyunsoo","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025272"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35416951600","authid":"35416951600","orcid":"0000-0002-6936-9733","authname":"Hirose A.","surname":"Hirose","given-name":"Akira","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025272"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025272"}]}],"authkeywords":"Autoencoder | hierarchical polarization feature | high-resolution | Poincare parameter | polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) | quaternion neural network | self-organizing map (SOM) | unsupervised land classification","article-number":"8480441","source-id":"17360","fund-acr":"KAKEN","fund-no":"15H02756","fund-sponsor":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85053476834"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85053476834?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85053476834&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85053476834&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85053476834","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85053476834","eid":"2-s2.0-85053476834","dc:title":"Fractional quaternion cosine transform and its application in color image copy-move forgery detection","dc:creator":"Chen B.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","prism:issn":"13807501","prism:eIssn":"15737721","prism:volume":"78","prism:issueIdentifier":"7","prism:pageRange":"8057-8073","prism:coverDate":"2019-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 April 2019","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11042-018-6595-z","dc:description":"In this paper, fractional quaternion cosine transforms (FrQCT) is proposed to generalize the conventional fractional cosine transforms (FrCT) to quaternion signal processing in a holistic manner.

Experimental results on two public datasets (FAU dataset and GRIP dataset) demonstrate that: (a) the proposed efficient implementation method takes only half the computational time of the direct method; (b) the proposed FrQCT-based forgery detection algorithm can achieve a better performance than some state-of-the-art algorithms, especially in the additional operation case.","citedby-count":"25","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073726","afid":"60073726","affilname":"Ludong University","affiliation-city":"Yantai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073460","afid":"60073460","affilname":"China University of Mining and Technology","affiliation-city":"Xuzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143","afid":"60064143","affilname":"Nanjing University of Information Science &amp; Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36805188500","authid":"36805188500","orcid":"0000-0002-2506-0427","authname":"Chen B.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Beijing","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55286480600","authid":"55286480600","authname":"Yu M.","surname":"Yu","given-name":"Ming","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26633246300","authid":"26633246300","authname":"Su Q.","surname":"Su","given-name":"Qingtang","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073726"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55839736400","authid":"55839736400","authname":"Li L.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Leida","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073460"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image | Fractional cosine transform | Image forgery detection | Quaternion","source-id":"25627","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61572258","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85052695388"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85052695388?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85052695388&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85052695388&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85052695388","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85052695388","eid":"2-s2.0-85052695388","dc:title":"Quatnet: Quaternion-based head pose estimation with multiregression loss","dc:creator":"Hsu H.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","prism:issn":"15209210","prism:volume":"21","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"1035-1046","prism:coverDate":"2019-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2019","prism:doi":"10.1109/TMM.2018.2866770","dc:description":"Head pose estimation has attracted immense research interest recently, as its inherent information significantly improves the performance of face-related applications such as face alignment and face recognition. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth study of head pose estimation and present a multiregression loss function, an L2 regression loss combined with an ordinal regression loss, to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is dedicated to estimating head poses from RGB images without depth information. The ordinal regression loss is utilized to address the nonstationary property observed as the facial features change with respect to different head pose angles and learn robust features. The L2 regression loss leverages these features to provide precise angle predictions for input images. To avoid the ambiguity problem in the commonly used Euler angle representation, we further formulate the head pose estimation problem in quaternions. Our quaternion-based multiregression loss method achieves state-of-The-Art performance on the AFLW2000, AFLW test set, and AFW datasets and is closing the gap with methods that utilize depth information on the BIWI dataset.","citedby-count":"89","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708","afid":"60012708","affilname":"Stanford University","affiliation-city":"Palo Alto","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012370","afid":"60012370","affilname":"National Chiao Tung University","affiliation-city":"Hsinchu","affiliation-country":"Taiwan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203714241","authid":"57203714241","orcid":"0000-0003-2947-0519","authname":"Hsu H.","surname":"Hsu","given-name":"Heng Wei","initials":"H.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012370"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57089414500","authid":"57089414500","authname":"Wu T.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Tung Yu","initials":"T.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012708"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203712807","authid":"57203712807","orcid":"0000-0002-8483-5667","authname":"Wan S.","surname":"Wan","given-name":"Sheng","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012370"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403972659","authid":"7403972659","orcid":"0000-0001-7466-2339","authname":"Wong W.","surname":"Wong","given-name":"Wing Hung","initials":"W.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012708"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55934856300","authid":"55934856300","authname":"Lee C.","surname":"Lee","given-name":"Chen Yi","initials":"C.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012370"}]}],"authkeywords":"Convolutional neural network (CNN) | head pose estimation | ordinal regression | quaternion","article-number":"8444061","source-id":"16211","fund-no":"105-2218-E-009-001/107W210","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85051679190"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85051679190?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85051679190&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85051679190&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85051679190","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85051679190","eid":"2-s2.0-85051679190","dc:title":"Surfaces containing two circles through each point","dc:creator":"Skopenkov M.","prism:publicationName":"Mathematische Annalen","prism:issn":"00255831","prism:volume":"373","prism:issueIdentifier":"3-4","prism:pageRange":"1299-1327","prism:coverDate":"2019-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 April 2019","prism:doi":"10.1007/s00208-018-1739-z","dc:description":"We find all analytic surfaces in 3-dimensional Euclidean space such that through each point of the surface one can draw two transversal circular arcs fully contained in the surface (and analytically depending on the point).

Then, construct the MQWLDH to extract spatial features based on those first three PCs. The proposed method uses the algebraic structure of quaternions to unify the process of processing the first three PCs, which reduces the computational cost and the dimensionality of the extracted spatial feature vector. Moreover, the constructed quaternion Weber local descriptor effectively characterizes the variations of each pixel neighborhood and detects the edges of HSIs. To capture more intrinsic spatial information contained in homogeneous regions of different sizes and shapes, multiscale feature histograms are constructed. Finally, a feature fusion framework is proposed to fuse spectral and spatial features so that spectral information can be fully utilized.

A new attitude calculation algorithm of quadrotor with adaptive error quaternion unscented Kalman filter is proposed. Following the traditional unscented Kalman filter algorithm, this algorithm combines the gyroscope drift error model and chooses the error quaternion to construct the state equation of the unscented Kalman filter. The measurement equation of the unscented Kalman filter is constructed by using the output signal of accelerometer and magnetometer. Adjusting the noise covariance matrix adaptively, the influence of non-gravity acceleration on attitude calculation is reduced. Experiment shows that when the quadrotor has non gravity acceleration, the algorithm can effectively reduce the influence of non-gravity acceleration shadow on the attitude calculation.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021666","afid":"60021666","affilname":"Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209293369","authid":"57209293369","authname":"Cui P.","surname":"Cui","given-name":"Peilin","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34878194800","authid":"34878194800","authname":"Zhou Z.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Zhaihe","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56651981200","authid":"56651981200","authname":"Lü P.","surname":"Lü","given-name":"Pin","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57225868967","authid":"57225868967","authname":"Hu B.","surname":"Hu","given-name":"Bin","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021666"}]}],"authkeywords":"Error quaternion | Non-gravity acceleration | Quadrotor | Unscented Kalman filter","source-id":"26196","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059522317"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059522317?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059522317&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059522317&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0925231218314887"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059522317","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85059522317","eid":"2-s2.0-85059522317","dc:title":"Quaternion-based weighted nuclear norm minimization for color image denoising","dc:creator":"Yu Y.","prism:publicationName":"Neurocomputing","prism:issn":"09252312","prism:eIssn":"18728286","prism:volume":"332","prism:pageRange":"283-297","prism:coverDate":"2019-03-07","prism:coverDisplayDate":"7 March 2019","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.neucom.2018.12.034","pii":"S0925231218314887","dc:description":"The quaternion method plays an important role in color image processing, because it represents the color image as a whole rather than as a separate color space component, thus naturally handling the coupling among color channels. The weighted nuclear norm minimization (WNNM) scheme assigns different weights to different singular values, leading to more reasonable image representation method. In this paper, we propose a novel quaternion weighted nuclear norm minimization (QWNNM) model and algorithm under the low rank sparse framework. The proposed model represents the color image as a low rank quaternion matrix, where quaternion singular value decomposition can be calculated by its equivalent complex matrix. We solve the QWNNM by adaptively assigning different singular values with different weights. Color image denoising is implemented by QWNNM based on non-local similarity priors. In this new color space, the inherent color structure can be well preserved during image reconstruction. For high noise levels, we apply a Gaussian low pass filter (LPF) to the noisy image as a preprocessing before QWNNM, which reduces the iteration numbers and improves the denoised results. The experimental results clearly show that the proposed method outperforms K-SVD, QKSVD and WNNM in terms of both quantitative criteria and visual perceptual.","citedby-count":"24","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021751","afid":"60021751","affilname":"Wuyi University","affiliation-city":"Wuyishan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56026129100","authid":"56026129100","orcid":"0000-0003-0120-127X","authname":"Yu Y.","surname":"Yu","given-name":"Yibin","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021751"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221366126","authid":"57221366126","authname":"Zhang Y.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Yulan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021751"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55455311900","authid":"55455311900","authname":"Yuan S.","surname":"Yuan","given-name":"Shifang","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021751"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image denoising | Low rank | Non-local similarity priors | Quaternion singular value decomposition | Quaternion weighted nuclear norm minimization","source-id":"24807","fund-acr":"DEGP","fund-no":"2015A030313646","fund-sponsor":"Department of Education of Guangdong Province","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063539329"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063539329?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85063539329&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85063539329&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063539329","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85063539329","eid":"2-s2.0-85063539329","dc:title":"Hypercomplex Principal Component Pursuit via Convex Optimization","dc:creator":"Mizoguchi T.","prism:publicationName":"2018 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference, APSIPA ASC 2018 - Proceedings","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789881476852"}],"prism:pageRange":"579-586","prism:coverDate":"2019-03-04","prism:coverDisplayDate":"4 March 2019","prism:doi":"10.23919/APSIPA.2018.8659550","dc:description":"Expressing multidimensional information as a value in hypercomplex number systems (e.g., quaternion, octonion, etc.) has great potential, in signal processing applications, to enjoy their nontrivial algebraic benefits which are not available in standard real or complex vector systems. Exploiting sparsity of hypercomplex matrices or vectors would play an important role in utilizing such benefits. In this paper, we propose a new sparsity measure for evaluating sparsity of hypercomplex matrices. With utilizing this measure, the hypercomplex robust principal component analysis can be relaxed into the hypercomplex robust principal component pursuit and it can be reduced to a real convex optimization problem. We then derive an algorithmic solution to the hypercomplex principal component pursuit based on a proximal splitting technique. Numerical experiments are performed in the octonion domain and show that the proposed algorithm outperforms a part-wise state-of-art real, complex and quaternion algorithm.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031126","afid":"60031126","affilname":"Tokyo Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tokyo","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55967323300","authid":"55967323300","authname":"Mizoguchi T.","surname":"Mizoguchi","given-name":"Takehiko","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031126"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35486046100","authid":"35486046100","authname":"Yamada I.","surname":"Yamada","given-name":"Isao","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031126"}]}],"article-number":"8659550","source-id":"21100902102","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
