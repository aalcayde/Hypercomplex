Vizing's theorem states that the edge colouring of a simple graph G requires either Δ or Δ+1 colours, where Δ is the maximum vertex degree of G. Holyer proved that it is NP-complete to decide whether G is Δ-edge colourable even for cubic graphs. By introducing the concept of complex coloured edges, we show that the colour-exchange operation of complex colours follows the same multiplication rules as quaternion. An initially Δ-edge-coloured graph G allows variable-coloured edges, which can be eliminated by colour exchanges in a manner similar to variable eliminations in solving systems of linear equations. The problem is solved if all variables are eliminated and a properly Δ-edge-coloured graph is reached. For Δ-regular uniform random graphs, we prove that our algorithm returns a proper Δ-edge colouring with a probability of 1-1/n in time if G is Δ-edge colourable. Otherwise, the algorithm halts in polynomial time and signals the impossibility of a solution, meaning that the chromatic index of G probably equals Δ+1. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025084","afid":"60025084","affilname":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002798","afid":"60002798","affilname":"Chinese University of Hong Kong","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7501439403","authid":"7501439403","authname":"Lee T.","surname":"Lee","given-name":"Tony T.","initials":"T.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002798"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36344236300","authid":"36344236300","authname":"Wan Y.","surname":"Wan","given-name":"Yujie","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002798"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55578266100","authid":"55578266100","authname":"Guan H.","surname":"Guan","given-name":"Hao","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002798"}]}],"authkeywords":"colour exchange | edge colouring | incidence graph | Kempe path","source-id":"28494","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"414012","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84872679307"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84872679307?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84872679307&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84872679307&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84872679307","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84872679307","eid":"2-s2.0-84872679307","dc:title":"On Certain Kähler Quotients of Quaternionic Kähler Manifolds","dc:creator":"Cortés V.","prism:publicationName":"Communications in Mathematical Physics","prism:issn":"00103616","prism:eIssn":"14320916","prism:volume":"317","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"787-816","prism:coverDate":"2013-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"February 2013","prism:doi":"10.1007/s00220-012-1541-9","dc:description":"We prove that, given a certain isometric action of a two-dimensional Abelian group A on a quaternionic Kähler manifold M which preserves a submanifold N ⊂ M, the quotient M′ = N/A has a natural Kähler structure.

The color of an object varies according to the spectral power distribution, object-illumination, and viewing geometry of the light source. The quaternion representation of color is shown to be effective, which treats color channels as single unit rather than separate components. New texture signatures are extracted by calculating the norm of the Quaternion fourier spectrum. These signatures are proved to be invariant under image rotation and illumination rotation. Moreover, these features are also invariant to the color spaces. The robustness of different color spaces against varying illumination in color Texture classification with 45 samples of 15 outex texture classes are examined.

It is a challenging work to design a robust color image watermarking scheme. Based on quaternion Fourier transform and least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), we propose a robust blind color image watermarking in quaternion Fourier transform domain, which has good visual quality. Firstly, the original color image is divided into color image blocks. Then, the fast quaternion Fourier transform is performed on the color image block. Finally, the digital watermark is embedded into original color image by adaptively modulating the real quaternion Fourier transform coefficients of color image block. For watermark decoding, the LS-SVM correction with pseudo-Zernike moments is utilized. Experimental results show that the proposed color image watermarking is not only robust against common image processing operations such as filtering, JPEG compression, histogram equalization, and image blurring, but also robust against the geometrical distortions. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","citedby-count":"112","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025256","afid":"60025256","affilname":"Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017010","afid":"60017010","affilname":"Liaoning Normal University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972239800","authid":"34972239800","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiang Yang","initials":"X.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55318994100","authid":"55318994100","authname":"Wang C.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Chun Peng","initials":"C.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972350300","authid":"34972350300","authname":"Yang H.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Hong Ying","initials":"H.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16205443400","authid":"16205443400","authname":"Niu P.","surname":"Niu","given-name":"Pan Pan","initials":"P.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color attack | Color image watermarking | Geometric distortion | Least squares support vector machine | Quaternion Fourier transform","source-id":"19309","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84870779499"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84870779499?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84870779499&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84870779499&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1090780712003631"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84870779499","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84870779499","eid":"2-s2.0-84870779499","dc:title":"Formalism for hypercomplex multidimensional NMR employing partial-component subsampling","dc:creator":"Schuyler A.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Magnetic Resonance","prism:issn":"10907807","prism:eIssn":"10960856","prism:volume":"227","prism:pageRange":"20-24","prism:coverDate":"2013-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"February 2013","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jmr.2012.11.019","pii":"S1090780712003631","dc:description":"Multidimensional NMR spectroscopy typically employs phase-sensitive detection, which results in hypercomplex data (and spectra) when utilized in more than one dimension. Nonuniform sampling approaches have become commonplace in multidimensional NMR, enabling dramatic reductions in experiment time, increases in sensitivity and/or increases in resolution. In order to utilize nonuniform sampling optimally, it is necessary to characterize the relationship between the spectrum of a uniformly sampled data set and the spectrum of a subsampled data set. In this work we construct an algebra of hypercomplex numbers suitable for representing multidimensional NMR data along with partial-component nonuniform sampling (i.e. the hypercomplex components of data points are subsampled). This formalism leads to a modified DFT-Convolution relationship involving a partial-component, hypercomplex point-spread function set. The framework presented here is essential for the continued development and appropriate characterization of partial-component nonuniform sampling.© 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, a non-encoding fringe strategy is presented for large field 3D shape measurement under infrared light illumination. By utilizing the images recorded from several different orientations, the break and dislocation problems can be effectively solved by an algorithm of automatic identification and matching for out-of-plane height curves based on Euclid distance and quaternion. Meanwhile, the field of view can also be enlarged by prolonging the fringes in the edge areas. The examples of retrieving 3D shapes of the statues demonstrate the validation of the proposed approach.

Our approach is based on the most important AF, the up(x) function. The main reason to use the atomic function up(x) is that this function can express analytically multiple operations commonly used in image processing such as low-pass filtering, derivatives, local phase, and multiscale and steering filters. Therefore, the modelling process in low level-processing becomes easy using this function. The quaternionic algebra can be used in image analysis because lines (even), edges (odd) and the symmetry of some geometric objects in R2 are enhanced. The applications show an example of how up(x) can be applied in some basic operations in image processing and for quaternionic phase computation.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018216","afid":"60018216","affilname":"CINVESTAV Unidad Guadalajara","affiliation-city":"Guadalajara","affiliation-country":"Mexico"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book","subtype":"ch","subtypeDescription":"Book Chapter","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36667039500","authid":"36667039500","authname":"Moya-Sanchez E.","surname":"Moya-Sanchez","given-name":"E.

The new general form of the OPS split allows us to find new geometric interpretations for the action of the QFT on the signal.

The notes by Laurent Berger provide an introduction to p-adic Galois representations and Fontaine rings, which are especially useful for describing many local deformation rings at p that arise naturally in Galois deformation theory. The notes by Gebhard Böckle offer a comprehensive course on Galois deformation theory, starting from the foundational results of Mazur and discussing in detail the theory of pseudo-representations and their deformations, local deformations at places l ? p and local deformations at p which are flat. In the last section,the results of Böckle and Kisin on presentations of global deformation rings over local ones are discussed. The notes by Mladen Dimitrov present the basics of the arithmetic theory of Hilbert modular forms and varieties, with an emphasis on the study of the images of the attached Galois representations, on modularity lifting theorems over totally real number fields, and on the cohomology of Hilbert modular varieties with integral coefficients. The notes by Lassina Dembélé and John Voight describe methods for performing explicit computations in spaces of Hilbert modular forms. These methods depend on the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence and on computations in spaces of quaternionic modular forms, both for the case of definite and indefinite quaternion algebras. Several examples are given, and applications to modularity of Galois representations are discussed. The notes by Tim Dokchitser describe the proof, obtained by the author in a joint project with Vladimir Dokchitser, of the parity conjecture for elliptic curves over number fields under the assumption of finiteness of the Tate-Shafarevich group.

The signals considered are one-dimensional (1D), complex-valued, with possible correlation between the real and imaginary parts, i.e., improper complex signals. As a consequence, it is well known that the 'classical' (complex-valued) Fourier transform does not exhibit Hermitian symmetry and also that it is necessary to consider simultaneously the spectrum and the pseudo-spectrum to completely characterize such signals. Hence, an 'augmented' representation is necessary. However, this does not provide a geometric analysis of the complex improper signal. We propose another approach for the analysis of improper complex signals based on the use of a 1D Quaternion Fourier Transform (QFT). In the case where complex signals are non-stationary, we investigate the extension of the well-known 'analytic signal' and introduce the quaternion-valued 'hyperanalytic signal'. As with the hypercomplex two-dimensional (2D) extension of the analytic signal proposed by Bulow in 2001, our extension of analytic signals for complex-valued signals can be obtained by the inverse QFT of the quaternion-valued spectrum after suppressing negative frequencies. Analysis of the hyperanalytic signal reveals the time-varying frequency content of the corresponding complex signal. Using two different representations of quaternions, we show how modulus and quaternion angles of the hyperanalytic signal are linked to geometric features of the complex signal. This allows the definition of the angular velocity and the complex envelope of a complex signal. These concepts are illustrated on synthetic signal examples. The hyperanalytic signal can be seen as the exact counterpart of the classical analytic signal, and should be thought of as the very first and simplest quaternionic time-frequency representation for improper non-stationary complex-valued signals.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104170","afid":"60104170","affilname":"Grenoble Images Parole Signal Automatique","affiliation-city":"Saint Martin d'Heres","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001359","afid":"60001359","affilname":"University of Essex","affiliation-city":"Colchester","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book","subtype":"ch","subtypeDescription":"Book Chapter","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6507015909","authid":"6507015909","authname":"Le Bihan N.","surname":"Le Bihan","given-name":"Nicolas","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104170"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003346836","authid":"7003346836","authname":"Sangwine S.","surname":"Sangwine","given-name":"Stephen J.","initials":"S.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001359"}]}],"authkeywords":"Analytic signal | Complex signals | Fourier transform | Quaternions","source-id":"21100830496","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84950155786"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84950155786?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84950155786&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84950155786&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84950155786","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84950155786","eid":"2-s2.0-84950155786","dc:title":"Analytic video (2D + t) signals using Clifford-Fourier transforms in multiquaternion Grassmann- Hamilton-Clifford algebras","dc:creator":"Girard P.","prism:publicationName":"Quaternion and Clifford Fourier Transforms and Wavelets","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783034806039"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783034806022"}],"prism:pageRange":"197-219","prism:coverDate":"2013-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 January 2013","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-0348-0603-9","dc:description":"We present an algebraic framework for (2D +t) video analytic signals and a numerical implementation thereof using Clifford biquaternions and Clifford-Fourier transforms.

And by using control points which have both image coordinate and object coordinate, the solving equation from geometric correction model can be established and the bias matrix can be calculated by adjustment strategy.

The system is designed for pedestrian tracking within an uncontrolled environment and employs a quaternion-based attitude representation within the filter state. The attitude is cloned and kept between lower rate VO samples, while inertial data is processed in real-time with a higher sampling rate. Corresponding to the same time span, the relative orientation from the VO is used to correct the IMU-based rotation difference between the cloned and the current attitude. The information of magnetic compass is included in order to improve the heading estimation along with the mechanism for magnetic disturbance compensation. The filter scheme is extended by implementing the INS mechanization equations for position estimation, where the VO data is used as a velocity observation to reduce the growth of the rate of the position error. The performance of the designed SC-UKF is compared to the one of SC-based Extended Kalman filter on a number of representative walking paths. The augmented system shows a better performance especially for the indoor segments such as corridors with insufficient illumination and stairs with monotone walls. © 2013 IEEE.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60102538","afid":"60102538","affilname":"Karlsruher Institut für Technologie","affiliation-city":"Karlsruhe","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025641","afid":"60025641","affilname":"Universität Freiburg","affiliation-city":"Freiburg im Breisgau","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113098915","afid":"113098915","affilname":"Hahn-Schickard-Gesellschaft Institute of Microsystems and Information Technology (HSG-IMIT)","affiliation-city":"Villingen-Schwenningen","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56200961300","authid":"56200961300","authname":"Amirhosseini S.","surname":"Amirhosseini","given-name":"Sara Fazel","initials":"S.F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113098915"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36716942200","authid":"36716942200","authname":"Romanovas M.","surname":"Romanovas","given-name":"Michailas","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113098915"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36731389900","authid":"36731389900","authname":"Schwarze T.","surname":"Schwarze","given-name":"Tobias","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55605475300","authid":"55605475300","authname":"Schwaab M.","surname":"Schwaab","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113098915"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36716816800","authid":"36716816800","authname":"Traechtler M.","surname":"Traechtler","given-name":"Martin","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113098915"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004125957","authid":"7004125957","authname":"Manoli Y.","surname":"Manoli","given-name":"Yiannos","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113098915"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025641"}]}],"authkeywords":"Inertial Measurement Unit | Pedestrian Tracking | Stochastic Cloning | Unscented Kalman Filter | Visual Odometry","article-number":"6817893","source-id":"21100318404","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84901300984"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84901300984?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84901300984&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84901300984&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84901300984","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84901300984","eid":"2-s2.0-84901300984","dc:title":"An adaptive diffusion quaternion LMS algorithm for distributed networks of 3D and 4D vector sensors","dc:creator":"Jahanchahi C.","prism:publicationName":"European Signal Processing Conference","prism:issn":"22195491","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780992862602"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2013-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2013","dc:description":"A diffusion widely linear quaternion least mean square (D-WLIQLMS) algorithm for the collaborative processing of quaternion signals over distributed networks is proposed.

The proposed gradient mechanism is based on measuring the squared local contrast variation of a color image function, in which the chromatic variation is evaluated by quaternion representation. As an application in color image processing, we apply the proposed gradient operator to the traditional grayscale image Canny operator for color edge detection. The edge detection results indicate that the proposed color gradient operator is superior to other state-of-the-art color image gradient methods. © 2013 IEEE.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025761","afid":"60025761","affilname":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15922652500","authid":"15922652500","authname":"Jin L.","surname":"Jin","given-name":"Lianghai","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23767272300","authid":"23767272300","authname":"Song E.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Enmin","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56104314900","authid":"56104314900","authname":"Li L.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Lei","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189218464","authid":"57189218464","authname":"Li X.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Xiang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]}],"authkeywords":"color image | edge detection | Gradient | quaternion","article-number":"6738626","source-id":"21100293204","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84897769013"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84897769013?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84897769013&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84897769013&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84897769013","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84897769013","eid":"2-s2.0-84897769013","dc:title":"Perceptual hashing of color images using hypercomplex representations","dc:creator":"Laradji I.H.","prism:publicationName":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, ICIP 2013 - Proceedings","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781479923410"}],"prism:pageRange":"4402-4406","prism:coverDate":"2013-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2013","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2013.6738907","dc:description":"This paper presents a new perceptual image hashing approach that exploits the image color information using hypercomplex (quaternionic) representations. Unlike grayscale-based techniques, the proposed approach preserves the color interaction between the image components that have a significant contribution in the generated perceptual image hash codes. Having a robust image hash function optimizes a wide range of applications including content-based retrieval, image authentication, and image watermarking. Initially, the input color image is processed in a 'holistic' manner using the hypercomplex representation where the red, green and blue (RGB) components are handled as a single entity. Then, non-overlapping 8 × 8 image blocks are processed using the Quaternion Fourier transform (QFT). Binary image hash codes are generated by comparing the block mean frequency energy to the global mean frequency energy. For retrieval purposes, the Hamming distance (HD) is used as the comparison metric to retrieve perceptually similar images. The performance of the proposed perceptual hashing for color image is compared to that based on the conventional complex Fourier transform (CFT). Simulation results clearly indicate the superior retrieval performance of the proposed QFT-based perceptual hashing technique in term of HD values of intra-and inter-class image samples. Moreover, the performance improvement of the QFT-based technique is achieved at a computational complexity similar to the CFT-based scheme. © 2013 IEEE.","citedby-count":"27","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009506","afid":"60009506","affilname":"King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals","affiliation-city":"Dhahran","affiliation-country":"Saudi Arabia"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56104453400","authid":"56104453400","authname":"Laradji I.H.","surname":"Laradji","given-name":"Issam H.","initials":"I.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009506"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12796039800","authid":"12796039800","authname":"Ghouti L.","surname":"Ghouti","given-name":"Lahouari","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009506"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56103756700","authid":"56103756700","authname":"Khiari E.H.","surname":"Khiari","given-name":"El Hebri","initials":"E.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009506"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color Images | Hash Codes | Hypercomplex Fourier Transforms | Perceptual Hashing | Quaternions","article-number":"6738907","source-id":"21100293204","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84897748166"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84897748166?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84897748166&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84897748166&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84897748166","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84897748166","eid":"2-s2.0-84897748166","dc:title":"Vector mathematical morphological operators based on fuzzy extremum estimation","dc:creator":"Lei T.","prism:publicationName":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, ICIP 2013 - Proceedings","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781479923410"}],"prism:pageRange":"3031-3034","prism:coverDate":"2013-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2013","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2013.6738624","dc:description":"Two fundamental problems in vector extremum estimation based on lexicographical ordering are investigated in this paper.

And the second is that the lexicographical ordering only depends on the first component which leads to the followed components taking no effect. To solve the two problems, three novel marginal components are presented by means of the quaternion description of a color image. Moreover, a new fuzzy extremum estimation algorithm (FEEA) is also proposed and applied to vector ordering. Comparing with the existing solutions, experimental results show that the proposed FEEA has better effect on vector extremum estimation, and the presented frame of vector mathematical morphology can be used to process color image and provide better result. © 2013 IEEE.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009806","afid":"60009806","affilname":"Lanzhou Jiaotong University","affiliation-city":"Lanzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003977","afid":"60003977","affilname":"Northwestern Polytechnical University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36602820500","authid":"36602820500","authname":"Lei T.","surname":"Lei","given-name":"Tao","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009806"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12782205200","authid":"12782205200","authname":"Fan Y.","surname":"Fan","given-name":"Yangyu","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55559153400","authid":"55559153400","authname":"Zhang C.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Chenrui","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7501858561","authid":"7501858561","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiaopeng","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009806"}]}],"authkeywords":"color image processing | lexicographical ordering | quaternion decomposition | vector mathematical morphology","article-number":"6738624","source-id":"21100293204","fund-no":"2012M521801","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84897586282"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84897586282?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84897586282&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84897586282&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84897586282","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84897586282","eid":"2-s2.0-84897586282","dc:title":"Quaternion gyrator transform and its application to color image encryption","dc:creator":"Shao Z.","prism:publicationName":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, ICIP 2013 - Proceedings","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781479923410"}],"prism:pageRange":"4579-4582","prism:coverDate":"2013-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2013","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2013.6738943","dc:description":"The gyrator transform has been proposed in optics a few years ago.
