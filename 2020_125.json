Further, if the debris is axisymmetric, such as the remains of a multistage rocket, or if part of the debris cannot be seen due to optical conditions, it is considerably more difficult to estimate its parameters. If some parameters cannot be estimated for some reason, all parameters may be affected because each parameter in Euler angle and quaternion has an interdependency and the solution will not be determined uniquely. This research proposes methods that obtain the solution by decomposing the quaternion into the direction and rotation based on the forward direction so that direction and rotation parameters can be estimated independently. Moreover, this research was able to adaptively improve accuracy based on a threshold of uncertainty by adding an uncertainty value to each parameter. When the estimated parameters likely having error values that exceed 2% based on uncertainty value are deleted, estimated error of parameter x, y, z (position), n-{x}, n-{y},n-{z} and \\theta-{z} (attitude) were 1.25%, 1.35%, 3.76%, 2.27%, 2.64%, 3.06%, and 18.32% respectively.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022990","afid":"60022990","affilname":"Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency","affiliation-city":"Chofu","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204771926","authid":"57204771926","authname":"Hashimoto S.","surname":"Hashimoto","given-name":"Shintaro","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022990"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/37039387000","authid":"37039387000","authname":"Hirano D.","surname":"Hirano","given-name":"Daichi","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022990"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6506067182","authid":"6506067182","authname":"Ishihama N.","surname":"Ishihama","given-name":"Naoki","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022990"}]}],"article-number":"9172298","source-id":"75113","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089479734"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089479734?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85089479734&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85089479734&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089479734","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85089479734","eid":"2-s2.0-85089479734","dc:title":"Quaternion-based sparse tight frame for multicomponent signal recovery","dc:creator":"Zhao Q.","prism:publicationName":"Geophysics","prism:issn":"00168033","prism:eIssn":"19422156","prism:volume":"85","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"V143-V156","prism:coverDate":"2020-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 March 2020","prism:doi":"10.1190/geo2019-0541.1","dc:description":"Multicomponent noise attenuation often presents more severe processing challenges than scalar data owing to the uncorrelated random noise in each component. Meanwhile, weak signals merged in the noise are easier to degrade using the scalar processing workflows while ignoring their possible supplement from other components. For seismic data preprocessing, transform-based approaches have achieved improved performance on mitigating noise while preserving the signal of interest, especially when using an adaptive basis trained by dictionary-learning methods. We have developed a quaternion-based sparse tight frame (QSTF) with the help of quaternion matrix and tight frame analyses, which can be used to process the vector-valued multicomponent data by following a vectorial processing workflow. The QSTF is conveniently trained through iterative sparsity-based regularization and quaternion singular-value decomposition. In the quaternion-based sparse domain, multicomponent signals are orthogonally represented, which preserve the nonlinear relationships among multicomponent data to a greater extent as compared with the scalar approaches. We test the performance of our method on synthetic and field multicomponent data, in which component-wise, concatenated, and long-vector models of multicomponent data are used as comparisons. Our results indicate that more features, specifically the weak signals merged in the noise, are better recovered using our method than others.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true",

algorithm was designed based on Student's t distribution as a local filtering algorithm, by combining the Student's t filtering framework with the characteristics of quaternion and calculating the Student's t weighted integral function by unscented transformation. The optimal fusion weight coefficients were calculated by Lagrange multiplier method, and the local filtering results were fused by linear weighted fusion method. Quaternion was applied for simulation of the target attitude motion model. Three star sensors were used to observe the same target at the same time. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was verified through the comparison with the existing robust unscented Student's t filtering (RSTUF) algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed distributed information fusion algorithm based on Student 's t filtering framework has higher estimation accuracy, convergence speed and numerical stability than RSTUF algorithm, which improves the estimation accuracy and fault tolerance of the algorithm by the complementarity of multi-observation information.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100661898","afid":"100661898","affilname":"Beijing Institute of Space Long March Vehicle","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194015291","authid":"57194015291","orcid":"0000-0002-0291-9155","authname":"Wu X.H.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Xiao Hang","initials":"X.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"100661898"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24281705200","authid":"24281705200","orcid":"0000-0002-0285-8284","authname":"Ma K.M.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Ke Mao","initials":"K.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]}],"authkeywords":"Distributed fusion | Integrated navigation | Quaternion | Student's t distribution | Unscented quaternion filter","source-id":"15156","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85082495781"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85082495781?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85082495781&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85082495781&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85082495781","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85082495781","eid":"2-s2.0-85082495781","dc:title":"A precise visual localisation method for the Chinese Chang’e-4 Yutu-2 rover","dc:creator":"Ma Y.Q.","prism:publicationName":"Photogrammetric Record","prism:issn":"0031868X","prism:eIssn":"14779730","prism:volume":"35","prism:issueIdentifier":"169","prism:pageRange":"10-39","prism:coverDate":"2020-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 March 2020","prism:doi":"10.1111/phor.12309","dc:description":"Precise localisation of the Yutu-2 moon rover plays an important role in path planning, obstacle avoidance and navigating to target features.

This study combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 on an Octonion basis as well as Sentinel-2 and ALOS-PALSAR-2 on a Sedenion basis. The validation using signatures of typical land cover classes showed that the efficient archiving in 4 bit images still guaranteed an accuracy over 90% in the class assignment. Due to the stability of the resulting class signatures, the fuzziness to be caught by Machine Learning Algorithms was minimized at the same time. Thus, this methodology was predestined to act as new standard for ARD remote sensing data with an subsequent image fusion processed in so-called data cubes.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60102538","afid":"60102538","affilname":"Karlsruher Institut für Technologie","affiliation-city":"Karlsruhe","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018401","afid":"60018401","affilname":"Hochschule München","affiliation-city":"Munich","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007798","afid":"60007798","affilname":"Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR)","affiliation-city":"Koln","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55576223700","authid":"55576223700","orcid":"0000-0002-0232-2666","authname":"Schmitt A.","surname":"Schmitt","given-name":"Andreas","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018401"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36012163600","authid":"36012163600","authname":"Wendleder A.","surname":"Wendleder","given-name":"Anna","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007798"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57215896519","authid":"57215896519","authname":"Kleynmans R.","surname":"Kleynmans","given-name":"Rüdiger","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018401"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57561515600","authid":"57561515600","authname":"Hell M.","surname":"Hell","given-name":"Maximilian","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018401"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56256016700","authid":"56256016700","authname":"Roth A.","surname":"Roth","given-name":"Achim","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007798"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004082496","authid":"7004082496","authname":"Hinz S.","surname":"Hinz","given-name":"Stefan","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102538"}]}],"authkeywords":"Analysis ready data | Change detection | Data cube | Efficient archiving | Hypercomplex bases | Image fusion | Kennaugh framework | Quaternion | SAR sharpening | Time series","article-number":"943","source-id":"86430","fund-acr":"ESA","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"European Space Agency","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85081204684"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85081204684?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85081204684&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85081204684&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S001600322030096X"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85081204684","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85081204684","eid":"2-s2.0-85081204684","dc:title":"Semi-widely linear estimation algorithms of quaternion signals with missing observations and correlated noises","dc:creator":"Fernández-Alcalá R.M.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of the Franklin Institute","prism:issn":"00160032","prism:volume":"357","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"3075-3096","prism:coverDate":"2020-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"March 2020","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jfranklin.2020.02.012","pii":"S001600322030096X","dc:description":"The paper deals with the estimation problem of a discrete-time vectorial quaternion signal which is observed through a linear dynamic system with intermittent observations and autocorrelated and cross-correlated noises.

Inspired by previous studies showing that phase spectrum of quaternion Fourier transform (PQFT) great superiority in salient region extraction and the desirable characteristics of multi-scale, multi-direction and shift-invariant with non-subsampled shearlet transform (NSST), a new target detection method is proposed based on NSST and PQFT in this paper. The original image is first subjected to NSST decomposition to obtain a low frequency component and four high frequency components by NSP. Next, directional localization is achieved by shearing filters which provides multi-directional decomposition. Then, four direction high frequency sub-images decomposed by NSST are introduced as four data channels of PQFT. The reconstruction map that highlights the salient region in the time domain is computed using the inverse PQFT. Lastly, the real target is directly segmented by an adaptive threshold. The proposed method is validated by five test sequences. The experimental results show that our method is superior to other traditional methods in terms of robustness and effectiveness in complex background.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60088063","afid":"60088063","affilname":"China Electronic Technology Group Corporation","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010080","afid":"60010080","affilname":"Nanjing University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/124030973","afid":"124030973","affilname":"Hua An Industry Group Co., Ltd","affiliation-city":null,"affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55877072700","authid":"55877072700","orcid":"0000-0003-3391-5795","authname":"Ren K.","surname":"Ren","given-name":"Kan","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010080"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57215544526","authid":"57215544526","authname":"Song C.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Congcong","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010080"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57215546831","authid":"57215546831","authname":"Miao X.","surname":"Miao","given-name":"Xin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60088063"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188754227","authid":"57188754227","authname":"Wan M.","surname":"Wan","given-name":"Minjie","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010080"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57215525199","authid":"57215525199","authname":"Xiao J.","surname":"Xiao","given-name":"Junfeng","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"124030973"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7203056000","authid":"7203056000","authname":"Gu G.","surname":"Gu","given-name":"Guohua","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010080"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192659447","authid":"57192659447","authname":"Chen Q.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Qian","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010080"}]}],"authkeywords":"Infrared small target detection | NSST | PFT | Phase spectrum | PQFT","article-number":"168","source-id":"12313","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61701233","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85079839171"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85079839171?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85079839171&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85079839171&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0016003220300533"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85079839171","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85079839171","eid":"2-s2.0-85079839171","dc:title":"Novel fractional-order polar harmonic transforms for gray-scale and color image analysis","dc:creator":"Hosny K.M.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of the Franklin Institute","prism:issn":"00160032","prism:volume":"357","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"2533-2560","prism:coverDate":"2020-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"March 2020","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jfranklin.2020.01.025","pii":"S0016003220300533","dc:description":"A novel set of fractional orthogonal polar harmonic transforms for gray-scale and color image analysis are presented in this paper.

A marker model concept based on marker triplets combined with a fast and robust algorithm for assigning image feature points to the corresponding markers of the tracker is introduced. Also included is a new and fast algorithm for pose estimation. Methods: A peer-to-peer tracker consists of seven markers, which can be tracked by other peers, and one camera which is used to track the position and orientation of other peers. The special marker layout enables a fast and robust algorithm for assigning image feature points to the correct markers. The iterative pose estimation algorithm is based on point-to-line matching with Lagrange–Newton optimization and does not rely on initial guesses. Uniformly distributed quaternions in 4D (the vertices of a hexacosichora) are used as starting points and always provide the global minimum. Results: Experiments have shown that the marker assignment algorithm robustly assigns image feature points to the correct markers even under challenging conditions. The pose estimation algorithm works fast, robustly and always finds the correct pose of the trackers. Image processing, marker assignment, and pose estimation for two trackers are handled in less than 18 ms on an Intel i7-6700 desktop computer at 3.4 GHz. Conclusion: The new peer-to-peer tracking concept is a valuable approach to a decentralized navigation system that offers more freedom in the operating room while providing accurate, fast, and robust results.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005597","afid":"60005597","affilname":"University of Applied Sciences Offenburg","affiliation-city":"Offenburg","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/123701217","afid":"123701217","affilname":"Stryker Leibinger GmbH &amp; Co.

Owing to their favorable image description capability and geometric invariance, moments and moment invariants have become a popular tool for the zero-watermarking. However, two issues of the moments-based zero-watermarking methods should be addressed: First, most of them ignore the analysis and experiment on discriminability, resulting in a high false positive ratio; Second, direct computation of the moments from their definition is inefficient, numerically unstable and inaccurate, which severely affects the performances of these moments-based methods. To overcome the two challenges, in this paper, we present a Fast Quaternion Generic Polar Complex Exponential Transform (FQGPCET) based color image zero-watermarking algorithm. We first propose a novel computation strategy, i.e. FGPCET, to solve the moments computing problems. We then show that it is possible to generate a robust and discriminative image feature, by mixing the low-order QGPCET moments/coefficients. And finally, we develop a new color image zero-watermarking approach using FQGPCET and asymmetric tent map. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed zero-watermarking algorithm achieves a good trade-off between robustness and discriminability, and has certain superiority in terms of security, capacity and time complexity.","citedby-count":"49","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017010","afid":"60017010","affilname":"Liaoning Normal University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972350300","authid":"34972350300","authname":"Yang H.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Hong ying","initials":"H.y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211448544","authid":"57211448544","authname":"Qi S.","surname":"Qi","given-name":"Shu ren","initials":"S.r.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16205443400","authid":"16205443400","authname":"Niu P.","surname":"Niu","given-name":"Pan pan","initials":"P.p.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972239800","authid":"34972239800","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiang yang","initials":"X.y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]}],"authkeywords":"Discriminability | Fast computation | Generic polar complex exponential transform | Quaternion | Zero-watermarking","article-number":"115747","source-id":"13803","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"2017RQ055","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077268387"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077268387?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077268387&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077268387&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077268387","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85077268387","eid":"2-s2.0-85077268387","dc:title":"Augmented Quaternion ESPRIT-Type DOA Estimation with a Crossed-Dipole Array","dc:creator":"Chen H.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Communications Letters","prism:issn":"10897798","prism:eIssn":"15582558","prism:volume":"24","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"548-552","prism:coverDate":"2020-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"March 2020","prism:doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2019.2962463","dc:description":"In this letter, a quaternion-based ESPRIT-type algorithm called augmented quaternion ESPRIT (AQ-ESPRIT) is proposed for direction of arrival (DOA) estimation with a co-located crossed-dipole array.

In addition, in order to reduce the resource consumption and increase the calculation efficiency of the designed FPGA program, the method of avoiding floating-point arithmetic and division operation in FPGA programming are discussed in this paper. There are a large number of common calculation modules between different tasks, such as the rotation matrix calculation module in attitude solution, geometric correction, and orthorectification task. Image preprocessing, feature information extraction, image threshold separation, and connected region markers are all common processing modules for a target detection task. In the same task, there is also a common calculation module. When using the FPGA design program, the power series of 2 can be used to convert the floating-point operation to fixed-point operation with an acceptable precision.

However, during the robot dynamic attitude measurement with IMU, there exist some problems that affect the accuracy of measurement, such as the superposition of harmful accelerations (other acceleration information except gravity acceleration signal) in the accelerometer signal, the difficulty in obtaining the statistical characteristic parameters of noise and the drift of gyroscope signal with time. Aiming at these problems, an improved algorithm of adaptive extended kalman filter (EKF) for attitude measurement is designed. Based on the EKF model, this algorithm firstly constructs the first level measurement noise variance matrix, sets up weighted factors and reduces the influence of harmful acceleration signals on measurement result. Secondly, the idea of fading memory factor is introduced in Sage-Husa adaptive filter algorithm to track the measurement noise of sampling data in real time and construct the second level measurement noise variance matrix. Finally, the quaternion algorithm of attitude updating is adopted to conduct data fusion and correct the error caused by gyroscope signal drift. The experiment results show that compared with the Sage-Husa adaptive filter algorithm, the improved self-adaptive EKF algorithm can effectively improve the attitude measurement accuracy; the mean absolute errors of pitch and roll at peak height are reduced by 50% and 36.43%, respectively, and the mean absolute errors of pitch and roll at peak valley are reduced by 14.28% and 19.44%, respectively.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019533","afid":"60019533","affilname":"Tianjin University","affiliation-city":"Tianjin","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017080","afid":"60017080","affilname":"China Jiliang University","affiliation-city":"Hangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010461","afid":"60010461","affilname":"National Institute of Metrology China","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57217004743","authid":"57217004743","authname":"Ban Z.","surname":"Ban","given-name":"Zhao","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017080"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010461"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15077021500","authid":"15077021500","authname":"Ren G.","surname":"Ren","given-name":"Guoying","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010461"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019533"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221063558","authid":"57221063558","authname":"Wang B.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Binrui","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017080"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206710958","authid":"57206710958","authname":"Chen X.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Xiangjun","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019533"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude measurement | Data fusion | Exponential fading memory | Extended Kalman filter | Inertial measurement unit","source-id":"15597","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85083981881"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85083981881?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85083981881&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85083981881&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85083981881","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85083981881","eid":"2-s2.0-85083981881","dc:title":"Vision-based attitude estimation for spacecraft docking operation through deep learning algorithm","dc:creator":"Phisannupawong T.","prism:publicationName":"International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology, ICACT","prism:issn":"17389445","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9791188428045"}],"prism:volume":"2020","prism:pageRange":"280-284","prism:coverDate":"2020-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"February 2020","prism:doi":"10.23919/ICACT48636.2020.9061445","dc:description":"On-orbital services, especially in docking operation and other space object interaction. The missions need accurate, reliable, and robust detection to be an accurate in joining any interaction concerned. Two spacecrafts with an unknown mathematical model to predict the position and orientation, a computer vision-based attitude estimation system to detect the poses of spacecraft via camera is the key option of the mission. In astronautics control, the position coordinates are normally represented as the cartesian coordinate system and used a quaternions coordinate system for orientation representation because quaternions can represent the orientation of spacecraft better than physical angle and can overcome the problem of singularity. This paper aims to construct a model for both position and orientation estimation with public data. The input images are the dataset of Soyuz in the resolution of 1280x960, which is simulated by Unreal Engine 4. The implementation of this paper use GoogLeNet for a convolutional neural network model with the mathematical model of loss subject to direct regression. The result shows that a position estimation is significantly accurate with having distance error smaller than 1 meter and trand to reduce when setting a proper scaling factor for loss function. The result demonstrates a high error for orientation estimation. However, the experiment expresses that both position and orientation estimation can be improved in case of selecting a suitable scaling factor of loss function.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60274668","afid":"60274668","affilname":"National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand","affiliation-city":"Chiangmai","affiliation-country":"Thailand"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021543","afid":"60021543","affilname":"King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang","affiliation-city":"Ladkrabang Bangkok","affiliation-country":"Thailand"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216588960","authid":"57216588960","authname":"Phisannupawong T.","surname":"Phisannupawong","given-name":"Thaweerath","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021543"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57213195114","authid":"57213195114","authname":"Kamsing P.","surname":"Kamsing","given-name":"Patcharin","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021543"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35096899200","authid":"35096899200","authname":"Tortceka P.","surname":"Tortceka","given-name":"Peerapong","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60274668"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/37014031600","authid":"37014031600","authname":"Yooyen S.","surname":"Yooyen","given-name":"Soemsak","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021543"}]}],"authkeywords":"Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) | Deep Learning | On Orbit Services | Pose Estimation | Spacecraft Docking","article-number":"9061445","source-id":"6400153139","fund-acr":"KMITL","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85078663239"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85078663239?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85078663239&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85078663239&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85078663239","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85078663239","eid":"2-s2.0-85078663239","dc:title":"Quaternion Windowed Linear Canonical Transform of Two-Dimensional Signals","dc:creator":"Gao W.","prism:publicationName":"Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras","prism:issn":"01887009","prism:eIssn":"16614909","prism:volume":"30","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 February 2020","prism:doi":"10.1007/s00006-020-1042-4","dc:description":"We investigate the 2D quaternion windowed linear canonical transform (QWLCT) in this paper.

The cexp function is shown to be scator holomorphic in the entire scator set according to the differential quotient criterion. The scator derivative of the cexp function is the cexp function itself. The relationship between the Cartesian and polar forms of the cexp function can be seen as a higher-dimensional extension of Euler formula.

Therefore, non-aligned double JPEG compression detection has attracted significant attention in digital forensics in recent years. In most of the previous detection algorithms, grayscale images are used directly, or color images are first converted into grayscale images and then processed. However, it is worth noting that most tampered images are color images. To make full use of the color information in images, a detection algorithm, which uses color images directly, is put forward in this paper. The algorithm based on refined Markov in quaternion discrete cosine transform (QDCT) domain is proposed for NA-DJPEG compression detection. Firstly, color information of a given JPEG image is extracted from blocked images to construct quaternion, and then block image QDCT coefficient matrices, including amplitude and three angles (ψ, ϕ, and θ) can be obtained. Secondly, the refined Markov features are generated from the transition probability matrix in the corresponding refinement process. Our proposed refinement method not only reduces redundant features but also makes the acquired features more efficient in detection. Therefore, the refined Markov features can not only capture the intra-block correlation between block QDCT coefficients but also improve computing efficiency in real-time. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) method is employed for NA-DJPEG compression detection. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only make use of color information of images, but also can achieve better detection performance with small size images (i.e., 64 × 64) outperforming state-of-the-art detection methods tested on the same dataset.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143","afid":"60064143","affilname":"Nanjing University of Information Science &amp; Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025578","afid":"60025578","affilname":"Xidian University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022904","afid":"60022904","affilname":"New Jersey Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Newark","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113421545","afid":"113421545","affilname":"State Key Laboratory of Mathematical Engineering and Advanced Computing","affiliation-city":"Zhengzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219116697","authid":"57219116697","authname":"Wang J.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Jinwei","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113421545"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211362450","authid":"57211362450","authname":"Huang W.","surname":"Huang","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8976166200","authid":"8976166200","authname":"Luo X.","surname":"Luo","given-name":"Xiangyang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113421545"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404964736","authid":"7404964736","authname":"Shi Y.Q.","surname":"Shi","given-name":"Yun Qing","initials":"Y.Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022904"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221974224","authid":"57221974224","authname":"Jha S.K.","surname":"Jha","given-name":"Sunil Kr","initials":"S.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image forensics | Non-aligned double JPEG compression detection | Quaternion discrete cosine transform Markov model | Real-time image feature selection","source-id":"4900152415","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"2016QY01W0105","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85074952389"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85074952389?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85074952389&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85074952389&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0094576519313487"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85074952389","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85074952389","eid":"2-s2.0-85074952389","dc:title":"Quaternion-based adaptive attitude control of asteroid-orbiting spacecraft via immersion and invariance","dc:creator":"Lee K.W.","prism:publicationName":"Acta Astronautica","prism:issn":"00945765","prism:volume":"167","prism:pageRange":"164-180","prism:coverDate":"2020-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"February 2020","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.actaastro.2019.10.031","pii":"S0094576519313487","dc:description":"The design of an attitude control system for an asteroid-orbiting satellite via immersion and invariance is the subject of this paper. It is assumed that the asteroid is rotating with a constant rate, and that the inertia parameters of the satellite and the coefficients in the spherical harmonic gravitational potential of the asteroid are not known. The objective is to regulate the quaternion trajectory of the satellite orbiting in an equatorial orbit. Based on the immersion and invariance (I&I) theory, a noncertainty-equivalence adaptive (NCEA) attitude control law is derived. For the design, a backstepping design process involving two steps is used, and filtered signals are constructed to overcome the difficulty in solving certain matrix inequalities of the I&I methodology. The control law includes a stabilizer and an identifier - designed separately. Unlike the classical certainty-equivalence adaptive (CEA) systems, here the estimated parameters include not only the signals obtained from an integral type update law, but also judiciously chosen nonlinear algebraic signals that yield stronger stability properties. By the Lyapunov stability analysis, it is shown that the quaternion trajectories of the disturbance input-free closed-loop system asymptotically converge to the equilibrium point. The control law is effective in regulating the attitude to the equilibrium point with minimal rotation of spacecraft. Also, for the model with disturbance input, uniform ultimate boundedness of system trajectories is established. Simulation results for the attitude control of spacecraft in orbit around asteroid 433 Eros are presented for illustration. These results show that the spacecraft achieves nadir pointing attitude despite uncertainties in the system dynamics.","citedby-count":"17","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031892","afid":"60031892","affilname":"University of Nevada, Las Vegas","affiliation-city":"Las Vegas","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024495","afid":"60024495","affilname":"Catholic Kwandong University","affiliation-city":"Gangneung","affiliation-country":"South Korea"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15842032500","authid":"15842032500","authname":"Lee K.W.","surname":"Lee","given-name":"Keum W.","initials":"K.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024495"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55939297200","authid":"55939297200","authname":"Singh S.N.","surname":"Singh","given-name":"Sahjendra N.","initials":"S.N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031892"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive attitude control | Adaptive quaternion trajectory regulation | Asteroid-orbiting spacecraft | Backstepping design | Immersion and invariance-based design | Lyapunov stability | Noncertainty-equivalence adaptive control | Parameter identifier","source-id":"12372","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073953397"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073953397?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073953397&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073953397&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073953397","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85073953397","eid":"2-s2.0-85073953397","dc:title":"Online mobile C-arm calibration using inertial sensors: a preliminary study in order to achieve CBCT","dc:creator":"Lemammer I.","prism:publicationName":"International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery","prism:issn":"18616410","prism:eIssn":"18616429","prism:volume":"15","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"213-224","prism:coverDate":"2020-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 February 2020","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11548-019-02061-6","dc:description":"Purpose: Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) became increasingly popular over the last years. It allows more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning with a lower effective radiation dose. However, volume reconstruction algorithms require a very precise knowledge of the imaging geometry. Due to mechanical instabilities, mobile C-arms are incompatible with existing tomography algorithms. Therefore, C-arm online calibration is essential in order to achieve an accurate volume reconstruction. Methods: We present an online calibration method for mobile C-arms. It is based on tracking the detector and the X-ray source of the C-arm using three-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers. It aims to be precise and noninvasive. The performance of the calibration algorithm is evaluated in regard to the precision of the sensors and to whether or not dynamic models are considered. In addition, we present an algorithm which propagate the errors from the positions and orientations estimates to the 2D projections on the detector plane. Thus, we can evaluate the impact of the estimation errors on the acquired images. Results: The experiments are conducted on an experimental C-arm. The reached accuracy is ≈ 0. 19 ∘ for orientation and ≈3.0mm for position. These errors propagate as an error of ≈2mm for the 2D projections on the detector plane. Conclusions: The proposed calibration algorithm achieves an accuracy comparable to the precision of existing calibration methods. The required angle accuracy by CBCT algorithms is reached. However, improvements are needed to achieve the required position precision. The in-plane translations of the X-ray source and the detector are the most crucial parameters to estimate in order to conduct CBCT on mobile C-arms.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104653","afid":"60104653","affilname":"Université Grenoble Alpes","affiliation-city":"Saint Martin d'Heres","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/122733487","afid":"122733487","affilname":"Thales AVS France","affiliation-city":"Moirans","affiliation-country":"France"}],"pubmed-id":"31506881","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211444161","authid":"57211444161","orcid":"0000-0002-7627-2710","authname":"Lemammer I.","surname":"Lemammer","given-name":"Imane","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104653"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"122733487"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55508156500","authid":"55508156500","authname":"Michel O.","surname":"Michel","given-name":"Olivier","initials":"O.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104653"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25824678700","authid":"25824678700","authname":"Ayasso H.","surname":"Ayasso","given-name":"Hacheme","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104653"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603517425","authid":"6603517425","authname":"Zozor S.","surname":"Zozor","given-name":"Steeve","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104653"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193424563","authid":"57193424563","authname":"Bernard G.","surname":"Bernard","given-name":"Guillaume","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"122733487"}]}],"authkeywords":"CBCT | Error propagation | IMU | Mobile C-arm | Online calibration | Pose estimation","source-id":"4700152490","fund-acr":"ANRT","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073504740"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073504740?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073504740&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073504740&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0923596519303856"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073504740","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85073504740","eid":"2-s2.0-85073504740","dc:title":"Multiple-image encryption based on chaotic phase mask and equal modulus decomposition in quaternion gyrator domain","dc:creator":"Shao Z.","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing: Image Communication","prism:issn":"09235965","prism:volume":"80","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"February 2020","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.image.2019.115662","pii":"S0923596519303856","dc:description":"In order to transmit multiple-image synchronously, this paper introduces an encryption algorithm by combining equal modulus decomposition with quaternion gyrator transform.

It is subsequently split into a complex-valued interim matrix and the equal modulus decomposition is performed to enhance the security, where the spectrum is divided into two complex-valued masks.

The two-dimensional image of the leader spacecraft with multiple geometric features is obtained by the camera. Multiple geometric features including points, lines and circles are described under dual number algebra, and the observation models are proposed based on the geometric projection relationships of these features. By the proposed method, the geometric features appeared on the leader spacecraft can be employed to estimate the relative state between the two spacecraft. Another contribution of this paper is to develop a six-degree-of-freedom relative motion dynamics using dual number. The dynamics model describes the relative motion between arbitrary points on the spacecraft, and both the kinematically and dynamically coupling effects are considered. Based on the derived process model and observation model, an extended Kalman filter is presented to estimate the relative state between the two spacecraft. In addition, an unscented Kalman filter is also developed to avoid complicated calculation of derivations. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to evaluate the proposed EKF and UKF approaches based on multiple geometric feature measurement. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and show that by using EKF or UKF technique, the relative translation and rotation estimation errors converge rapidly with the desired high estimation accuracy. Comparison simulations are made with the situations using less feature measurement, which demonstrate that employing multiple feature measurement provides superior estimation performance than methods with less feature measurement.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021182","afid":"60021182","affilname":"Sun Yat-Sen University","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114662483","afid":"114662483","affilname":"Beijing Institute of Space Long March Vehicle","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/112974616","afid":"112974616","affilname":"Science and Technology on Space Physics Laboratory","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35604063300","authid":"35604063300","authname":"Liang H.","surname":"Liang","given-name":"Haizhao","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021182"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55949634900","authid":"55949634900","orcid":"0000-0001-7428-8076","authname":"Wang J.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Jianying","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021182"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204432713","authid":"57204432713","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yonghai","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"114662483"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57210325338","authid":"57210325338","authname":"Huo W.","surname":"Huo","given-name":"Wenxia","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"112974616"}]}],"authkeywords":"coupled dynamics | Dual quaternion | Kalman filtering | monocular vision | relative state estimation","source-id":"29080","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
