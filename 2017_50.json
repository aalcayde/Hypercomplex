We use a coordinate independent approach for the purpose of designing the control and estimation laws in terms of the rotation matrices representing the spacecraft body frame and reference tracking signals. This method helps to overcome the difficulties regarding the attitude representation on SO(3) such as ambiguities associated with quaternion representation and inherent singularities inside Euler parameters. We model the time variations in inertial parameters in two different ways, and design adaptive control schemes for each case. As the first uncertain dynamic model, we consider a setting of spacecraft with multiple moving appendages, and based on this model, design an adaptive control scheme with three different versions, where Frobenious norm is used in measuring the deviation of the estimated inertia tensors from their actual values. The proposed adaptive control scheme is later extended for the more direct model where the inertia tensor of the spacecraft has a nonlinear relation with the norm of the input moment. Further, we derive the allowable sets of initial conditions to ensure the convergence of the tracking error. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014171","afid":"60014171","affilname":"University of Waterloo","affiliation-city":"Waterloo","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55904071100","authid":"55904071100","authname":"Fadakar I.","surname":"Fadakar","given-name":"Iman","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014171"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56592383100","authid":"56592383100","authname":"Fidan B.","surname":"Fidan","given-name":"Baris","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014171"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603890963","authid":"6603890963","authname":"Huissoon J.","surname":"Huissoon","given-name":"Jan P.","initials":"J.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014171"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive control | attitude control | time-varying uncertainties","source-id":"12342","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85037105947"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85037105947?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85037105947&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85037105947&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85037105947","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85037105947","eid":"2-s2.0-85037105947","dc:title":"A fast method of extracting the laser light bar's centerline in the ice model","dc:creator":"Kang H.","prism:publicationName":"Shiyan Liuti Lixue/Journal of Experiments in Fluid Mechanics","prism:issn":"16729897","prism:volume":"31","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"81-87","prism:coverDate":"2017-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2017","prism:doi":"10.11729/syltlx20170058","dc:description":"The laser centerline extraction is an important step in the measurement of the ice cross sectional profile, and the extraction accuracy directly affects the accuracy of the measurement system.

First, the image is subjected to noise reduction based on the technique of Block-matching and 3D filtering. Second, in order to reduce the computational complexity, the visual significance of the image is calculated by using the quaternion Fourier transform of phase spectrum, and then extract the optical band's region.

The coordinate transformation of the matching feature points was solved based on the unit quaternion. Then the data coarse registration was completed. The method and procedure for determining the modified coefficient were discussed, and mean error of different correction factors was calculated in order to get the best modified coefficient. The different perspectives of clouds were optimally matched in three-dimensional space by using fine matching technology based on adaptive distance function and the improved iterative closest surface.

Effective performance of an autonomous task requires accurate hand–eye calibration so that the transformation between the robot coordinate frame and the camera coordinates is well defined. In practice, due to changes in surgical instruments, online hand–eye calibration must be performed regularly. In order to ensure seamless execution of the surgical procedure without affecting the normal surgical workflow, it is important to derive fast and efficient hand–eye calibration methods. Methods: We present a computationally efficient iterative method for hand–eye calibration. In this method, dual quaternion is introduced to represent the rigid transformation, and a two-step iterative method is proposed to recover the real and dual parts of the dual quaternion simultaneously, and thus the estimation of rotation and translation of the transformation. Results: The proposed method was applied to determine the rigid transformation between the stereo laparoscope and the robot manipulator. Promising experimental and simulation results have shown significant convergence speed improvement to 3 iterations from larger than 30 with regard to standard optimization method, which illustrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.","citedby-count":"34","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015150","afid":"60015150","affilname":"Imperial College London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012070","afid":"60012070","affilname":"University of Leeds","affiliation-city":"Leeds","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"pubmed-id":"28726116","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56879548200","authid":"56879548200","orcid":"0000-0003-0204-3867","authname":"Zhang Z.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Zhiqiang","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012070"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56423007000","authid":"56423007000","authname":"Zhang L.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Lin","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55539304100","authid":"55539304100","authname":"Yang G.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Guang Zhong","initials":"G.Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]}],"authkeywords":"Hand–eye calibration | Minimally invasive surgery | Optimization | Robot–camera calibration","source-id":"4700152490","fund-acr":"EPSRC","fund-no":"EP/H009744/1","fund-sponsor":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherhybridgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Hybrid Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85021769715"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85021769715?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85021769715&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85021769715&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0167865517302258"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85021769715","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85021769715","eid":"2-s2.0-85021769715","dc:title":"Highly accurate and numerically stable higher order QPCET moments for color image representation","dc:creator":"Hosny K.M.","prism:publicationName":"Pattern Recognition Letters","prism:issn":"01678655","prism:volume":"97","prism:pageRange":"29-36","prism:coverDate":"2017-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2017","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.patrec.2017.06.019","pii":"S0167865517302258","dc:description":"A novel method is proposed for highly accurate, fast and numerically stable computation of the higher order Quaternion Polar Complex Exponential Transform (QPCET) moments for color images in polar Coordinates.

Most existing methods are developed to remove only single-point impulse noise and usually perform poor when applied to blob noise removal. This paper presents a new method to suppress such complex blob noise with varying sizes and irregular shapes in color images. First, a noisy image is segmented into super pixels by mean shift filtering followed by a clustering operation based on quaternion color distance. Then, by analyzing the characteristics of super pixels, image pixels are classified into noise-free, blob-noisy, and single-point impulse ones. Finally, a selected recursive vector median filter with adaptive window sizes is employed on the noisy pixels detected. The experimental results exhibit the validity of the proposed solution by showing excellent denoising effect and performance, compared to other color image denoising methods.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025761","afid":"60025761","affilname":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15922652500","authid":"15922652500","authname":"Jin L.","surname":"Jin","given-name":"Lianghai","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]}],"authkeywords":"Blob noise | Color image | Quaternion | Super pixel segmentation","source-id":"25592","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61370179","fund-sponsor":"University of Dundee","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85019587528"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85019587528?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85019587528&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85019587528&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85019587528","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85019587528","eid":"2-s2.0-85019587528","dc:title":"GNSS attitude determination with non-synchronized receivers and short baselines onboard a spacecraft","dc:creator":"Willi D.","prism:publicationName":"GPS Solutions","prism:issn":"10805370","prism:eIssn":"15211886","prism:volume":"21","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"1605-1617","prism:coverDate":"2017-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2017","prism:doi":"10.1007/s10291-017-0639-0","dc:description":"A new algorithm for global navigation satellite system attitude determination onboard a spacecraft was developed. A distinct feature of the algorithm is the extrapolation of the measurements to a common epoch within a Kalman filter. The necessity for the extrapolation arises from the usage of non-synchronized low-cost receivers. The extrapolation terms typically range from - 6 to +6 m for u-blox receivers. Thus, no solution can be obtained without a proper extrapolation. A validation was carried out with synthetic data as well as with signal simulator data. The algorithm delivers an attitude estimation with an accuracy below 1° for three orthogonal baselines of 10 cm length. In conclusion, the algorithm is proven to work, offering a very efficient method of attitude determination onboard a spacecraft.","citedby-count":"18","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025858","afid":"60025858","affilname":"ETH Zürich","affiliation-city":"Zurich ZH,","affiliation-country":"Switzerland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56418503000","authid":"56418503000","orcid":"0000-0002-6580-6801","authname":"Willi D.","surname":"Willi","given-name":"Daniel","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025858"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602852813","authid":"6602852813","authname":"Rothacher M.","surname":"Rothacher","given-name":"Markus","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025858"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude determination | Kalman filter | Low earth orbit | Quaternion | Satellite | Spacecraft","source-id":"144827","fund-acr":"ETH","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964022199"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964022199?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84964022199&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84964022199&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964022199","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84964022199","eid":"2-s2.0-84964022199","dc:title":"Envelope detection using generalized analytic signal in 2D QLCT domains","dc:creator":"Kou K.","prism:publicationName":"Multidimensional Systems and Signal Processing","prism:issn":"09236082","prism:eIssn":"15730824","prism:volume":"28","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"1343-1366","prism:coverDate":"2017-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2017","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11045-016-0410-7","dc:description":"The hypercomplex 2D analytic signal has been proposed by several authors with applications in color image processing. The analytic signal enables to extract local features from images. It has the fundamental property of splitting the identity, meaning that it separates qualitative and quantitative information of an image in form of the local phase and the local amplitude. The extension of analytic signal of linear canonical transform domain from 1D to 2D, covering also intrinsic 2D structures, has been proposed. We use this improved concept on envelope detector. The quaternion Fourier transform plays a vital role in the representation of multidimensional signals. The quaternion linear canonical transform (QLCT) is a well-known generalization of the quaternion Fourier transform. Some valuable properties of the two-sided QLCT are studied. Different approaches to the 2D quaternion Hilbert transforms are proposed that allow the calculation of the associated analytic signals, which can suppress the negative frequency components in the QLCT domains. As an application, examples of envelope detection demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","citedby-count":"15","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030473","afid":"60030473","affilname":"Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México","affiliation-city":"Mexico City","affiliation-country":"Mexico"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005816","afid":"60005816","affilname":"South China Normal University","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003837546","authid":"7003837546","authname":"Kou K.","surname":"Kou","given-name":"Kit Ian","initials":"K.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005816"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55743438800","authid":"55743438800","authname":"Liu M.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Ming Sheng","initials":"M.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005816"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/19639247200","authid":"19639247200","authname":"Morais J.","surname":"Morais","given-name":"João Pedro","initials":"J.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030473"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188872929","authid":"57188872929","authname":"Zou C.","surname":"Zou","given-name":"Cuiming","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]}],"authkeywords":"Analytic signal | Hilbert transform | Instantaneous amplitude | Quaternion Fourier transform | Quaternion linear canonical transform","source-id":"12409","fund-acr":"UM","fund-no":"FDCT/099/2012/A3","fund-sponsor":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85032668885"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85032668885?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85032668885&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85032668885&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85032668885","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85032668885","eid":"2-s2.0-85032668885","dc:title":"Study of wind profile prediction with a combination of signal processing and computational fluid dynamics","dc:creator":"Jiang M.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","prism:issn":"02714310","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781467368520"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2017-09-25","prism:coverDisplayDate":"25 September 2017","prism:doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2017.8050595","dc:description":"Wind profile prediction at different scales plays a crucial role for efficient operation of wind turbines and wind power prediction.

The used method is a quaternion-based approach applied to images acquired by CT-like devices. The concept of orientation recognition comes from the well-known Ballard method of arbitrary shapes detection in two-dimensional images, now commonly known as the generalized Hough transform. Aside from quaternions, used as the main mathematical tool, the orientation recognition is based on determination of an accumulator array for Euler angles.

This paper takes bottle-shape like cylinders as a target and proposes a set of new moment-based features of cylinders for global convergence in VS application. Building on convergence to the desired location, we plan a straight path from the current camera frame to the desired one and formulate camera rotation into quadratic polynomials of quaternion representation with some variables. A nonlinear minimization method is proposed to reassign these variables for meeting field of view (FOV) limits of these cylinders. In order to follow well this planned straight line, we propose an image-based tracking scheme. This paper belongs to a series of work aiming at robust VS based on image moments of some primitives. Simulation with two parallel cylinders and two crossed cylinders show the advantage of the proposed features and validate our proposed algorithm for both planning and tracking.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025756","afid":"60025756","affilname":"Hunan Agricultural University","affiliation-city":"Changsha","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014070","afid":"60014070","affilname":"Hunan Normal University","affiliation-city":"Changsha","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006541","afid":"60006541","affilname":"The University of Hong Kong","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24832044500","authid":"24832044500","authname":"Shen T.","surname":"Shen","given-name":"Tiantian","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014070"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15039818000","authid":"15039818000","authname":"Yang J.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Jiahong","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014070"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55285675300","authid":"55285675300","authname":"Cai Y.","surname":"Cai","given-name":"Yaoyi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014070"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57196194916","authid":"57196194916","authname":"Li D.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Di","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025756"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006328614","authid":"7006328614","authname":"Chesi G.","surname":"Chesi","given-name":"Graziano","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006541"}]}],"authkeywords":"Cylinders | Image Moments | Path Planning | Visual Servoing","article-number":"8029142","source-id":"21100228702","fund-acr":"HSTD","fund-no":"17B161","fund-sponsor":"Scientific Research Foundation of Hunan Provincial Education Department","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063938332"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063938332?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85063938332&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85063938332&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063938332","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85063938332","eid":"2-s2.0-85063938332","dc:title":"Image fragile watermarking through quaternion linear transform in secret space","dc:creator":"Botta M.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Imaging","prism:eIssn":"2313433X","prism:volume":"3","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2017-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"September 2017","prism:doi":"10.3390/jimaging3030034","dc:description":"In this paper, we apply the quaternion framework for color images to a fragile watermarking algorithm with the objective of multimedia integrity protection (Quaternion Karhunen-Loève Transform FragileWatermarking (QKLT-FW)).

The algorithm, based on the Quaternion Karhunen-Loève Transform (QKLT), embeds a binary watermark into some QKLT coefficients representing a host image in a secret frequency space: the QKLT basis images are computed from a secret color image used as a symmetric key. A computational intelligence technique (i.e., genetic algorithm) is employed to modify the host image pixels in such a way that the watermark is contained in the protected image.

Firstly a scale-adaptive top-hat algorithm was used to suppress the interference of clouds and oil. Then, the double-quaternion images are constructed by using double-color spatial features and edge features to detect the saliency of ships. This method makes full use of the double quaternion images, so it can be operated at the same time in a number of channels, and can save operation time to guarantee the characteristics of different scale characteristics. Furthermore, the method also uses the character that the human eye focused on the different targets for image with different sized in implement of the up-down sampling to avoid the leak overlapping in image detection. When the last saliency map is obtained, the ships were segmented to ensure the target location by using the OTSU algorithm, and then the ship target was marked and extracted in the original image. The experiments were analyzed in the several sea conditions. Experimental results show that the algorithm eliminates the interference of cloud, fog and oil pollution and ship targets are detected accurately. With this algorithm, true rate iss 97.73%, and the false alarm rate as low as 3.37%. Compared to other frequency domain saliency detection algorithms in ship detection, this algorithm has obvious advantages.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027363","afid":"60027363","affilname":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004828","afid":"60004828","affilname":"Changchun Institute of Optics Fine Mechanics and Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190837671","authid":"57190837671","authname":"Ding P.","surname":"Ding","given-name":"Peng","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57214252416","authid":"57214252416","authname":"Zhang Y.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Ye","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/22953433000","authid":"22953433000","authname":"Jia P.","surname":"Jia","given-name":"Ping","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57196419611","authid":"57196419611","authname":"Chang X.L.","surname":"Chang","given-name":"Xu Ling","initials":"X.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"}]}],"authkeywords":"Double quaternion | Multi-scale morphology | Ship detection | Target detection | Visual saliency on frequency domain","source-id":"144897","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85031750540"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85031750540?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85031750540&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85031750540&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85031750540","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85031750540","eid":"2-s2.0-85031750540","dc:title":"RGB-D Visual Saliency Detection Method Based on Spatial-Spectral Mixture Analysis","dc:creator":"Yue J.","prism:publicationName":"Jiqiren/Robot","prism:issn":"10020446","prism:volume":"39","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"652-660","prism:coverDate":"2017-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 September 2017","prism:doi":"10.13973/j.cnki.robot.2017.0652","dc:description":"To deal with the real 3D scene data faced by the mobile robot, a visual saliency detection method based on spatial-spectral mixture analysis is proposed.

However, it should be noted that the QBP is a first-order quaternion gradient descent algorithm. The convergence speed of the QBP is usually slow and may not be very suitable to process nonstationary quaternion-valued signals. To address this problem, a widely linear quaternion unscented Kalman filter (WLQUKF) algorithm is proposed to train the QFNN. This is derived by utilizing some recent studies in the augmented quaternion statistics and the HR-calculus. With the augmented quaternion statistics, the WLQUKF is able to process general quaternion-valued noncircular, nonlinear, and nonstationary signals, effectively. Simulations on both benchmark circular and noncircular quaternion-valued signals, and on real-world quaternion-valued signals support the analysis.","citedby-count":"19","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195694837","authid":"57195694837","authname":"Li X.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Xiaodong","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189631950","authid":"57189631950","authname":"Liu A.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Aijun","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404978169","authid":"7404978169","authname":"Yu C.","surname":"Yu","given-name":"Changjun","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102864861","authid":"7102864861","authname":"Su F.","surname":"Su","given-name":"Fulin","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]}],"authkeywords":"Augmented quaternion statistics | HR-calculus | noncircular | quaternion-valued feedforward neural network (QFNN) | widely linear quaternion unscented Kalman filter (WLQUKF)","article-number":"7999171","source-id":"17316","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"201505002","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028756781"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028756781?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85028756781&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85028756781&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028756781","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85028756781","eid":"2-s2.0-85028756781","dc:title":"Multi-Scale Difference Map Fusion for Tamper Localization Using Binary Ranking Hashing","dc:creator":"Yan C.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","prism:issn":"15566013","prism:volume":"12","prism:issueIdentifier":"9","prism:pageRange":"2144-2158","prism:coverDate":"2017-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"September 2017","prism:doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2017.2699942","dc:description":"The block-based analysis for tamper localization is a prevailing mechanism in hash-based forgery detection algorithm. One of the main problems with a block-based analysis is its rough localization stemming from the demand to use relatively large blocks to reduce hash length. While decreasing the block size can improve the localization resolution, the hash length tends to become too long to be practical. In this paper, we propose a binary ranking hashing approach that satisfies both the requirements of compact hash length and small block size, to obtain a binary map combined with spatial information. Meanwhile, we investigate a multiscale difference map fusion approach that fuses multiple candidate difference maps, resulting from the analysis of the subtraction between two binary maps with different sliding windows, to obtain a single, more reliable tampering map with better localization resolution. We use manifold ranking to model this multiscale difference map fusion problem and propose a two-stage scheme, namely, ranking with tampering queries and nontampering queries. Our results indicate that the proposed tamper detection method can improve the tamper localization resolution compared with state-of-the-art methods.","citedby-count":"27","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56970244300","authid":"56970244300","authname":"Yan C.","surname":"Yan","given-name":"Cai Ping","initials":"C.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003931852","authid":"7003931852","orcid":"0000-0003-1788-3746","authname":"Pun C.","surname":"Pun","given-name":"Chi Man","initials":"C.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]}],"authkeywords":"Image hashing | manifold ranking | multi-scale fusion | quaternion Fourier transform | quaternion Fourier-Mellin moments | tamper detection","article-number":"7915787","source-id":"4000149002","fund-acr":"UM","fund-no":"093-2014-A2","fund-sponsor":"Universidade de Macau","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85021811733"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85021811733?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85021811733&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85021811733&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85021811733","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85021811733","eid":"2-s2.0-85021811733","dc:title":"Design and Experiments of Ultrasound Image-Guided Multi-DOF Robot System for Brachytherapy","dc:creator":"Jiang S.","prism:publicationName":"Transactions of Tianjin University","prism:issn":"10064982","prism:eIssn":"19958196","prism:volume":"23","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"479-487","prism:coverDate":"2017-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 September 2017","prism:doi":"10.1007/s12209-017-0067-9","dc:description":"To implant radioactive seeds through a needle precisely and safely, a novel multi-DOF surgical robotic system is presented in this paper for percutaneous prostate intervention through the patient’s perineum under real-time ultrasound image guidance.

In the case of quaternion random variables, some extensions have been proposed, leading to applications in quaternion signal processing (detection, filtering, estimation). Just like in the complex case, circularity for a quaternion-valued random variable is related to the symmetries of its probability density function. As a consequence, properness of quaternion random variables should be defined with respect to the most general isometries in 4D, i.e. rotations from SO(4). Based on this idea, we propose a new definition of properness, namely the (μ1, μ2)-properness, for quaternion random variables using invariance property under the action of the rotation group SO(4). This new definition generalizes previously introduced properness concepts for quaternion random variables. A second order study is conducted and symmetry properties of the covariance matrix of (μ1, μ2)-proper quaternion random variables are presented. Comparisons with previous definitions are given and simulations illustrate in a geometric manner the newly introduced concept.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104170","afid":"60104170","affilname":"Grenoble Images Parole Signal Automatique","affiliation-city":"Saint Martin d'Heres","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6507015909","authid":"6507015909","authname":"Le Bihan N.","surname":"Le Bihan","given-name":"Nicolas","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104170"}]}],"authkeywords":"4D rotation group | Properness | Quaternion random variables | Second order moments | Structured covariance matrix | Symmetries","source-id":"25548","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028323117"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028323117?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85028323117&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85028323117&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028323117","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85028323117","eid":"2-s2.0-85028323117","dc:title":"An extended Kalman filter-based attitude tracking algorithm for star sensors","dc:creator":"Li J.","prism:publicationName":"Sensors (Switzerland)","prism:issn":"14248220","prism:volume":"17","prism:issueIdentifier":"8","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2017-08-21","prism:coverDisplayDate":"21 August 2017","prism:doi":"10.3390/s17081921","dc:description":"Efficiency and reliability are key issues when a star sensor operates in tracking mode.

Especially for face recognition, multi-spectral imaging has gained a lot of attention due to it's invariant property against variation caused by unknown illumination. However, obtaining best performance using multi-spectral imaging is still a challenge due to presence of a modality gap between the spectral imaging data and redundant band information. In this paper, we propose a fused band representation with a set of selected bands represented in Quaternion space for spectral band images to efficiently maintain the inter band relationship in spatial domain. The selection is based on measuring the information content in bands using entropy and fusion is carried out in Quaternion space for three best bands. The features from newly obtained image is collaboratively represented to achieve robust performance. The proposed approach is experimentally validated on the extended multi-spectral face database of 168 subjects, whose spectral band images are captured in 9 narrow spectral bands in visible and near infrared range (530nm to 1000nm). The quantitative performance analysis, obtained using the proposed method indicates 96.13% recognition rate at Rank-1, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019020","afid":"60019020","affilname":"Goa University","affiliation-city":"Taleigao","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013141","afid":"60013141","affilname":"Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet","affiliation-city":"Trondheim","affiliation-country":"Norway"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55320691600","authid":"55320691600","authname":"Vetrekar N.","surname":"Vetrekar","given-name":"Narayan","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019020"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013141"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188866050","authid":"57188866050","authname":"Raja K.B.","surname":"Raja","given-name":"Kiran B.","initials":"K.B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013141"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57218667948","authid":"57218667948","authname":"Raghavendra R.","surname":"Raghavendra","given-name":"R.","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013141"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8352747100","authid":"8352747100","authname":"Gad R.S.","surname":"Gad","given-name":"R.
