The singular values of a quaternion matrix are still real and positive, but the two unitary matrices are quaternion matrices with quaternion entries. Then, applications for color image processing by the SVD of a quaternion matrix are given. Since a quaternion matrix can represent a color image, so we can use the SVD of a quaternion matrix to decompose a color image. Therefore, many useful image processing methods by SVD, such as eigen-images, image compression, image enhancement and denoise, can be extended to color image processing without separating the color image into three channel images.","citedby-count":"63","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005429","afid":"60005429","affilname":"National Taiwan University","affiliation-city":"Taipei","affiliation-country":"Taiwan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202463605","authid":"7202463605","authname":"Pei S.C.","surname":"Pei","given-name":"Soo Chang","initials":"S.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005429"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7601548976","authid":"7601548976","authname":"Chang J.H.","surname":"Chang","given-name":"Ja Han","initials":"J.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005429"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402608100","authid":"7402608100","authname":"Ding J.J.","surname":"Ding","given-name":"Jian Jiun","initials":"J.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005429"}]}],"source-id":"92868","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0344666580"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0344666580?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0344666580&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0344666580&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0344666580","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0344666580","eid":"2-s2.0-0344666580","dc:title":"Quaternion principal component analysis of color images","dc:creator":"Le Bihan N.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","prism:volume":"1","prism:pageRange":"809-812","prism:coverDate":"2003-12-16","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2003","dc:description":"In this paper, we present quaternion matrix algebra techniques that can be used to process the eigen analysis of a color image. Applications of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in image processing are numerous, and the proposed tools aim to give material for color image processing, that take into account their particular nature. For this purpose, we use the quaternion model for color images and introduce the extension of two classical techniques to their quaternionic case: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Karhunen-Lòeve Transform (KLT). For the quaternionic version of the KLT, we also introduce the problem of EigenValue Decomposition (EVD) of a quaternion matrix. We give the properties of these quaternion tools for color images and present their behavior on natural images. We also present a method to compute the decompositions using complex matrix algebra. Finally, we start a discussion on possible applications of the proposed techniques in color images processing.","citedby-count":"139","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027384","afid":"60027384","affilname":"INP Grenoble - ENSIEG","affiliation-city":"Saint Martin d'Heres","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001359","afid":"60001359","affilname":"University of Essex","affiliation-city":"Colchester","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6507015909","authid":"6507015909","authname":"Le Bihan N.","surname":"Le Bihan","given-name":"Nicolas","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027384"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003346836","authid":"7003346836","authname":"Sangwine S.J.","surname":"Sangwine","given-name":"Stephen J.","initials":"S.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001359"}]}],"source-id":"92868","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0344896700"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0344896700?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0344896700&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0344896700&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0344896700","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0344896700","eid":"2-s2.0-0344896700","dc:title":"Visual position tracking using dual quaternions with hand-eye motion constraints","dc:creator":"Olsson T.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","prism:issn":"10504729","prism:volume":"3","prism:pageRange":"3491-3496","prism:coverDate":"2003-12-09","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2003","dc:description":"In this paper a method for contour-based rigid body tracking with simultaneous camera calibration is developed. The method works for a single eye-in-hand camera with unknown hand-eye transformation, viewing a stationary object with unknown position. The method uses dual quaternions to express the relationship between the camera- and end-effector screws. It is shown how using the measured motion of the robot end-effector can improve the accuracy of the estimation, even if the relative position and orientation between sensor and actuator is completely unknown. The method is evaluated in simulations on images from a real-time 3D rendering system. The system is shown to be able to track the pose of rigid objects and changes in intrinsic camera parameters, using only rough initial values for the parameters. The method is finally validated in an experiment using real images from a camera mounted on an industrial robot.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60056249","afid":"60056249","affilname":"Lunds Tekniska Högskola","affiliation-city":"Lund","affiliation-country":"Sweden"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57213645672","authid":"57213645672","authname":"Olsson T.","surname":"Olsson","given-name":"Tomas","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60056249"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57197092564","authid":"57197092564","authname":"Bengtsson J.","surname":"Bengtsson","given-name":"Johan","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60056249"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004026771","authid":"7004026771","authname":"Robertsson A.","surname":"Robertsson","given-name":"Anders","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60056249"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102588451","authid":"7102588451","authname":"Johansson R.","surname":"Johansson","given-name":"Rolf","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60056249"}]}],"source-id":"25456","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/1542329647"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/1542329647?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=1542329647&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=1542329647&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/1542329647","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:1542329647","eid":"2-s2.0-1542329647","dc:title":"An analysis of the quaternion attitude determination filter","dc:creator":"Pittelkau M.E.","prism:publicationName":"Advances in the Astronautical Sciences","prism:issn":"00653438","prism:volume":"114 II","prism:pageRange":"1337-1352","prism:coverDate":"2003-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2003","dc:description":"The full-quaternion attitude determination filter is analyzed to address questions of covariance singularity and quaternion normalization. It is shown how nonsingularity of the covariance in the Extended Kalman Filter depends on the initial covariance, the process noise matrix, and implementation details of the filter.

The effect of a quaternion measurement update on the covariance and on the norm of the estimated quaternion is analyzed. It is also shown that the multiplicative and additive quaternion updates are equivalent.

In this paper, we present an empirical study comparing the performance of unscented and extended Kalman filtering for improving human head and hand tracking. Specifically, we examine human head and hand orientation motion signals, represented with quaternions, which are critical for correct viewing perspectives in virtual reality. Our experimental results and analysis indicate that unscented Kalman filtering performs equivalently with extended Kalman filtering. However, the additional computational overhead of the unscented Kalman filter and quasi-linear nature of the quaternion dynamics lead to the conclusion that the extended Kalman filter is a better choice for estimating quaternion motion in virtual reality applications.","citedby-count":"243","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011460","afid":"60011460","affilname":"Brown University","affiliation-city":"Providence","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602792780","authid":"6602792780","authname":"LaViola J.J.","surname":"LaViola","given-name":"Joseph J.","initials":"J.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011460"}]}],"authkeywords":"Extended Kalman filtering | Human motion tracking | Quaternions | Unscented Kalman filtering | Virtual reality","source-id":"18692","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/1642399676"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/1642399676?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=1642399676&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=1642399676&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/1642399676","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:1642399676","eid":"2-s2.0-1642399676","dc:title":"Optical method for position-attitude determination between spacecraft based on computer vision","dc:creator":"Du X.","prism:publicationName":"Guangxue Jishu/Optical Technique","prism:issn":"10021582","prism:volume":"29","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"664-666","prism:coverDate":"2003-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2003","dc:description":"In order to realize autonomous control for formation-flying spacecraft, the relative state (relative position and attitude)between two space vehicles must be detected precisely.

The first half of the paper deals with constructions using field extensions of Q. Working with cyclotomic field extensions, we construct several families of STBCs over a wide range of signal sets that are of full rank, minimal delay, and rate at least one appropriate for any number of transmit antennas. We study the coding gain and capacity of these codes. Using transcendental extensions we construct arbitrary rate codes that are full rank for arbitrary number of antennas. We also present a method of constructing STBCs using noncyclotomic field extensions. In the later half of the paper, we discuss two ways of embedding noncommutative division algebras into matrices: left regular representation, and representation over maximal cyclic subfields. The 4 × 4 real orthogonal design is obtained by the left regular representation of quaternions. Alamouti's code is just a special case of the construction using representation over maximal cyclic subfields and we observe certain algebraic uniqueness characteristics of it. Also, we discuss a general principle for constructing cyclic division algebras using the nth root of a transcendental element and study the capacity of the STBCs obtained from this construction. Another family of cyclic division algebras discovered by Brauer is discussed and several examples of STBCs derived from each of these constructions are presented.","citedby-count":"352","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020975","afid":"60020975","affilname":"California State University, Northridge","affiliation-city":"Northridge","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014097","afid":"60014097","affilname":"Indian Institute of Science","affiliation-city":"Bengaluru","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005941","afid":"60005941","affilname":"Madras Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Chennai","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603353204","authid":"6603353204","authname":"Sethuraman B.A.","surname":"Sethuraman","given-name":"B.

Traditional approach for control design for the spacecraft large angle maneuver is a fixed gain proportional plus integral plus derivative (PID) controller using quaternion attitude variables with stability guarantee. Unwanted external disturbance inputs may induce excessively large error by the PID control. Anti-windup control and intelligent integrator are effective in reducing the rapid build up of the control signal due to, in particular, integral control action. Application of the anti-windup and intelligent integrator which already have been studied extensively in other areas is made to the large angle feedback controller minimizing reaction wheel type actuator saturation.

True vector correlation techniques, with global and interchannel measures, have only recently been demonstrated and are still in their infancy by comparison. This paper describes our work on vector correlation based on the use of hypercomplex Fourier transforms and presents, for the first time, a unified theory behind the information contained in the peak of a vector correlation response.

We introduce and present a novel approach to improve the reliability and robustness of the ICP (iterative closest point) 3D shape registration algorithm by smoothing the shape's surface into multiple resolutions. These smoothed surfaces are used in place of the original surface in a coarse-to-fine manner during registration, which allows the algorithm to avoid being trapped at local minima close to the global optimal solution. We used the technique of multiresolution analysis to create the smoothed surfaces efficiently. Besides being more robust, convergence is generally much faster, especially when combined with the point-to-plane error metric of Chen and Medioni. Since the point-to-plane error metric has no closed-form solution, solving it can be slow. We introduce a variant of the ICP algorithm that has convergence rate close to it but still uses the closed-form solution techniques (SIT) or unit quaternion methods) of the original ICP algorithm.","citedby-count":"13","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025111","afid":"60025111","affilname":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","affiliation-city":"Chapel Hill","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24468752100","authid":"24468752100","authname":"Low K.","surname":"Low","given-name":"K.

Previous color image watermarking methods are first presented and the quaternion representation is then described. In this framework RGB pixel values are associated with an unique quaternion number having three imaginary parts. The QFT is presented, this transform depends on an arbitrary unit pure quaternion μ. The value of μ is selected to provide embedding spaces having robustness and/or perceptual properties. In the presented approach μ is function of the mean color value of a block and a perceptual component. A watermarking scheme based on the QFT and the Quantization Index Modulation scheme is afterwards presented. This scheme is finally evaluated for different color image filtering process (JPEG, blur) and the fact that perceptive QFT embedding can offer robustness to luminance filtering techniques is outlined.","citedby-count":"112","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009236","afid":"60009236","affilname":"Institut polytechnique de Grenoble","affiliation-city":"Grenoble","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56273865800","authid":"56273865800","authname":"Bas P.","surname":"Bas","given-name":"Patrick","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009236"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6507015909","authid":"6507015909","authname":"Le Bihan N.","surname":"Le Bihan","given-name":"Nicolas","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009236"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003459040","authid":"7003459040","authname":"Chassery J.M.","surname":"Chassery","given-name":"Jean Marc","initials":"J.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009236"}]}],"source-id":"110544","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0037971559"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0037971559?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0037971559&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0037971559&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0031320303000505"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0037971559","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0037971559","eid":"2-s2.0-0037971559","dc:title":"Robust matching of 3D contours using iterative closest point algorithm improved by M-estimation","dc:creator":"Kaneko S.","prism:publicationName":"Pattern Recognition","prism:issn":"00313203","prism:volume":"36","prism:issueIdentifier":"9","prism:pageRange":"2041-2047","prism:coverDate":"2003-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"September 2003","prism:doi":"10.1016/S0031-3203(03)00050-5","pii":"S0031320303000505","dc:description":"An extension of the iterative closest point matching by M-estimation is proposed for realization of robustness to non-overlapping data or outlying data in two sets of contour data or depth images for rigid bodies. An objective function which includes independent residual components for each of x, y and z coordinates is originally defined and proposed to evaluate the fitness, simultaneously dealing with a distribution of outlying gross noise. The proposed procedure is based on modified M-estimation iterations with bi-weighting coefficients for selecting corresponding points for optimization of estimating the transforms for matching. The transforms can be represented by 'quaternions' in the procedure to eliminate redundancy in representation of rotational degree of freedom by linear matrices. Optimization steps are performed by the simplex method because it does not need computation of differentiation. Some fundamental experiments utilizing real data of 2D and 3D measurement show effectiveness of the proposed method. When reasonable initial positions are given, the unique solution of position could be provided in spite of surplus point data in the objects. And then the outlying data could be filtered out from the normal ones by the proposed method. © 2003 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.
