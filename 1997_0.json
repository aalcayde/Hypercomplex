Biophysical studies have implicated changes in nucleosome structure from chromatin that is quiescent to active in transcription. Since DNA within the nucleosome contains a high concentration of phosphorus whereas histone proteins do not, the nucleosome structure is amenable to microanalytical electron energy loss mapping of phosphorus to delineate the DNA within the protein-nucleic acid particle. Nucleosomes associated with transcriptionally active genes were separated from nucleosomes associated with quiescent genes using mercury-affinity chromatography. The three-dimensional image reconstruction methods for the total nucleosome structure and for the 3D DNA-phosphorus distribution combined quaternion-assisted angular reconstitution of sets of single particles at random orientations and electron spectroscopic imaging. The structure of the active nucleosome has the conformation of an open clam-shell, C- or U-shaped in one view, elongated in another, and exhibits a protein asymmetry. A three-dimensional phosphorus map reveals a conformational change in nucleosomal DNA compared to DNA in the canonical nucleosome structure. It indicates an altered superhelicity and is consistent with unfolding of the particle. The results address conformational changes of the nucleosome and provide a direct structural linkage to biochemical and physiological changes which parallel gene expression.","citedby-count":"18","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026827","afid":"60026827","affilname":"Rockefeller University","affiliation-city":"New York","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024613","afid":"60024613","affilname":"Carnegie Institution of Washington","affiliation-city":"Washington, D.C.","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016849","afid":"60016849","affilname":"University of Toronto","affiliation-city":"Toronto","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002306","afid":"60002306","affilname":"University of Calgary","affiliation-city":"Calgary","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"pubmed-id":"9519470","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701364513","authid":"6701364513","authname":"Czarnota G.J.","surname":"Czarnota","given-name":"Gregory J.","initials":"G.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016849"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005479088","authid":"7005479088","authname":"Bazett-Jones D.P.","surname":"Bazett-Jones","given-name":"David P.","initials":"D.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002306"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57197144504","authid":"57197144504","authname":"Mendez E.","surname":"Mendez","given-name":"Elizabeth","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026827"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024613"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006825894","authid":"7006825894","authname":"Allfrey V.G.","surname":"Allfrey","given-name":"Vincent G.","initials":"V.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026827"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005603129","authid":"7005603129","authname":"Ottensmeyer F.P.","surname":"Ottensmeyer","given-name":"F.

Because the canonical decomposition yields one-parameter basis groups, a localized form of correlation can be used to obtain measures of these 6 image deformations. In addition, since these basis functions obey the rules of quaternion algebra, they form an integrable representation of 2D motion, and are thereby compatible with methods of recursive estimation, such as Kalman filtering. Two principles of Visual Servoing are featured in the system which was developed to verify this model: The first is, that by nesting the perceptual module within an active robotic system, that the act of controlling the motion of the sensor adds important information, without which, the perception of certain observables would not be possible. Secondly, whether computer vision is used as a pre-processing stage before displaying information to a human operator, or whether that information will be used within an automated visual feedback loop, the following principle is common: The system is more efficient if the visual information can be transformed in a way which makes the task-specific information explicit.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010884","afid":"60010884","affilname":"Western University","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57199130946","authid":"57199130946","authname":"Wong M.","surname":"Wong","given-name":"Matthew","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010884"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603343533","authid":"6603343533","authname":"Eagleson R.","surname":"Eagleson","given-name":"Roy","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010884"}]}],"source-id":"51375","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0031247129"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0031247129?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0031247129&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0031247129&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0031247129","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0031247129","eid":"2-s2.0-0031247129","dc:title":"A three-step camera calibration method","dc:creator":"Bacakoglu H.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","prism:issn":"00189456","prism:volume":"46","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"1165-1172","prism:coverDate":"1997-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1997","prism:doi":"10.1109/19.676732","pii":"S0018945697091195","dc:description":"Camera calibration is a crucial problem for many industrial applications that incorporate visual sensing. In this paper, we compute the intrinsic and extrinsic calibration parameters in three steps. In the first step, the calibration parameters are approximated using the linear least-squares method. In the second step, we develop two alternative formulations to obtain an optimal rotation matrix from the calibration parameters computed in the first step. Further optimization of translational and perspective transformations is then performed based on the optimized rotation matrix. In the third step, a nonlinear optimization is performed to handle lens distortion. The solution of the nonlinear system not only minimizes the perspective transformation relations between the image points and the corresponding world coordinates, but also satisfies the orthonormality constraints on the rotational transformation. To assess the performance of our proposed method, the Euclidean norm of the error matrix between the calculated and the original 4x4 homogeneous transformation matrices is used as a basis for comparison with existing methods. Simulation results from applying the method show significant improvements both before and after the nonlinear optimization step. © 1997 HEBE.","citedby-count":"52","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014171","afid":"60014171","affilname":"University of Waterloo","affiliation-city":"Waterloo","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6508298928","authid":"6508298928","authname":"Bacakoglu H.","surname":"Bacakoglu","given-name":"Hakan","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014171"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/27169346300","authid":"27169346300","authname":"Kamel M.S.","surname":"Kamel","given-name":"Mohamed S.","initials":"M.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014171"}]}],"authkeywords":"Calibration | Cameras | Image sensors | Machine vision | Nonlinear optimization | Photogrammetry | Quaternions | Robot sensing","source-id":"15361","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0031139479"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0031139479?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0031139479&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0031139479&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0031139479","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0031139479","eid":"2-s2.0-0031139479","dc:title":"A novel block truncation coding of color images using a quaternion-moment-preserving principle","dc:creator":"Pel S.C.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","prism:issn":"00906778","prism:volume":"45","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"583-595","prism:coverDate":"1997-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1997","prism:doi":"10.1109/26.592558","pii":"S0090677897037185","dc:description":"-Block truncation coding (BTC) is an efficient tool for image compression.

Control architectures based on Neural Networks (NN) are developed in order to provide the system with adaptation capabilities when changes in the inertia properties occur. As a bonus, the inertia properties of the satellite can be estimated on-line. Since the mathematical model of a rigid satellite is nonlinear, the common NN approach would be to use nonlinear NN (NLNN) to approximate it. The structure of the NLNN must be defined by trial and error during the training process. This usually involves a great deal of time without any guarantee of success. On the other hand, the results of this research demonstrate that the full nonlinear problem can be solved utilizing linear NN (LNN), which can be designed rather than trained. The design takes advantage of the decoupling of the dynamics from the kinematics in the model structure and follows an inverse-dynamics control approach. The designed LNN receives angular velocity commands and generates the corresponding torque inputs. To cope with the nonlinearities, the corresponding signals are constructed externally and then fed to the LNN. The attitude is parameterized in terms of quaternions and controlled with a proportional feedback loop.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010401","afid":"60010401","affilname":"American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.","affiliation-city":"Reston","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003892","afid":"60003892","affilname":"Arizona State University","affiliation-city":"Tempe","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55953112900","authid":"55953112900","authname":"Rodríguez G.R.","surname":"Rodríguez","given-name":"Gustave Riestra","initials":"G.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003892"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701783290","authid":"6701783290","authname":"Puig-Suari J.","surname":"Puig-Suari","given-name":"Jordi","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003892"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010401"}]}],"source-id":"12376","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0031118513"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0031118513?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0031118513&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0031118513&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0031118513","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0031118513","eid":"2-s2.0-0031118513","dc:title":"Novel block truncation coding of color images using a quaternion-moment-preserving principle","dc:creator":"Pei S.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","prism:issn":"00906778","prism:volume":"45","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"485-486","prism:coverDate":"1997-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 1997","dc:description":"Block truncation coding (BTC) is an efficient tool for image compression.

Using a look-up table to display decoded data, this postprocessing scheme can output images acceptable to human eyes.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005429","afid":"60005429","affilname":"National Taiwan University","affiliation-city":"Taipei","affiliation-country":"Taiwan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202463605","authid":"7202463605","authname":"Pei S.","surname":"Pei","given-name":"Soo Chang","initials":"S.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005429"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57198497260","authid":"57198497260","authname":"Cheng C.","surname":"Cheng","given-name":"Ching Min","initials":"C.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005429"}]}],"source-id":"18931","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0031104970"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0031104970?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0031104970&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0031104970&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0893608096000482"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0031104970","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0031104970","eid":"2-s2.0-0031104970","dc:title":"Multilayer perceptrons to approximate quaternion valued functions","dc:creator":"Arena P.","prism:publicationName":"Neural Networks","prism:issn":"08936080","prism:volume":"10","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"335-342","prism:coverDate":"1997-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"March 1997","prism:doi":"10.1016/S0893-6080(96)00048-2","pii":"S0893608096000482","dc:description":"In this paper a new type of multilayer feedforward neural network is introduced. Such a structure, called hypercomplex multilayer perceptron (HMLP), is developed in quaternion algebra and allows quaternionic input and output signals to be dealt with, requiring a lower number of neurons than the real MLP, thus providing a reduced computational complexity. The structure introduced represents a generalization of the multilayer perceptron in the complex space (CMLP) reported in the literature. The fundamental result reported in the paper is a new density theorem which makes HMLPs universal interpolators of quaternion valued continuous functions. Moreover the proof of the density theorem can be restricted in ordsr to formulate a density theorem in the complex space. Due to the identity between the quaternion and the four-dimensional real space, such a structure is also useful to approximate multidimensional real valued functions with a lower number of real parameters, decreasing the probability of being trapped in local minima during the learning phase. A numerical example is also reported in order to show the efficiency of the proposed structure.","citedby-count":"117","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010146","afid":"60010146","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Catania","affiliation-city":"Catania","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23003603300","authid":"23003603300","authname":"Arena P.","surname":"Arena","given-name":"P.","initials":"P."},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006124439","authid":"7006124439","authname":"Fortuna L.","surname":"Fortuna","given-name":"L.","initials":"L."},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004697984","authid":"7004697984","authname":"Muscato G.","surname":"Muscato","given-name":"G.","initials":"G."},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701759021","authid":"6701759021","authname":"Xibilia M.","surname":"Xibilia","given-name":"Maria Gabriella","initials":"M.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010146"}]}],"authkeywords":"density theorem | function approximation | neural networks | quaternion","source-id":"24804","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030990813"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030990813?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0030990813&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0030990813&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0968432897000097"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030990813","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0030990813","eid":"2-s2.0-0030990813","dc:title":"Three-dimensional architecture of Thermomyces lanuginosus small subunit ribosomal RNA","dc:creator":"Beniac D.R.","prism:publicationName":"Micron","prism:issn":"09684328","prism:volume":"28","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"13-20","prism:coverDate":"1997-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"February 1997","prism:doi":"10.1016/S0968-4328(97)00009-7","pii":"S0968432897000097","dc:description":"The structure of the small ribosomal subunit of the mildly thermophilic fungus Thermomyces lanuginosus was reconstructed using spectroscopic electron microscopy and quaternion-assisted angular reconstitution to a resolution of roughly 3.3 nm.

We propose an algorithm that uses models for object surfaces and their motion and estimates the model parameters using the image intensity matching criterion. The visible scene surface is represented with a parametrically deformable, spatially adaptive, wireframe model. Object motion is first modeled using the well-known rigid motion assumption along with the quaternion rotation representation. Nonrigid motion modeling using the finite element technique is also investigated as an alternative to rigid motion modeling or as a refinement of it. A functional containing image matching and surface smoothness constraints is minimized with respect to the unknown model parameters. A discontinuity detection scheme allowing deactivation of smoothness constraints across object boundaries, is investigated. A regularization scheme using a coarse to fine strategy is employed. © 1997 Academic Press.","citedby-count":"31","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015331","afid":"60015331","affilname":"Aristotle University of Thessaloniki","affiliation-city":"Thessaloniki","affiliation-country":"Greece"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35614013900","authid":"35614013900","authname":"Malassiotis S.","surname":"Malassiotis","given-name":"Sotiris","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015331"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102524459","authid":"7102524459","authname":"Strintzis M.G.","surname":"Strintzis","given-name":"Michael G.","initials":"M.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015331"}]}],"source-id":"24161","fund-acr":"EC","fund-no":"R2045","fund-sponsor":"European Commission","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030736857"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030736857?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0030736857&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0030736857&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030736857","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0030736857","eid":"2-s2.0-0030736857","dc:title":"Realization of a faster, cheaper, better star tracker for the new millennium","dc:creator":"Eisenman A.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Aerospace Applications Conference Proceedings","prism:volume":"2","prism:pageRange":"327-336","prism:coverDate":"1997-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1997","dc:description":"The Advanced Stellar Compass (ASC) is a second generation star tracker consisting of a CCD camera and its associated microcomputer. It is a true, multi-star tracker which was designed for the Orsted mission, a precision mapper of the Earth's magnetic field. The ASC operates by matching the star images acquired by the camera to internal star catalogs. An initial attitude acquisition (solving the lost in space problem) is performed, and then the attitude of the camera is calculated in celestial coordinates by averaging the position of a large number of star observations for each image. The ASC features high accuracy, a smooth response to changing star fields, high boresight stability, low power and mass, robust autonomy, quaternion output and low cost. It is readily adapted to a wide range of missions, four of which are cited. Key parameters of the ASC for the Orsted and Astrid II satellites are: mass as low as 900 g; power consumption as low as 5.5 W; a single axis, relative, attitude angle error of less than 1.4 arcsec, RMS (which is close to 1 σ) and a twist, or roll angle, relative accuracy of less than 13 arcsec, RMS, as measured at the Mauna Kea, Hawaii observatories of the University of Hawaii in June 1996.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009037","afid":"60009037","affilname":"Jet Propulsion Laboratory","affiliation-city":"Pasadena","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003269206","authid":"7003269206","authname":"Eisenman A.","surname":"Eisenman","given-name":"Allan Read","initials":"A.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009037"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55965478000","authid":"55965478000","authname":"Liebe C.","surname":"Liebe","given-name":"Carl Christian","initials":"C.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009037"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56025657000","authid":"56025657000","authname":"Jorgensen J.","surname":"Jorgensen","given-name":"John Leif","initials":"J.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009037"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201969557","authid":"7201969557","authname":"Jensen G.","surname":"Jensen","given-name":"Gunnar Bent","initials":"G.B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009037"}]}],"source-id":"78749","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030707855"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030707855?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0030707855&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0030707855&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030707855","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0030707855","eid":"2-s2.0-0030707855","dc:title":"The in situ architecture of Escherichia coli ribosomal RNA derived by electron spectroscopic imaging and three-dimensional reconstruction","dc:creator":"Beniac D.R.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Microscopy","prism:issn":"00222720","prism:volume":"188","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"24-35","prism:coverDate":"1997-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1997","prism:doi":"10.1046/j.1365-2818.1997.2370795.x","dc:description":"The structures of the large and small ribosomal subunits of Escherichia coli were reconstructed using spectroscopic electron microscopy and quaternion-assisted angular reconstitution to resolutions of better than 4nm.

The three-dimensional reconstruction of the distribution of this atomic element is an extension of microanalysis (in two dimensions) for phosphorus identification and mapping, as a signature of the arrangement of the phosphate backbones of the constituent ribosomal RNAs. The results on both the phosphorus reconstructions and the total reconstructions (protein and ribosomal RNA) reveal several passageways through both subunits. The structures correspond favourably with other independent reconstructions of the whole E. coli ribosome from cryoelectron micrographs and their accompanying models of translation (Frank et al.

We calculate curvature and torsion of curves in S3 by Mathematica. The Gauss map ν of a surface in E4 is decomposed into the two maps ν+ and ν-. If the surface is contained in S3, we can define another Gauss map νs. We use Mathematica to visualize the shapes of the images of these Gauss maps.

To identify the nature of these higher-order dependencies, we analyze the bispectra and trispectra of natural images. Our investigations reveal substantial statistical dependencies between those frequency components which are aligned to each other with respect to orientation. We argue that operators which are selective to local intrinsic dimensionality can optimally exploit such redundancies. We also show that the polyspectral structure we find for natural images helps to understand the hitherto unexplained superiority of orientation-selective filter decompositions over isotropic schemes like the Laplacian pyramid. However, any essentially linear scheme can only partially exploit this higher-order redundancy. We therefore propose nonlinear i2D-selective operators which exhibit close resemblance to hypercomplex and end-stopped cells in the visual cortex. The function of these operators can be interpreted as a higher-order whitening of the input signal.","citedby-count":"19","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028717","afid":"60028717","affilname":"Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München","affiliation-city":"Munich","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006079333","authid":"7006079333","authname":"Krieger G.","surname":"Krieger","given-name":"Gerhard","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028717"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56021568900","authid":"56021568900","authname":"Zetzsche C.","surname":"Zetzsche","given-name":"Christoph","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028717"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35616238000","authid":"35616238000","authname":"Barth E.","surname":"Barth","given-name":"Erhardt","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028717"}]}],"source-id":"52093","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030686684"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030686684?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0030686684&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0030686684&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030686684","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0030686684","eid":"2-s2.0-0030686684","dc:title":"Registration of 3-D partial surface models using luminance and depth information","dc:creator":"Weik S.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the International Conference on Recent Advances in 3-D Digital Imaging and Modeling","prism:pageRange":"93-100","prism:coverDate":"1997-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1997","dc:description":"Textured surface models of three-dimensional objects are gaining importance in computer graphics applications. These models often have to be merged from several overlapping partial models which have to be registered (i.e. the relative transformation between the partial models has to be determined) prior to the merging process. In this paper a method is presented that makes use of both camera-based depth information (e.g. from stereo) and the luminance image. The luminance information is exploited to determine corresponding point sets on the partial surfaces using an optical flow approach. Quaternions are then employed to determine the transformation between the partial models which minimizes the sum of the 3-D Euclidian distances between the corresponding point sets. In order to find corresponding points on the partial surfaces luminance information is linearized. The procedure is iterated until convergence is reached. In contrast to only using depth information, employing luminance speeds up convergence and reduces remaining degrees of freedom (e.g. when registering sphere-like shapes).","citedby-count":"103","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004935","afid":"60004935","affilname":"Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Universität Hannover","affiliation-city":"Hannover","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56636683900","authid":"56636683900","authname":"Weik S.","surname":"Weik","given-name":"S.","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004935"}]}],"source-id":"60496","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030685519"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030685519?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0030685519&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0030685519&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030685519","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0030685519","eid":"2-s2.0-0030685519","dc:title":"Proceedings of the 1997 International Conference on Information Visualization, IV","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the Information Visualization Conference","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"1997-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1997","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 50 papers from the 1997 International Conference on Information Visualization.

On the other hand, this scheme causes little increase in the burden of generation and verification of digital signature for the legitimate users, with respect to the original OSS scheme.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031126","afid":"60031126","affilname":"Tokyo Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tokyo","affiliation-country":"Japan"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028263","afid":"60028263","affilname":"Saitama University","affiliation-city":"Saitama","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403584614","authid":"7403584614","authname":"Satoh T.","surname":"Satoh","given-name":"Takakazu","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028263"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402551666","authid":"7402551666","authname":"Araki K.","surname":"Araki","given-name":"Kiyomichi","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031126"}]}],"authkeywords":"Cryptanalysis | Integral quaternion | Non-commutativity | OSS digital signature","source-id":"26076","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030651103"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030651103?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0030651103&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0030651103&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030651103","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0030651103","eid":"2-s2.0-0030651103","dc:title":"Fast construction of accurate quaternion splines","dc:creator":"Ramamoorthi R.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the ACM SIGGRAPH Conference on Computer Graphics","prism:pageRange":"287-292","prism:coverDate":"1997-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1997","dc:description":"In 1992, Barr et al. proposed a method for interpolating orientations with unit quaternion curves by minimizing covariant acceleration.

The extended Kalman filter framework is employed to estimate the rotation between frames, which is represented using unit quaternions. A small set of automatically selected and tracked feature points are used as measurements. The effectiveness of this technique is also demonstrated by constructing mosaic images from the motion estimates, and comparing them to mosaics built from 2D stabilization algorithms. Two different stabilization schemes are presented. The first, implemented in a real-time platform based on a Datacube MV200 board, estimates the motion between two consecutive frames and is able to process gray level images of resolution 128×120 at 10 Hz. The second scheme estimates the motion between the current frame and an inverse mosaic; this allows better estimation without the need for indexing the new image frames. Experimental results for both schemes using real and synthetic image sequences are presented.","citedby-count":"46","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020304","afid":"60020304","affilname":"University of Maryland, College Park","affiliation-city":"College Park","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102275798","authid":"7102275798","authname":"Morimoto C.","surname":"Morimoto","given-name":"Carlos","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020304"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203078416","authid":"57203078416","authname":"Chellappa R.","surname":"Chellappa","given-name":"Rama","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020304"}]}],"source-id":"24212","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030634087"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030634087?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0030634087&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0030634087&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1090780796974832"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030634087","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0030634087","eid":"2-s2.0-0030634087","dc:title":"Adiabatic Slice-Selective Excitation for Surface Coils","dc:creator":"Shen J.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Magnetic Resonance","prism:issn":"10907807","prism:volume":"124","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"72-79","prism:coverDate":"1997-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"January 1997","prism:doi":"10.1006/jmre.1996.7483","pii":"S1090780796974832","dc:description":"A novel RF pulse designed to perform a diabatic s lice-selective excitation for surface coils (ASSESS) is proposed in which B0 gradient is modulated in concert with RF frequency modulation. Within the selected slice, the principles of BIR4 pulses are employed to obtain well-defined, pure-phase and self-refocused spin rotation of arbitrary flip angles despite the presence of high B1 inhomogeneity produced by surface coils. Outside the slice, advantage is taken of the B1 field to dephase equilibrium magnetization to achieve slice selection or outer-volume suppression. This scheme should be useful for many localization techniques. Quaternion analysis of the overall propagator of the proposed pulse and numerical simulations using Bloch equations are performed. The pulse is tested experimentally on a phantom sample. © 1997 Academic Press.","citedby-count":"16","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017994","afid":"60017994","affilname":"Yale School of Medicine","affiliation-city":"New Haven","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"pubmed-id":"9169211","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404929917","authid":"7404929917","authname":"Shen J.","surname":"Shen","given-name":"Jun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017994"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7103056860","authid":"7103056860","authname":"Rothman D.","surname":"Rothman","given-name":"Douglas L.","initials":"D.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017994"}]}],"source-id":"28525","fund-acr":"NIH","fund-no":"EY10856-02","fund-sponsor":"National Institutes of Health","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherhybridgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Hybrid Gold"}]}}]}}
