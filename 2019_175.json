Instead of 3-D rotations as usually, 4-D transformations for encryption with quaternions and 8-D with octonions are suggested. Such size of transformation matrices increases the size of plaintext/ciphertext blocks and eliminates the need to calculate elements of rotation matrices. To speed up an encryption process the HW-R4, HW-QES, and HW-OES include mainly addition and shift operations with modular arithmetic. In our experiments, we used a product Intel (former Altera) OpenCL SDK (AOCL), which allows compiling OpenCL programs for FPGAs. The launch of the developed algorithms was carried out on two devices: the Intel Core i7 920 CPU and the Terasic DE5-Net FPGA (Stratix V). Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms and modifications are about 30–50% more effective in the encryption speed of signals than the original HW-QES/HW-OES. Additionally, HW-R4 is shown to be more effective in the encryption quality of images than the original QES. Our approach can also be used for robustness increasing when the Feistel network is added to the system.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60113190","afid":"60113190","affilname":"Admiral Ushakov Maritime State University","affiliation-city":"Novorossiysk","affiliation-country":"Russian Federation"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029073","afid":"60029073","affilname":"Volgograd State Technical University","affiliation-city":"Volgograd","affiliation-country":"Russian Federation"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55931357700","authid":"55931357700","authname":"Andreev A.","surname":"Andreev","given-name":"Andrey","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029073"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57210810772","authid":"57210810772","authname":"Chalyshev M.","surname":"Chalyshev","given-name":"Mikhail","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029073"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55930245000","authid":"55930245000","orcid":"0000-0001-9087-3275","authname":"Egunov V.","surname":"Egunov","given-name":"Vitaly","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029073"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23667001400","authid":"23667001400","authname":"Doukhnitch E.","surname":"Doukhnitch","given-name":"Evgueni","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60113190"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57210815820","authid":"57210815820","orcid":"0000-0002-6947-9131","authname":"Kuznetsova K.","surname":"Kuznetsova","given-name":"Kristina","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60113190"}]}],"authkeywords":"Altera/Intel OpenCL SDK | Encryption | FPGA | HW-OES | HW-QES | HW-R4 | Image/Signal encryption | Known plaintext-ciphertext attack | Octonion | Quaternion","source-id":"17700155007","fund-acr":"РФФИ","fund-no":"18-47-340010","fund-sponsor":"Russian Foundation for Basic Research","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071493324"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071493324?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85071493324&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85071493324&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071493324","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85071493324","eid":"2-s2.0-85071493324","dc:title":"Implementing HuPf Algorithm for the Inverse Kinematics of General 6R/P Manipulators","dc:creator":"Capco J.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783030268305"}],"prism:volume":"11661 LNCS","prism:pageRange":"78-90","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-26831-2_6","dc:description":"We reformulate and extend the HuPf algorithm (see [7]), which was originally designed for a general 6R manipulator (i.e. 6 jointed open serial chain/robot with only rotational joints), to solve the inverse kinematic (IK) problem of 6R/P manipulators (6-jointed open serial robot with joints that are either rotational or prismatic/translational).

However, all the existing FCN-based algorithms use real-valued FCN to process each channel separately. As a consequence, they fail to capture the inherent correlation between color channels and the integrity of three channels. So, in this paper, quaternion fully convolutional network (QFCN) is proposed to generalize FCN to quaternion domain by replacing real-valued conventional blocks in FCN with quaternion conventional blocks. In addition, a new color image splicing localization algorithm is proposed by combining QFCNs and superpixel (SP)-enhanced pairwise conditional random field (CRF).

Many reservoirs have been discovered and determined by the generation and recording of P waves only, but the P wave alone cannot provide a comprehensive description of the reservoir characteristics. In some studies, S-wave information is required in addition to P-wave information to get a correct estimation from reservoir properties. By the three component seismic acquisition, P and S waves’ information can be recorded simultaneously. More often in seismic surveys, one cannot sample seismic wave field uniformly the along spatial direction due to environment limitations or instrument malfunctions; inevitably we have to use interpolation methods for reconstruction of missing traces. Reconstruction of missing or noisy traces is done using the projection onto convex sets (POCS). The POCS algorithm is a simple algorithm which is suitable for reconstruction of irregularly lost traces in a regular grid using multiple repetitive Fourier transforms. Conventional methods for reconstruction of missing traces in three component acquisition is usually done by implementation of POCS on each component separately, which could damage any subtle features in the record. This research introduces a method to reconstruct all three components at once using the quaternion Fourier transform and Projection onto Convex Sets (QPOCS).Quaternions in mathematics are a commutative numbers system that extend the complex numbers system. As the ordinary complex numbers can be displayed on two dimensions, these numbers can also be displayed on four dimensions. Quaternions were first introduced by William Rowan Hamilton when looking for a way to extend complex numbers to three dimensions. He knew how to sum and multiply three-dimensional numbers, but he was looking for a way to divide these numbers into each other. In 1843, Hamilton discovered that the division of quaternions requires a fourth dimension. Quaternion Algebra is often shown with H (in honor of Hamilton). The two-component data vector representation in the frequency domain can be obtained by putting the real and imaginary parts of each component in the arguments of a quaternion. This method allows operators to apply both components simultaneously. Quaternions are converted to Frequency-wavenumber domain by Quaternion Fourier Transform (QFT) and a single domain spectrum for both components is defined using the polar representation of the Quaternions. Quaternions have other applications in seismic data processing such as computing spectral attributes, multi-component velocity analysis and multi-component deconvolution. The advantage of this method is because of the spectral overlapping of the components in the frequency-wavenumber domain, thus the perpendicularity of input components is preserved (signals are not interconnected) and similarities between components are maintained that helps improve the quality of reconstruction. The coding of this method has been done in MATLAB environment and results of applying the proposed method on 3-component synthetic and real seismic data are compared to that of the POCS algorithm when applied on each component separately. The results of reconstruction using QPOCS algorithm indicate a better quality for reconstructed seismic data and in the output data, the percentage of produced artifacts is lower than that of the POCS algorithm on each component alone.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031777","afid":"60031777","affilname":"Islamic Azad University","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022927","afid":"60022927","affilname":"University of Tehran","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57212616283","authid":"57212616283","authname":"Eftekhari A.","surname":"Eftekhari","given-name":"A.","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031777"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12788807300","authid":"12788807300","authname":"Siahkoohi H.R.","surname":"Siahkoohi","given-name":"H.

However, when used for quaternion signal processing, extreme learning machine cannot make full use of the cross-channel correlation and quaternion statistics and thus often provides only suboptimal solutions. To this end, in this paper, we extend the extreme learning machine to quaternion domain and then propose two augmented quaternion extreme learning machine models for quaternion signal processing. These two models incorporate the involutions of the network input and hidden nodes, respectively, and can fully capture the second-order statistics of quaternion signals. In order to overcome the possible overfitting problem, two corresponding regularized augmented algorithms are also derived with the help of the generalized HR calculus. The superiority of the proposed models is verified by the simulation results.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029322","afid":"60029322","affilname":"Dalian Maritime University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/122364978","afid":"122364978","affilname":"Hrg (Shandong) Intelligent Equipment Research Institute","affiliation-city":"Jinan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35933005200","authid":"35933005200","orcid":"0000-0001-7394-7295","authname":"Zhang H.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Huisheng","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029322"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57210281842","authid":"57210281842","authname":"Lv H.","surname":"Lv","given-name":"Hui","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029322"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"122364978"}]}],"authkeywords":"augmented quaternion statistics | Extreme learning machine | quaternion signal processing | regularization","article-number":"8752405","source-id":"21100374601","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"JJKH20170914KJ","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85070193281"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85070193281?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85070193281&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85070193281&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85070193281","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85070193281","eid":"2-s2.0-85070193281","dc:title":"On the fly generated data for industrial part orientation estimation with deep neural networks","dc:creator":"Langlois J.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","prism:issn":"0277786X","prism:eIssn":"1996756X","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781510630536"}],"prism:volume":"11172","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","prism:doi":"10.1117/12.2521753","dc:description":"In this paper a method is proposed for estimating the orientation of industrial parts. Classical 2d images of the part are used to train a deep neural network and infer the part pose by computing its quaternion representation. Another innovative point of this work is in the use of synthetic data which are generated on the fly during the network training from a textured cad model placed in a virtual scene. This way overcomes the difficulties to obtain pose ground truth images from real images. At the same time, using the cad model with several lighting conditions and material reflectances allows to anticipate challenging industrial situations. As a first step of the method, the part is separated from the background using a semantic segmentation network. Then a depth image of the part is produced employing an encoder-decoder network with skip connections. Finally, the depth map is associated with the local pixels coordinates to estimate the part orientation with a fully connected network using a SO(3) metric loss function. This method can estimate the part pose from real images with visually convincing results suitable for any pose refinement processes.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032006","afid":"60032006","affilname":"Nantes Université","affiliation-city":"Nantes","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/122958207","afid":"122958207","affilname":"Multitude-Technologies, Company of Wedo","affiliation-city":null,"affiliation-country":null}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203514321","authid":"57203514321","authname":"Langlois J.","surname":"Langlois","given-name":"J.","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"122958207"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16024847700","authid":"16024847700","authname":"Mouchère H.","surname":"Mouchère","given-name":"H.","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032006"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603951502","authid":"6603951502","authname":"Normand N.","surname":"Normand","given-name":"N.","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032006"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9133978000","authid":"9133978000","authname":"Viard-Gaudin C.","surname":"Viard-Gaudin","given-name":"C.","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032006"}]}],"authkeywords":"Convolutional neural networks | Deep neural networks | Depth estimation | Industrial Parts | Pose estimation | Rendered data","article-number":"111720I","source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068984635"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068984635?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85068984635&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85068984635&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068984635","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85068984635","eid":"2-s2.0-85068984635","dc:title":"Improved Two-Dimensional Quaternion Principal Component Analysis","dc:creator":"Zhao M.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Access","prism:eIssn":"21693536","prism:volume":"7","prism:pageRange":"79409-79417","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","prism:doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2923359","dc:description":"The two-dimensional quaternion principal component analysis (2D-QPCA) is first improved into abstracting the features of quaternion matrix samples in both row and column directions, being the generalization ability, and with the components weighted by corresponding eigenvalues.

With such generalization ability, 2D-QPCA may enlarge the variance of all projections of known and unknown samples.

A star tracker is a flexible attitude sensor, which meets the requirements of a CubeSat. The objective of this paper is to develop an arc-minute accurate star tracker algorithm for CubeSats, and to analyze the results using a software-in-the-loop simulation. The algorithm is divided into three main parts: centroiding, Lost-in-Space (LIS) mode, and tracking mode. The weight sum method is used in centroiding, the voting method and quaternion-estimator (QUEST) method are used in the LIS mode, and the extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and catalog partitioning are used in tracking. Stars images are simulated to verify the algorithm. We evaluate centroid accuracy under different noise levels and star magnitudes, and the results have sub-pixel accuracy. In addition, we show the performance of LIS algorithm. With an appropriate voting tolerance, over 80% of the stars are correctly matched, the attitude estimations have arc-minute accuracy, and the matching results have over a 95% success rate. Also, the performance of the tracking algorithm is showed.

However, infrared small target images often suffer from low contrast. In this paper, we propose an infrared small target detection method that improves the target contrast and suppresses background clutters based on spatial-temporal enhancement using the quaternion discrete cosine transform (QDCT). The proposed method is twofold: 1) we propose to detect the infrared small target by constructing the quaternion feature map for infrared images. The quaternion integrates four feature maps, including the kurtosis feature, two directional feature maps extracted by steerable filtering in spatial domain and motion feature in the temporal domain. 2) Then the quaternion is input into QDCT, and the saliency maps of each feature channel can be obtained by sign function processing. The final detection result is obtained by inverse QDCT to the quaternion. Compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed method has a lower false alarm rate when the same positive detection rate is achieved.","citedby-count":"31","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020650","afid":"60020650","affilname":"University of Bristol","affiliation-city":"Bristol","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005465","afid":"60005465","affilname":"University of Electronic Science and Technology of China","affiliation-city":"Chengdu","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56233453300","authid":"56233453300","orcid":"0000-0002-8330-2164","authname":"Zhang P.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Ping","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57197873222","authid":"57197873222","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiaowei","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56912474600","authid":"56912474600","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiaoyang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020650"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/37116702900","authid":"37116702900","authname":"Fei C.","surname":"Fei","given-name":"Chun","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209248572","authid":"57209248572","authname":"Guo Z.","surname":"Guo","given-name":"Zhengkui","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]}],"authkeywords":"Infrared (IR) small target detection | kurtosis feature | quaternion discrete cosine transform (QDCT) | steerable filter","article-number":"8698272","source-id":"21100374601","fund-no":"2018GZ0166","fund-sponsor":"Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065307753"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065307753?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85065307753&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85065307753&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065307753","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85065307753","eid":"2-s2.0-85065307753","dc:title":"Gender Classification from NIR Images by Using Quadrature Encoding Filters of the Most Relevant Features","dc:creator":"Tapia J.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Access","prism:eIssn":"21693536","prism:volume":"7","prism:pageRange":"29114-29127","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","prism:doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2902470","dc:description":"In the past few years, accuracy in determining gender from iris images has increased significantly, approaching levels that make novel applications of this biometric technology feasible. In this paper, we report the gender classification rate by using a 2-D Quadrature Quaternionic filter, and a selection of the most relevant features from the normalized iris images. We encoded the phase information of the normalized images using 4 bits per pixel with a 2-D-Gabor filter and selected the best bits from the four resulting images (1 real and 3 imaginary) instead of the 1-D log-Gabor traditional encoding method. We used traditional hand-crafted and automatic methods to select and extract the most relevant features from the whole iris images, blocks from images, and pixel features and compared how effective these methods were in separating features from female and male iris images. Selecting iris blocks and features reduce the computational time and, at a basic science level, is of great value in understanding what information features, as well as pixels from the iris, can be extracted to classify gender. The Quaternionic-Code with the complementary feature selection method achieved the best results on the GFI-UND database with 93.45% for the left iris and 95.45% for the right iris, both with 2400 selected features. We compared our results and found them to be advantageous to the best results previously published, and also to those obtained using convolutional neural network feature extraction.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60122505","afid":"60122505","affilname":"Advanced Mining Technology Center","affiliation-city":"Santiago","affiliation-country":"Chile"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60088734","afid":"60088734","affilname":"Universidad Tecnologica de Chile","affiliation-city":"Arica","affiliation-country":"Chile"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012464","afid":"60012464","affilname":"Universidad de Chile","affiliation-city":"Santiago","affiliation-country":"Chile"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005419930","authid":"7005419930","orcid":"0000-0001-9159-4075","authname":"Tapia J.","surname":"Tapia","given-name":"Juan E.","initials":"J.E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60088734"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401782386","authid":"7401782386","orcid":"0000-0002-5484-4159","authname":"Perez C.","surname":"Perez","given-name":"Claudio A.","initials":"C.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122505"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012464"}]}],"authkeywords":"gender classification | gender from iris | iris relevant features | Soft-biometrics","article-number":"8656515","source-id":"21100374601","fund-acr":"FONDECYT","fund-no":"11170189","fund-sponsor":"Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065210162"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065210162?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85065210162&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85065210162&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065210162","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85065210162","eid":"2-s2.0-85065210162","dc:title":"UAV's Agricultural Image Segmentation Predicated by Clifford Geometric Algebra","dc:creator":"Khan P.W.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Access","prism:eIssn":"21693536","prism:volume":"7","prism:pageRange":"38442-38450","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","prism:doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2906033","dc:description":"Image segmentation is widely used in the field of agriculture to improve the yields and protecting them from pests, herbs, shrubs, and weeds.

The Clifford geometric algebra is also sometimes used as a collective term for the diverse range of mathematical fields, both classical and modern algebraic mathematics. Previous image segmentation approaches depend upon the intensity of red, green, and blue colors; but the complete perspective could not be obtained from these approaches. Geometric algebra overcomes this limitation and leads to a genuine color space image processing. It is mainly used in the processing of medical images. Subalgebra of the Clifford algebra is Quaternions. We have used this approach in agricultural images. The image segmentation of foreground and background is enhanced using Clifford geometric algebra; hence, the results obtained are fine-tuned segmented images.

The new colour quaternion filter bank is constructed by using radon transform. Starting from link with structure tensors, the authors propose a new multi-scale tool for vector-valued signals which can provide efficient analysis of local features by using the concepts of amplitude, phase, and orientation. To demonstrate the properties of CQWT, new colour image denoising algorithm is proposed by using CQWT and bivariate shrinkage function. The performance of the proposed algorithm is experimentally verified on a variety of noise levels. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance both in visual quality and objective peak-signal-to-noise ratio, mean square error, and structure similarity values, compared with other state-of-the-art denoising algorithms.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60083519","afid":"60083519","affilname":"Nanchang Hangkong University","affiliation-city":"Nanchang","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031706","afid":"60031706","affilname":"Utah State University","affiliation-city":"Logan","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35748407200","authid":"35748407200","authname":"Gai S.","surname":"Gai","given-name":"Shan","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60083519"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57208443320","authid":"57208443320","authname":"Bao Z.","surname":"Bao","given-name":"Zhongyun","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60083519"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57200212892","authid":"57200212892","authname":"Zhang K.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Kaige","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031706"}]}],"source-id":"6100153106","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61563037","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064636604"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064636604?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85064636604&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85064636604&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064636604","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85064636604","eid":"2-s2.0-85064636604","dc:title":"Data acquisition from the integration of Kinect quaternions and Myo armband EMG sensors to aid equinus foot treatment","dc:creator":"Araújo F.M.A.","prism:publicationName":"BIODEVICES 2019 - 12th International Conference on Biomedical Electronics and Devices, Proceedings; Part of 12th International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies, BIOSTEC 2019","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789897583537"}],"prism:pageRange":"235-240","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","prism:doi":"10.5220/0007565902350240","dc:description":"This paper shows the advantage of using different sensors such the Microsoft Kinect and Myo Armband to acquire movement description of the plantarflexion and dorsiflexion of the foot with the help of the quaternions and the EMG Myo sensor.

An improved adaptive algorithm of multisensor attitude data fusion is proposed. The nonlinear equations of vehicle attitude quaternions are constructed by using the test information of accelerometers and magnetometers. Then, a complementary filter is used to fuse the obtained attitude with gyroscope information to obtain attitude information during vehicle travel. Weight matrix and filter coefficients in the algorithm are adjusted with vehicle motions to ensure accuracy of attitude measurement under static, low-, and high-acceleration conditions. The vehicle vibration displacement information is reconstructed by the low-frequency attenuation integration method on the basis of attitude measurement to inhibit integral trend items and reduce vibration displacement reconstruction errors. The three-state controller is designed to control a six-degree-of-freedom hydraulic simulated vibration test bed, and the obtained vibration signal is used as an excitation signal to perform a vibration representation control test. Finally, results verify that the proposed method demonstrates favourable data fusion and representation accuracy.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018465","afid":"60018465","affilname":"Yanshan University","affiliation-city":"Qinhuangdao","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/112145551","afid":"112145551","affilname":"HiRain Technologies","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201566035","authid":"7201566035","orcid":"0000-0003-0713-2578","authname":"Gong M.","surname":"Gong","given-name":"Mingde","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018465"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57208306964","authid":"57208306964","authname":"Zhao B.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Baoqiang","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"112145551"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57208307865","authid":"57208307865","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018465"}]}],"article-number":"9808604","source-id":"13511","fund-no":"2016YFC0802900","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063881121"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063881121?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85063881121&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85063881121&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063881121","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85063881121","eid":"2-s2.0-85063881121","dc:title":"Infrared LEDs-Based Pose Estimation with Underground Camera Model for Boom-Type Roadheader in Coal Mining","dc:creator":"Yang W.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Access","prism:eIssn":"21693536","prism:volume":"7","prism:pageRange":"33698-33712","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","prism:doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2904097","dc:description":"Accurate and reliable pose estimation of a boom-type roadheader is of great importance in order to maintain the efficiency of automatic coal mining. The stability and accuracy of conventional measurement methods are difficult to be guaranteed on account of vibration noise, magnetic disturbance, electrostatic interference, and other factors in an underground environment. In this paper, a vision-based non-contact measurement method for cutting-head pose estimation is presented, which deploy a 16-point infrared LED target on the boom-type roadheader to tackle the low-illumination, high-dust, and complicated background. By establishing a monocular vision measurement system, the cutting-head pose is estimated through processing the LED target images obtained from an explosion-proof industrial camera mounted on the roadheader. After analyzing the measurement mechanism, an underground camera model based on the equivalent focal length is built to eliminate refraction errors caused by the two-layer glasses for explosion-proof and dust removal. Then, the pose estimation processes, including infrared LEDs feature point extraction, spot center location, and an improved P4P method based on dual quaternions, are carried out. The influence factors of cutting-head pose estimation accuracy are further studied by modeling, and the error distribution of the main parameters is investigated and evaluated. The numerical simulation and experimental evaluation are designed to verify the performance of the proposed method. The results show that the pose estimation error is in line with the numerical prediction, achieving the requirements of cutting-head pose estimation in underground roadway construction in the coal mine.","citedby-count":"20","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030867","afid":"60030867","affilname":"Xi'an University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028355","afid":"60028355","affilname":"Liverpool John Moores University","affiliation-city":"Liverpool","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/121849977","afid":"121849977","affilname":"Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Mine Electromechanical Equipment Intelligent Monitoring","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206587271","authid":"57206587271","orcid":"0000-0001-6191-3725","authname":"Yang W.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Wenjuan","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030867"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"121849977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57212679634","authid":"57212679634","authname":"Zhang X.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xuhui","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030867"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"121849977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55723497500","authid":"55723497500","authname":"Ma H.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Hongwei","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030867"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"121849977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12447116800","authid":"12447116800","authname":"Zhang G.M.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Guang Ming","initials":"G.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028355"}]}],"authkeywords":"boom-type roadheader | infrared LEDs | pose estimation | total accuracy error | underground camera model | Vision measurement","article-number":"8664647","source-id":"21100374601","fund-no":"2017-327","fund-sponsor":"Jilin Province Key R&amp;D Plan Project","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063772527"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063772527?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85063772527&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85063772527&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063772527","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85063772527","eid":"2-s2.0-85063772527","dc:title":"Concept of a visualization method for Earth's gravity field on plain maps","dc:creator":"Boyarchuk M.A.","prism:publicationName":"Scientific Visualization","prism:eIssn":"20793537","prism:volume":"11","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"70-79","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","prism:doi":"10.26583/sv.11.1.06","dc:description":"Currently in the study of Earth's physical fields vector field components are represented as separate scalar fields.

Based on the analysis of existing geophysical field representation methods, a new method of Earth physical vector fields' visualization that allows for simultaneous visualization for all components of a three dimensional vector on a plane map is presented. Application of quaternions for representation and visualization of vector fields is a distinctive feature of this method, which allows for an effective way for coor-dinate system transformations, finding of a resultant field and interpolation. A ruleset for converting quaternions' components into color system coordinates is described as well as an example of vector components restoration from color image. Also, an illustrating experiment is presented. Described visualization method can be used in GIS for more complete and de-tailed representation of Earth's physical fields.
