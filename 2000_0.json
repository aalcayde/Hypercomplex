The concept of a profile map is introduced for the data acquired by light striping so that disparity maps and laser scanned data can be processed consistently as real valued images on parametric domains. An iterative parametric point (IPP) algorithm is proposed for the simultaneous registration of multiple maps acquired from different viewpoints without known corresponding points when an initial registration is available. At each iteration, the corresponding points are determined directly on the parametric domains and the registration parameters are updated so that the mean of the squares of weighted distances between compatible corresponding points is minimized. Adaptive weighting is applied to the direction of the surface normal and to the distance between corresponding points, and the precision of the measuring is also incorporated into the weighting images. Edge areas are given less weight and the interpolation errors are leveled out in smooth areas for higher accuracy. The maps are registered hierarchically from low to high resolution for better convergence and shorter computing time. The IPP algorithm is developed further for refining the calibration of the light striping system. The calibration includes a projective transformation between the image plane of the camera and the plane of the laser sheet, and the direction of the scanning with respect to the plane of the laser sheet. The proposed method is based on matching multiple profile maps registered previously according to an approximate calibration. The registration and calibration parameters can be refined simultaneously, but this requires a close initial estimate and rather complex object geometry. It is also possible to adjust several calibrations at the same time if the registration is known exactly. The modeling of multiple registered maps includes techniques for merging compatible overlapping planar patches of different maps and tracing the borders of the merged patches on multiple domains. A technique is developed for the initial estimation of the parameters of a cylinder based on the cross product of non-parallel surface normals and on the intersection of a fan of planes. The propagation of measurement and calibration errors to the registration parameters and to the modeled maps is analyzed carefully for two combined registration and modeling strategies when the object consists of planar patches. In the first strategy, the maps are registered simultaneously and the model computed afterwards while in the second one, the maps are registered sequentially against the model reconstructed up till then. The analysis is performed for various distance images that can be used in the registration including the Levenberg-Marquardt method and the method of unit quaternions to update the registration parameters. The algorithms are formulated using image algebra and implemented efficiently using MATLAB software. Thorough testing with synthetic and real maps demonstrates the performance of the matching and modeling algorithms and illustrates the precision given by the two strategies. A comparison proves the superiority of the IPP algorithm to the iterative closest point algorithm as regards the accuracy, pull-in range, and computing time needed to update the corresponding points.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60103653","afid":"60103653","affilname":"Aalto University","affiliation-city":"Espoo","affiliation-country":"Finland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603028652","authid":"6603028652","authname":"Jokinen O.","surname":"Jokinen","given-name":"Olli","initials":"O.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60103653"}]}],"authkeywords":"3-D maps | Border tracing | Error propagation | Image algebra | Light striping | Quadric fitting | Registration | Segmentation | Self-calibration | Stereo vision","source-id":"18085","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0034443596"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0034443596?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0034443596&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0034443596&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0034443596","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0034443596","eid":"2-s2.0-0034443596","dc:title":"A normalized color difference edge detector based on quaternion representation","dc:creator":"Cai C.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","prism:volume":"2","prism:pageRange":"816-819","prism:coverDate":"2000-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2000","dc:description":"This paper presents the quaternion color difference edge detector, a new approach to detection of edges in color images.

The algorithm takes as input an arbitrary number of partially overlapping images, an adjacency map relating the images, initial estimates of the rotations relating each image to a specified base image, and approximate internal calibration information for the camera. The algorithm's output is a rotation relating each image to the base image, and revised estimates of the camera's internal parameters. Our algorithm is novel in the following respects. First, it requires no user input. (Our image capture instrumentation provides both an adjacency map for the mosaic, and an initial rotation estimate for each image.) Second, it optimizes an objective function based on a global correlation of overlapping image regions. Third, our representation of rotations significantly increases the accuracy of the optimization. Finally, our representation and use of adjacency information guarantees globally consistent rotation estimates. The algorithm has proved effective on a collection of nearly four thousand images acquired from more than eighty distinct optical centers. The experimental results demonstrate that the described global optimization strategy is superior to non-global aggregation of pair-wise correlation terms, and that it successfully generates high-quality mosaics despite significant error in initial rotation estimates.","citedby-count":"54","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006320","afid":"60006320","affilname":"MIT Computer Science &amp; Artificial Intelligence Laboratory","affiliation-city":"Cambridge","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602430833","authid":"6602430833","authname":"Coorg S.","surname":"Coorg","given-name":"Satyan","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006320"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003429722","authid":"7003429722","authname":"Teller S.","surname":"Teller","given-name":"Seth","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006320"}]}],"source-id":"72242","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0034194269"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0034194269?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0034194269&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0034194269&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0034194269","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0034194269","eid":"2-s2.0-0034194269","dc:title":"Angular reconstitution of the Staphylothermus marinus phosphoenolpyruvate synthase","dc:creator":"Li W.","prism:publicationName":"Microscopy Research and Technique","prism:issn":"1059910X","prism:volume":"49","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"233-244","prism:coverDate":"2000-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 May 2000","prism:doi":"10.1002/(SICI)1097-0029(20000501)49:3<233::AID-JEMT3>3.0.CO;2-W","dc:description":"The processes of single particle electron crystallography and three- dimensional angular reconstitution are applied to digital cryoelectron images of a macromolecular complex, the Staphylothermus marinus phosphoenolpyruvate synthase.

The authors introduce a new class of filter based on convolution with hypercomplex masks, and present three colour edge detecting filters inspired by the Prewitt, Sobel and Kirsch filters. These filters, when applied to a colour image, produce an almost greyscale image with colour edges where the original image had a sharp change of colour. They rely on a three-space rotation about the grey line of RGB space, implemented with the rotation operator R[ ]R-1 where A is a quaternion and R-1 is its inverse. Pixels of similar colour corresponding to opposing positions in the filter masks cancel to give a grey or monochromatic result, while pixels of different colour are differenced in a vector sense to give coloured edge pixels. The linearity of the new filters is discussed and the paper concludes with a discussion of the impulse response of a hypercomplex filter. © IEE, 2000.","citedby-count":"125","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012197","afid":"60012197","affilname":"University of Reading","affiliation-city":"Reading","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003346836","authid":"7003346836","authname":"Sangwine S.","surname":"Sangwine","given-name":"S.

In this paper we present a colour edge detection procedure designed to find edges between homogeneous regions of particular colours. Initially the three-dimensional RGB colour space is modelled as the imaginary subspace of a four-dimensional, hypercomplex space. A hypercomplex filter is then used to highlight edges between a region of colour C1 to a region of colour C2. A 4-D, thresholding criterion is derived to identify the image pixels belonging to these edges. We demonstrate that this procedure can successfully find particular coloured edges in both synthetic and natural images.","citedby-count":"32","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012197","afid":"60012197","affilname":"University of Reading","affiliation-city":"Reading","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211892861","authid":"57211892861","authname":"Evans C.","surname":"Evans","given-name":"Carolyn J.","initials":"C.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012197"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003346836","authid":"7003346836","authname":"Sangwine S.","surname":"Sangwine","given-name":"Stephen J.","initials":"S.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012197"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603651371","authid":"6603651371","authname":"Ell T.","surname":"Ell","given-name":"Todd A.","initials":"T.A."}],"article-number":"7075271","source-id":"21100204301","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85086492841"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85086492841?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85086492841&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85086492841&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85086492841","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85086492841","eid":"2-s2.0-85086492841","dc:title":"Kalman filtering to radar aided sdins with attitude quaternion parametrization","dc:creator":"Vathsal S.","prism:publicationName":"AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference and Exhibit","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781563479786"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2000-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2000","prism:doi":"10.2514/6.2000-4466","dc:description":"This paper presents the computer simulation validation of a hybrid navigation system of a flight vehicle externally aided by a Tracking Radar.

The accelerometer and gyro drift rate bias are estimated from the output of the filter. Colored measurement noise model of radar and attitude quaternion parametrization for the SDINS error model are used in this developement.

We demonstrate that to achieve coordinate frame independent results, (i) Rotations should be represented by quaternions or local rotation parameters, not angles, and (ii) the translation vector describing the camera/ scene motion should be represented in scene 3D coordinates, not camera 3D coordinates, two representations which are normally treated as interchangeable. The algorithm allows 3D point and line features to be reconstructed. Implementation is via the efficient recursive partitioning algorithm common in photogrammetry.

In the domain of real error, it is shown how optimal estimation based on prior knowledge can be derived. Assuming small Gaussian error, the estimation variance and bias are derived. Minimum bias and minimum variance are shown to be contradictory experimental design objectives. The analytical continuation of spectral estimation is constructed in an optimal manner. An important property of spectral estimation is that it is phase invariant. Hence, hypercomplex data storage is unnecessary. It is shown that, under reasonable assumptions, spectral estimation is unbiased in the context of complex error and its variance is reduced because the modulus of the whole signal is used. Because of phase invariance, the labor of phasing and any error due to imperfect phase can be avoided. A comparison of spectral estimation with nonlinear least squares (NLS) estimation is made analytically and with numerical examples. Compared to conventional sampling for NLS estimation, spectral estimation would typically provide estimation values of comparable precision in one-quarter to one-tenth of the spectrometer time when S/N is high. When S/N is low, the time saved can be used for signal averaging at the sampled points to give better precision. NLS typically provides one estimate at a time, whereas spectral estimation is inherently parallel. The frequency dimensions of conventional nD FT NMR may be denoted D1,D2, etc. As an extension of nD FT NMR, one can view spectral estimation of NMR relaxation as an extension into the zeroth dimension. In nD NMR, the information content of a spectrum can be extracted as a set of n-tuples (ω1,. . . ωn), corresponding to the peak maxima. Spectral estimation of NMR relaxation allows this information content to be extended to a set of (n + 1)-tuples (λ, ω1,. . . ωn), where λ is the relaxation rate. © 2000 Academic Press.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018491","afid":"60018491","affilname":"Simon Fraser University","affiliation-city":"Burnaby","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603089740","authid":"6603089740","authname":"Naugler D.","surname":"Naugler","given-name":"David G.","initials":"D.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018491"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005542261","authid":"7005542261","authname":"Cushley R.","surname":"Cushley","given-name":"Robert J.","initials":"R.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018491"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018491"}]}],"authkeywords":"Analytical continuation | Gaussian error propagation | NMR relaxation | Nonlinear least squares | Spectral estimation","source-id":"28525","fund-acr":"NSERC","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0034463376"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0034463376?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0034463376&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0034463376&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1047847700943223"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0034463376","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0034463376","eid":"2-s2.0-0034463376","dc:title":"Quaternary organization of the Staphylothermus marinus phosphoenolpyruvate synthase: Angular reconstitution from cryoelectron micrographs with molecular modeling","dc:creator":"Li W.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Structural Biology","prism:issn":"10478477","prism:volume":"132","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"226-240","prism:coverDate":"2000-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2000","prism:doi":"10.1006/jsbi.2000.4322","pii":"S1047847700943223","dc:description":"Digital electron images of frozen-hydrated preparations of the 2.25-MDa Staphylothermus marinus phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (EC 2.7.9.2) have been analyzed by single-particle classification and averaging and iterative quaternion-based angular reconstitution. Contrast transfer function correction of micrographs obtained at different defocus values was used to improve the informational quality of the projection averages. Three-dimensional reconstructions were obtained to roughly 3-nm spatial resolution, in which the 24 identical subunits were arranged to form an octahedral complex, although the amino-terminal nucleotide-binding domain was not resolved. An atomic model of the subunit was generated by homology modeling using as the reference the known X-ray crystallographic structure of the related enzyme pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (EC 2.7.9.1) from Clostridium symbiosum (Protein Data Bank entry 1DIK). The S. marinus protein could be arranged into an assembly of 12 homodimers to match the three-dimensional reconstruction in terms of shape and size of the homodimers, as well as overall shape and size of the complex. The quaternary model indicated that active sites of three monomers were localized around cavities (or putative channels) centered at the threefold axes of rotational symmetry and that carboxyl-terminal alpha-helical segments of four monomers were localized at the fourfold axes of rotational symmetry where they could facilitate interdimer interaction. The quaternary arrangement also indicated numerous potential hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions at the interdimer interfaces that could contribute further to structural stability. © 2000 Academic Press.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016849","afid":"60016849","affilname":"University of Toronto","affiliation-city":"Toronto","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015881","afid":"60015881","affilname":"University of Guelph","affiliation-city":"Guelph","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"pubmed-id":"11243891","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36066119900","authid":"36066119900","authname":"Li W.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Wen","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015881"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005603129","authid":"7005603129","authname":"Ottensmeyer F.P.","surname":"Ottensmeyer","given-name":"F.

The object could be a model or a real object. It cost time and money. In recent years, computer-generated holograms have been investigated intensively because of their wide application range and their advantages in term of flexibility, accuracy, light weight and cost. In this paper, a new kind of fractal digital hologram is introduced. The fractal digital holograms are produced with the hyper-complex number model, the fractal hyper-texture model and the self-similar image model based on multi-scale Hurst parameters. The fractal digital holograms have been used in security holograms. In security hologram, the more complex the model is, the more security the holograms has. The results indicate that fractal digital holograms have a good prospect for application in security holograms.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025761","afid":"60025761","affilname":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403345988","authid":"7403345988","authname":"Cao H.","surname":"Cao","given-name":"Hanqiang","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402633110","authid":"7402633110","authname":"Zhu G.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Guangxi","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7406074423","authid":"7406074423","authname":"Zhu Y.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Yaoting","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15041331900","authid":"15041331900","authname":"Zhang Z.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Zhaoqun","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55470378500","authid":"55470378500","authname":"Cao Y.","surname":"Cao","given-name":"Yulin","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36795949000","authid":"36795949000","authname":"Ge H.","surname":"Ge","given-name":"Hongwei","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7501712932","authid":"7501712932","authname":"Li X.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Xuan","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]}],"source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
