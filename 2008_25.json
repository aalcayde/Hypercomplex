In contrast to other visual servo controllers, this formulation uses a quaternion representation of the rotation. By doing so, potential singularities introduced by the rotational matrix representation can be avoided, which is usually a very desirable property in, for example, aerospace applications such as for visual control of satellites, helicopters, etc. The movement of the camera and the image processing were performed using a simulation of the real environment. This testing environment was developed in Matlab-Simulink and it allowed us to test the controller regardeless of the mechanism in which the camera was moved and the underlying controller that was needed for this movement. The final controller was tested using yet another simulation program provided by Kawasaki Japan for the UX150 industrial robot. The setup for testing and the results of the simulations are presented in this paper.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006173","afid":"60006173","affilname":"University of Missouri","affiliation-city":"Columbia","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006804246","authid":"7006804246","authname":"Koenig T.","surname":"Koenig","given-name":"T.","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006173"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701775683","authid":"6701775683","authname":"De Souza G.N.","surname":"De Souza","given-name":"G.

Happer, Ann. Phys. (N.Y.) 48, 579 (1968)]. As Happer pointed out, such an expansion in irreducible spherical tensor operators readily lends itself to the methods of Racah algebra, a feature we exploit to simplify the calculus of rotation matrix products. Working with a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient expansion [W. Happer, ibid. cit.; M.S. Marinov, Yad. Fiz. 5, 943 (1967)] of the corresponding rotation matrices [image omitted], and closure relations for these (2J + 1)-dimensional irreducible representations of the rotation group, we state, and prove for the first time, simple recoupling coefficient expansions for rotation matrix products. With an eye towards applications in NMR, where multiple rotations in spin or coordinate space often require the efficient evaluation of such rotation matrix products, we focus on expansions defining the matrices representing the result of two or three consecutive rotations. We show that the coefficients of these expansions are defined by 6 - j symbols and bipolar spherical harmonics (two rotations), or by 9 - j symbols and tripolar spherical harmonics (three rotations). We show that these recoupling coefficient expansions, in conjunction with Racah algebra, are the cornerstone of an unusually simple and direct method of (1) proving the Euler-Rodrigues (quaternion) parameter [image omitted] composition rules for two and three consecutive rotations and (2) constructing rotational invariants expressed in Weyl-invariant form. These methods are distinguished by their independence on the usual algebraic approaches, either those of operator algebra, or ordinary algebra. © 2008 Taylor and Francis.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024776","afid":"60024776","affilname":"University of Lethbridge","affiliation-city":"Lethbridge","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003688095","authid":"7003688095","authname":"Siminovitch D.J.","surname":"Siminovitch","given-name":"David J.","initials":"D.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024776"}]}],"authkeywords":"Coupling coefficients | Matrix products | Multipolar harmonics | Racah algebra | Rotation matrices","source-id":"26990","fund-acr":"NSERC","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/57449086021"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/57449086021?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=57449086021&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=57449086021&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/57449086021","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:57449086021","eid":"2-s2.0-57449086021","dc:title":"Doubled random-phase encryption based on discrete quaternion fourier-transforms","dc:creator":"Gai Q.","prism:publicationName":"Wuli Xuebao/Acta Physica Sinica","prism:issn":"10003290","prism:volume":"57","prism:issueIdentifier":"11","prism:pageRange":"6955-6961","prism:coverDate":"2008-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2008","dc:description":"In this paper, a new method for color-image encryption using discrete quaternion fourier-transforms (DQFT) combined with doubled random-phase encryption as used in the optical implementation is proposed, by which color images can be processed as a whole, rather than as separated color components in three channels, so that the complexity of the encryption system can be effectively reduced without any reduction in its security.

To estimate SINS errors with uncertain measurement noise, an adaptive extended Kalman filtering method is proposed. In the adaptive filtering method, the components of a measurement vector are processed serially, and the measurement noise covariance matrix is estimated on-line.

In computer vision, many models have been proposed to simulate the behavior of eyes such as SaliencyToolBox (STB), Neuromorphic Vision Toolkit (NVT) and etc., but they demand high computational cost and their remarkable results mostly rely on the choice of parameters. Recently a simple and fast approach based on Fourier transform called spectral residual (SR) was proposed, which used SR of the amplitude spectrum to obtain the saliency map. The results are good, but the reason is questionable. In this paper, we propose it is the phase spectrum, not the amplitude spectrum, of the Fourier transform that is the key in obtaining the location of salient areas. We provide some examples to show that PFT can get better results in comparison with SR and requires less computational complexity as well. Furthermore, PFT can be easily extended from a two-dimensional Fourier transform to a Quaternion Fourier Transform (QFT) if the value of each pixel is represented as a quaternion composed of intensity, color and motion feature. The added motion dimension allows the phase spectrum to represent spatio-temporal saliency in order to engage in attention selection for videos as well as images. Extensive tests of videos, natural images and psychological patterns show that the proposed method is more effective than other models. Moreover, it is very robust against white-colored noise and meets the real-time requirements, which has great potentials in engineering applications. ©2008 IEEE.","citedby-count":"747","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009860","afid":"60009860","affilname":"Fudan University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23090530600","authid":"23090530600","authname":"Guo C.","surname":"Guo","given-name":"Chenlei","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009860"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36523253300","authid":"36523253300","authname":"Ma Q.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Qi","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009860"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13606649200","authid":"13606649200","authname":"Zhang L.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Liming","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009860"}]}],"article-number":"4587715","source-id":"12100157103","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/51849136878"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/51849136878?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=51849136878&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=51849136878&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/51849136878","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:51849136878","eid":"2-s2.0-51849136878","dc:title":"Parameter estimation of vector-sensor array in colored noise with Quaternion-MUSIC","dc:creator":"Zhang K.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - 1st International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, CISP 2008","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780769531199"}],"prism:volume":"5","prism:pageRange":"483-487","prism:coverDate":"2008-09-22","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2008","prism:doi":"10.1109/CISP.2008.289","dc:description":"This paper addresses the problem of estimating direction of arrival (DOA) and polarization parameters for vector-sensor array in MA noise based on quaternion. First, the computation method of right eigenvalue decomposition of quaternion matrix (REVDQ) is introduced in detail. Then, duplicate autocorrelation function (that's auto-correlation function of auto-correlation function) of quaternion signal is defined, which can not only express signal parameters but also restrain MA noise. Finally, Toeplitz matrix based on duplicate auto-correlation function is constructed, and right eigenvalue decomposition of the Toeplitz matrix is used to part signal subspace and noise subspace. Thus, signal parameters are estimated with Quaternion-MUSIC (Q-MUSIC) taking advantage of orthogonality between signal subspace and noise subspace. Some simulations illustrate our idea. © 2008 IEEE.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60069733","afid":"60069733","affilname":"Juin University","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021666","afid":"60021666","affilname":"Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404451254","authid":"7404451254","authname":"Zhang K.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Kunlei","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069733"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16553752800","authid":"16553752800","authname":"Wang S.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Shuxun","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069733"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56510425800","authid":"56510425800","authname":"Wang F.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Fei","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55728845300","authid":"55728845300","authname":"Han J.","surname":"Han","given-name":"Jianguo","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069733"}]}],"article-number":"4566875","source-id":"18500166600","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/51849113421"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/51849113421?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=51849113421&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=51849113421&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/51849113421","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:51849113421","eid":"2-s2.0-51849113421","dc:title":"A subpixel color image registration algorithm using quaternion phase-only correlation","dc:creator":"Feng W.","prism:publicationName":"ICALIP 2008 - 2008 International Conference on Audio, Language and Image Processing, Proceedings","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781424417230"}],"prism:pageRange":"1045-1049","prism:coverDate":"2008-09-22","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2008","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICALIP.2008.4590016","dc:description":"In this paper, we extend the conventional phase-only correlation (POC) technique to the quaternion field (QPOC) and propose a subpixel color image registration algorithm based on the QPOC. Due to mathematical limitations, traditional POC-based registration algorithms can only be applied to grayscale images or at most complex images. A color image must be first converted to a grayscale one before performing the POC, during which the chrominance information has been wasted. The proposed algorithm not only can naturally make full use of the luminance as well as the chrominance information in color images, but also can directly estimate the subpixel translational shift from the 2D data array of the QPOC function.

The orientation of manipulator is represented by the unit quaternion, which avoids singularities associated with three-parameter representation. By employing the adaptive Jacobian scheme, neural networks, and backstepping technique, the torque controller is obtained which is demonstrated to be stable by the Lyapunov approach. The adaptive updating laws for controller parameters are derived by the projection method, and the tracking error can be reduced as small as desired. The favorable features of the proposed controller lie in that: (1) the uncertainty in manipulator kinematics is taken into account; (2) the unit quaternion is used to represent the end-effector orientation; (3) the \"linearity-in-parameters\" assumption for the uncertain terms in dynamics of manipulators is no longer necessary; (4) effects of external disturbances are also considered in the controller design. Finally, the satisfactory performance of the proposed approach is illustrated by simulation results on a PUMA 560 robot. ©2008 IEEE.","citedby-count":"17","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027363","afid":"60027363","affilname":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018486","afid":"60018486","affilname":"Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403337296","authid":"7403337296","authname":"Cheng L.","surname":"Cheng","given-name":"Long","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018486"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13102644800","authid":"13102644800","authname":"Hou Z.","surname":"Hou","given-name":"Zeng Guang","initials":"Z.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018486"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14034568900","authid":"14034568900","authname":"Tan M.","surname":"Tan","given-name":"Min","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018486"}]}],"article-number":"4543725","source-id":"25456","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
