A signal processing approach is proposed to deal with traffic surveillance. Traffic structures are depicted using directed graph models. The relationship among different traffic direction signals are represented through using quaternion numbers instead of individual representation of one particular direction. Multi- granularity local density-based method is adopted to perform anomaly detection for separate entry direction distribution (EDD) signals. Complex traffic signals are subsequently examined by exploring the relationship expressed with quaternion numbers. In such way, the anomaly detection complexity is reduced. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve high detection rate. The overall average DSR of both AM and PM sessions is about 97.83%, which is better than the previous algorithm (96.67%) in the literature.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014347","afid":"60014347","affilname":"Hong Kong Baptist University","affiliation-city":null,"affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006541","afid":"60006541","affilname":"The University of Hong Kong","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001881","afid":"60001881","affilname":"The University of Sheffield","affiliation-city":"Sheffield","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57196336268","authid":"57196336268","authname":"Wang L.L.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Li Li","initials":"L.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014347"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56735780700","authid":"56735780700","authname":"Ngan H.Y.T.","surname":"Ngan","given-name":"Henry Y.T.","initials":"H.Y.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014347"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56645219600","authid":"56645219600","authname":"Liu W.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001881"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003473369","authid":"7003473369","authname":"Yung N.H.C.","surname":"Yung","given-name":"Nelson H.C.","initials":"N.H.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006541"}]}],"authkeywords":"Anomaly detection | density based method | directed graph | quaternion | traffic data | traffic surveillance","article-number":"7797009","source-id":"21100793698","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85011309740"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85011309740?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85011309740&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85011309740&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85011309740","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85011309740","eid":"2-s2.0-85011309740","dc:title":"Quaternionic upsampling: Hyperspherical techniques for 6 DoF pose tracking","dc:creator":"Busam B.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - 2016 4th International Conference on 3D Vision, 3DV 2016","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781509054077"}],"prism:pageRange":"629-638","prism:coverDate":"2016-12-15","prism:coverDisplayDate":"15 December 2016","prism:doi":"10.1109/3DV.2016.71","dc:description":"Fast real-time tracking is an integral component of modern 3D computer vision pipelines. Despite their advantages in accuracy and reliability, optical trackers suffer from limited acquisition rates depending either on intrinsic sensor capabilities or physical limitations such as exposure time. Moreover, data transmission and image processing produce latency in the pose stream. We introduce quaternionic upsampling to overcome these problems. The technique models the pose parameters as points on multidimensional hyperspheres in (dual) quaternion space. In order to upsample the pose stream, we present several methods to sample points on geodesics and piecewise continuous curves on these manifolds and compare them regarding accuracy and computation efficiency. With the unified approach of quaternionic upsampling, both interpolation and extrapolation in pose space can be done by continuous linear variation of only one sampling parameter. Since the method can be implemented rather efficiently, pose rates of over 4 kHz and future pose predictions with an accuracy of 128 μm and 0.5° are possible in real-time. The method does not depend on a special tracking algorithm and can thus be used for any arbitrary 3 DoF or 6 DoF rotation or pose tracking system.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60116236","afid":"60116236","affilname":"FRAMOS GmbH","affiliation-city":"Taufkirchen","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019722","afid":"60019722","affilname":"Technische Universität München","affiliation-city":"Munich","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005248","afid":"60005248","affilname":"Johns Hopkins University","affiliation-city":"Baltimore","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57015641800","authid":"57015641800","authname":"Busam B.","surname":"Busam","given-name":"Benjamin","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019722"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60116236"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56340644100","authid":"56340644100","authname":"Esposito M.","surname":"Esposito","given-name":"Marco","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019722"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26655593100","authid":"26655593100","authname":"Frisch B.","surname":"Frisch","given-name":"Benjamin","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019722"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003458998","authid":"7003458998","authname":"Navab N.","surname":"Navab","given-name":"Nassir","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019722"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005248"}]}],"authkeywords":"6 DoF Pose Tracking | Dead Reckoning | Dual Quaternions | Extrapolation | Interpolation | Pose Stream Synchronization","article-number":"7785139","source-id":"21100793805","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85010377783"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85010377783?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85010377783&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85010377783&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85010377783","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85010377783","eid":"2-s2.0-85010377783","dc:title":"Whole-body Modeling and Hierarchical Control of Humanoid Robot Based on Dual Quaternion Algebra","dc:creator":"Fonseca M.D.P.A.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - 13th Latin American Robotics Symposium and 4th Brazilian Symposium on Robotics, LARS/SBR 2016","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781509036561"}],"prism:pageRange":"293-298","prism:coverDate":"2016-12-14","prism:coverDisplayDate":"14 December 2016","prism:doi":"10.1109/LARS-SBR.2016.24","dc:description":"This paper presents a whole-body pose control of a mobile manipulator using a cascade scheme with two control loops. In the outer loop there is a nonlinear controller based on dual-quaternion feedback linearization - whose reference is a unit dual quaternion representing the desired end effector's pose - that acts as a dynamic trajectory generator and generates input signals for both nonholonomic mobile base and manipulator arm, the inner loop uses the input signals generated by the outer-loop as reference for an input-output linearizing controller that explicitly takes into account the nonholonomic constraints of the mobile base. Experimental results on a real platform are performed in order to compare the proposed scheme to a traditional whole-body kinematic controller using the pseudoinverse of the Jacobian matrix.

Nevertheless, bias, drift, and noise existing in sensor signals are difficult to eliminate, and accurate movement trajectory information is still needed to achieve flexible interaction application. This paper presents micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) motion sensor information processing algorithms designed on a gesture interaction system which integrates multiple low-cost MEMS motion sensors with ZigBee wireless technology to support embodied communication while acting together with machines. Sensor signal processing systems mainly solve noise removal, signal smoothing, gravity influence separation, coordinate system conversion, and position information retrieval. The attitude information which is an important movement parameter and required by position estimation is calculated with a quaternion-based extended Kalman filter (EKF). The effectiveness of the movement information retrieval of this gesture interface is verified by experiments and test analysis, both in static and moving cases. In the end, related applications of the described sensor information processing are discussed.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026422","afid":"60026422","affilname":"Universitat fur Musik und darstellende Kunst Wien","affiliation-city":"Vienna","affiliation-country":"Austria"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56803200300","authid":"56803200300","authname":"Ling Y.","surname":"Ling","given-name":"Yin","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026422"}]}],"source-id":"21100463872","fund-acr":"FP7","fund-no":"605867","fund-sponsor":"Seventh Framework Programme","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85010281244"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85010281244?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85010281244&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85010281244&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85010281244","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85010281244","eid":"2-s2.0-85010281244","dc:title":"Spinning missile attitude estimation system based on the sun vector and MEMS","dc:creator":"Xu G.Y.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - 2016 6th International Conference on Instrumentation and Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control, IMCCC 2016","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781509011957"}],"prism:pageRange":"394-399","prism:coverDate":"2016-12-05","prism:coverDisplayDate":"5 December 2016","prism:doi":"10.1109/IMCCC.2016.215","dc:description":"In this paper, a new method of estimating the attitude to spinning missile was proposed. The author designed the method of using sun vector to correct the gyro bias of MEMS sensor and using the Kalman filter algorithm to estimate the spinning missile attitude. According to the nature of spinning missile, this paper designed a special sun sensor that is used to measure the sun vector replaced the commonly used in MEMS sensor of accelerometer and magnetometer to correct the gyro bias of MEMS sensor. The sun vector measuring device comprises the transparent shell, the photocell array, the real-time clock and the controller. When the sun shines through the transparent shell illuminates the photocell array, the photocell array can convert the solar energy into the electric potential signal. According to the size of the solar energy and the angle of the photocell laying, combining with the accurate time provided by the real time clock, the sun vector of this time is obtained through the main controller processes data. The Kalman filer state equation and observation equation established by the quaternion differential equation is used to estimate the spinning missile attitude. The simulation results show that this method can obtain the higher accuracy attitude angle of spinning missile.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018326","afid":"60018326","affilname":"Shenyang Aerospace University","affiliation-city":"Shenyang","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/17347022200","authid":"17347022200","authname":"Xu G.Y.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Guang Yan","initials":"G.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018326"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190878670","authid":"57190878670","authname":"Liao P.C.","surname":"Liao","given-name":"Pei Chong","initials":"P.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018326"}]}],"authkeywords":"Kalman filter | Quaternion | Spinning missile | Sun vector","article-number":"7774807","source-id":"21100792702","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84994257449"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84994257449?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84994257449&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84994257449&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S092523121630827X"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84994257449","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84994257449","eid":"2-s2.0-84994257449","dc:title":"Color image classification via quaternion principal component analysis network","dc:creator":"Zeng R.","prism:publicationName":"Neurocomputing","prism:issn":"09252312","prism:eIssn":"18728286","prism:volume":"216","prism:pageRange":"416-428","prism:coverDate":"2016-12-05","prism:coverDisplayDate":"5 December 2016","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.neucom.2016.08.006","pii":"S092523121630827X","dc:description":"The principal component analysis network (PCANet), which is one of the recently proposed deep learning architectures, achieves the state-of-the-art classification accuracy in various datasets and reveals a simple baseline for deep learning networks. However, the performance of PCANet may be degraded when dealing with color images due to the fact that the architecture of PCANet cannot properly utilize the spatial relationship between each color channel in three dimensional color image. In this paper, a quaternion principal component analysis network (QPCANet), which extends PCANet by using quaternion theory, is proposed for color image classification. Compared to PCANet, the proposed QPCANet takes into account the spatial distribution information of RGB channels in color images and ensures larger amount of intra-class invariance by using quaternion domain representation for color images. Experiments conducted on different color image datasets such as UC Merced Land Use, Georgia Tech face, CURet and Caltech-101 have revealed that the proposed QPCANet generally achieves higher classification accuracy than PCANet in color image classification task. The experimental results also verify that QPCANet has much better rotation invariance than PCANet when color image dataset contains lots of rotation information and demonstrate even a simple one-layer QPCANet may obtain satisfactory accuracy when compared with two-layer PCANet.","citedby-count":"56","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60128870","afid":"60128870","affilname":"Key Laboratory of Computer Network and Information Integration, Ministry of Education","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60105589","afid":"60105589","affilname":"Laboratoire Traitement du Signal et de l'Image","affiliation-city":"Rennes","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143","afid":"60064143","affilname":"Nanjing University of Information Science &amp;

Our method utilizes a network of miniaturized wireless inertial sensors, coupled with a suite of real-time analysis algorithms and can operate in any unconstrained environment. First, we adopt a modified computationally efficient, highly accurate, and near real-time gradient descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative in order to obtain the 3D orientation of each of the six segments. Second, by utilizing the foot sensor, we successfully detect the stance phase of the human gait cycle, which allows us to obtain drift-free velocity and the 3D position of the left and right feet during functional phases of a gait cycle. Third, by setting the foot segment as the root node we calculate the 3D orientation and position of the other two segments as well as the left and right ankle, knee, and hip joints. We then employ a customized kinematic model adjustment technique to ensure that the motion is coherent with human biomechanical behavior of the leg. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) and significant difference test results (P) were used to quantify the relationship between the calculated and measured movements for all joints in the sagittal plane. The correlation between the calculated and the reference was found to have similar trends for all six joints (r > 0.94, p < 0.005).","citedby-count":"43","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60086943","afid":"60086943","affilname":"VICOMTech","affiliation-city":"Donostia-San Sebastian","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025059","afid":"60025059","affilname":"Dublin City University","affiliation-city":"Dublin","affiliation-country":"Ireland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12790106500","authid":"12790106500","authname":"Ahmadi A.","surname":"Ahmadi","given-name":"Amin","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025059"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35791025500","authid":"35791025500","authname":"Destelle F.","surname":"Destelle","given-name":"François","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025059"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13607585100","authid":"13607585100","authname":"Unzueta L.","surname":"Unzueta","given-name":"Luis","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60086943"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9246396700","authid":"9246396700","authname":"Monaghan D.","surname":"Monaghan","given-name":"David S.","initials":"D.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025059"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56378353900","authid":"56378353900","authname":"Linaza M.","surname":"Linaza","given-name":"Maria Teresa","initials":"M.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60086943"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16245608800","authid":"16245608800","authname":"Moran K.","surname":"Moran","given-name":"Kieran","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025059"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7103192405","authid":"7103192405","authname":"O'Connor N.","surname":"O'Connor","given-name":"Noel E.","initials":"N.E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025059"}]}],"authkeywords":"3D trajectory | Human gait | Kinematic model | Wearable inertial sensors","article-number":"7516603","source-id":"15047","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85002246064"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85002246064?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85002246064&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85002246064&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85002246064","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85002246064","eid":"2-s2.0-85002246064","dc:title":"Estimation of DOA and polarization parameters with 2-level nested vector-sensor array based on quaternion model","dc:creator":"Zhao J.","prism:publicationName":"Transactions of Tianjin University","prism:issn":"10064982","prism:eIssn":"19958196","prism:volume":"22","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"583-589","prism:coverDate":"2016-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 December 2016","prism:doi":"10.1007/s12209-016-2735-6","dc:description":"The quaternion coherence problem exists in the data model of the conventional dimensional reduced quaternion estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques(DRQ-ESPRIT), and DRQ-ESPRIT would lose degrees of freedom(DOFs)when it is used to implement the spatial smooth operation.

First, the quaternion Fourier-Mellin transform is used to calculate the geometric hash to eliminate the influence of geometric distortions. Then, a new quaternion image construction method, which combines advantages of both color and structural features, is proposed to implement the quaternion Fourier transform to calculate the image feature hash to locate the tampered regions. The objective is to provide a reasonably short image hashing with good performance, i.e., being perceptually robust against various content-preserving attacks while capable of detecting and locating almost all types of tampering. Furthermore, an adaptive tampering localization algorithm is proposed based on clustering analysis to improve the detection accuracy.

Experimental results show that the proposed model can achieve high performance in terms of the average AUC and F-measure evaluation metrics and outperform state-of-the-art baselines.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029943","afid":"60029943","affilname":"Henan Normal University","affiliation-city":"Xinxiang","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/119208291","afid":"119208291","affilname":"Engineering Lab of Intelligence Business &amp; Internet of Things","affiliation-city":"Henan Province","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56923956400","authid":"56923956400","authname":"Liu S.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Shangwang","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029943"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"119208291"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191291348","authid":"57191291348","authname":"Hu J.","surname":"Hu","given-name":"Jianlan","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029943"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"119208291"}]}],"authkeywords":"Contrast function | Frequency domain analysis | HFT | Saliency detection | Spatial information","source-id":"25627","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"15A520080","fund-sponsor":"Henan Normal University","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84983509351"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84983509351?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84983509351&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84983509351&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1051200416300914"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84983509351","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84983509351","eid":"2-s2.0-84983509351","dc:title":"Improved Kalman-based attitude estimation framework for UAVs via an antenna array","dc:creator":"Cordeiro T.F.K.","prism:publicationName":"Digital Signal Processing: A Review Journal","prism:issn":"10512004","prism:volume":"59","prism:pageRange":"49-65","prism:coverDate":"2016-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 December 2016","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.dsp.2016.07.006","pii":"S1051200416300914","dc:description":"Accurate attitude estimation is crucial for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in order to facilitate automated activities such as landing or trajectory tracking. Recently antenna array based communication systems have been installed in UAVs. This array structure can also be applied for attitude estimation by computing the line-of-sight (LOS) path between the base station and UAV. In this paper, we propose a complete framework for attitude estimation by exploiting 3D LOS vector obtained from the antenna array system. We present all the steps to incorporate the estimated LOS vector into the TRIaxial Attitude Determination (TRIAD), QUaternion ESTimator (QUEST) and Kalman algorithms. As an additional contribution, the error covariance matrix of the LOS vector is analytically calculated by first finding the phase shift mean squared error using the known perturbation model from Singular Value Decomposition and assuming that the antenna array measured data error can be modeled as a circularly symmetric white noise. We evaluate five array configurations via Monte Carlo simulations. We show that array configurations that provide orthogonal components of the LOS vector achieve a better performance. The usage of more than three pairs of antennas to improve the estimation of the LOS vector is also proposed for low and intermediate signal-to-noise ratio regimes.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030040","afid":"60030040","affilname":"Technischen Universität Ilmenau","affiliation-city":"Ilmenau","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024989","afid":"60024989","affilname":"Universidade de Brasília","affiliation-city":"Brasilia","affiliation-country":"Brazil"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013983","afid":"60013983","affilname":"City University of Hong Kong","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009794","afid":"60009794","affilname":"Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS","affiliation-city":"Erlangen","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195512195","authid":"57195512195","orcid":"0000-0002-7264-6041","authname":"Cordeiro T.F.K.","surname":"Cordeiro","given-name":"Thiago Felippe K.","initials":"T.F.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024989"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024989"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24723435700","authid":"24723435700","authname":"da Costa J.P.C.L.","surname":"da Costa","given-name":"João Paulo C.L.","initials":"J.P.C.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024989"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030040"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009794"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221813900","authid":"57221813900","authname":"de Sousa R.T.","surname":"de Sousa","given-name":"Rafael Timóteo","initials":"R.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024989"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102300029","authid":"7102300029","authname":"So H.C.","surname":"So","given-name":"Hing Cheung","initials":"H.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013983"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005520454","authid":"7005520454","authname":"Borges G.A.","surname":"Borges","given-name":"Geovany A.","initials":"G.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024989"}]}],"authkeywords":"Antenna array | Attitude estimation | ESPRIT | Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) | Kalman filter","source-id":"24306","fund-acr":"CAPES","fund-no":"30/2014","fund-sponsor":"Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84974777639"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84974777639?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84974777639&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84974777639&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84974777639","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84974777639","eid":"2-s2.0-84974777639","dc:title":"Generalized spatial representation for digital modulation and its potential application","dc:creator":"Huan H.","prism:publicationName":"Science China Information Sciences","prism:issn":"1674733X","prism:volume":"59","prism:issueIdentifier":"12","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2016-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 December 2016","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11432-015-5493-5","dc:description":"Constellation mapping has provided a great convenience to measure the performance of digital signal modulation in Euclid space. However, traditional in-phase and quadrature (IQ) plane is difficult to express the frequency modulation scheme such as minimum shift keying (MSK) and the time domain modulation such as cyclic code shift keying (CCSK). How to represent the digital signal modulation visually through constellation mapping is an attractive problem. To address this issue, in this paper, the combined frequency and phase modulation are utilized to define a new kind of constellation mapping, where the phase and frequency are quantized to the same elements. The uniform geometric construction for combined phase and frequency modulation is redefined in the 3D cylindrical coordinate system based on frequency (f), in-phase component (I) and quadrature component (Q). In the new coordinates, the quadrature frequency-phase shift keying (QFPSK) is produced by the QPSK with dimensional rotation matrix and denoted by the reduced dual quaternion. Furthermore, the spatial extension from QFPSK to chirp cyclic shift keying (Chirp CSK) is analyzed with bandwidth efficiency and energy efficiency. At last, the QFPSK is combined with the 2D OFDM, yielding the image OFDM system. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of QFPSK in the proposed system with the time-varying wireless channel and frequency selective fading channel respectively.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016835","afid":"60016835","affilname":"Beijing Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001604","afid":"60001604","affilname":"Ministry of Education China","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36696438900","authid":"36696438900","authname":"Huan H.","surname":"Huan","given-name":"Hao","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001604"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57207167854","authid":"57207167854","authname":"Shi P.","surname":"Shi","given-name":"Pengfei","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189711558","authid":"57189711558","authname":"Yan X.","surname":"Yan","given-name":"Xiaodong","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102857080","authid":"7102857080","authname":"Tao R.","surname":"Tao","given-name":"Ran","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]}],"authkeywords":"chirp cyclic shift keying | image OFDM system | quadrature frequency-phase shift keying (QFPSK) | spatial constellation mapping | wireless communication","article-number":"122303","source-id":"19600161832","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963831159"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963831159?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84963831159&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84963831159&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963831159","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84963831159","eid":"2-s2.0-84963831159","dc:title":"Multi-modal Color Medical Image Fusion Using Quaternion Discrete Fourier Transform","dc:creator":"Nawaz Q.","prism:publicationName":"Sensing and Imaging","prism:issn":"15572064","prism:eIssn":"15572072","prism:volume":"17","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2016-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 December 2016","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11220-016-0131-x","dc:description":"Multimodal image fusion is a process of combining multiple images, generated by identical or diverse imaging modalities, to get precise inside information about the same body organ. In recent years, various multimodal image fusion algorithms have been proposed to fuse medical image. However, most of them focus on fusing grayscale images. This paper proposes a novel algorithm for the fusion of multimodal color medical images. The proposed algorithm divides source images into blocks, converts each RGB block into quaternion representation and transforms them from special domain to frequency domain by applying quaternion discrete Fourier transform. The fused coefficients are obtained by calculating and comparing contrast values of corresponding coefficients in transformed blocks. The resultant fused image is reconstructed by merging all the blocks after applying inverse quaternion discrete Fourier transform on each block. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed algorithm qualitatively outperforms many existing state-of-the-art multimodal image fusion algorithms.","citedby-count":"14","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020620","afid":"60020620","affilname":"Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194768812","authid":"57194768812","authname":"Nawaz Q.","surname":"Nawaz","given-name":"Qamar","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201773066","authid":"57201773066","authname":"Xiao B.","surname":"Xiao","given-name":"Bin","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188859988","authid":"57188859988","authname":"Hamid I.","surname":"Hamid","given-name":"Isma","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188847241","authid":"57188847241","authname":"Jiao D.","surname":"Jiao","given-name":"Du","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image fusion | Medical image fusion | Multi-modal image fusion | QDFT based image fusion","article-number":"7","source-id":"5100155104","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"cstc2014jcyjjq40001","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85014895730"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85014895730?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85014895730&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85014895730&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85014895730","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85014895730","eid":"2-s2.0-85014895730","dc:title":"Modeling of physiological tremor with quaternion variant of extreme learning machines","dc:creator":"Tatinati S.","prism:publicationName":"ACM International Conference Proceeding Series","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781450348195"}],"prism:pageRange":"255-258","prism:coverDate":"2016-11-26","prism:coverDisplayDate":"26 November 2016","prism:doi":"10.1145/3018009.3018053","dc:description":"Hand-held robotic surgical instruments are developed to acquire the maneuvered hand motion of the surgeon and then provide a control signal for real-time compensation of the physiological tremor in three-dimensional (3-D) space.

This paper proposes an improved method for float ambiguity estimation in real-time attitude determination using single-frequency Global Navigation Satellite System carrier phase measurements. The functional relationship between double-differenced phase observations and attitude quaternion is formulated to fully exploit all the available information of the multi-antenna geometry configuration. Considering the nonlinearity of the system, the unscented Kalman filter is developed to simultaneously estimate float ambiguities and attitude quaternions. The least-squares ambiguity decorrelation adjustment method is further used to fix the float solutions and modify the attitudes. A static ultra-short baseline (0.55 m) BeiDou test is carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Results show that the accuracy of float ambiguities is improved compared to conventional baseline-solving techniques and higher success rate and less Time-to-Fix are achieved for integer ambiguity resolution. In addition, the robustness to reduction of the number of available satellites is also demonstrated.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60102437","afid":"60102437","affilname":"China Academy of Space Technology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013789","afid":"60013789","affilname":"Beihang University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192545963","authid":"57192545963","authname":"Yang Y.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Ying","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102437"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36063557600","authid":"36063557600","authname":"Li Y.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Yong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102437"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192998123","authid":"57192998123","authname":"Chen P.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Pei","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013789"}]}],"authkeywords":"Float ambiguity | Multi-Antenna configuration | Real-time attitude determination | Unscented Kalman filter","article-number":"7752533","source-id":"21100789852","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85004140646"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85004140646?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85004140646&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85004140646&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85004140646","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85004140646","eid":"2-s2.0-85004140646","dc:title":"Iμmagnetometer based 3D indoor positioning for wheeled platforms in NLoS scenarios","dc:creator":"Hellmers H.","prism:publicationName":"2016 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation, IPIN 2016","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781509024254"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2016-11-14","prism:coverDisplayDate":"14 November 2016","prism:doi":"10.1109/IPIN.2016.7743655","dc:description":"In recent years the research on localization and navigation systems in GNSS-denied environments has been focused from both industry and research. Although many technologies based on e.g. UWB, WLAN, ultrasonic or infrared have been utilized, there is still no final solution for position and orientation determination in indoor areas. The fact, that applied signals in common approaches are influenced by fading and multipath inside buildings leads to restrictions on line-of-sight (LoS) conditions. In contrast, the ability of penetrating any kind of building materials qualifies magnetic fields to realize object positioning in harsh indoor environments. Hence, a DC Magnetic signal based Indoor Local Positioning System (MILPS) has been developed consisting of multiple electrical coils, representing reference stations. Based on the magnetic field intensities of at least three different coils, the corresponding slope distances and therefore the observer's position can be estimated. Facing kinematic purposes a combination of MILPS and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) has been applied, utilizing methods of sensor fusion. Observed inertial data - in this case three dimensional acceleration and angular rate measurements - lead to the sensor's relative motion changes, which are processed by kinematic motion models. Based on a discrete integration with respect to the measurement time interval, the sensor's current state - consisting of position, velocity and orientation - can be predicted. These highfrequency derived predictions are furthermore supported by external MILPS-distances and elevation angles utilizing methods of Kalman Filter. Focus in this contribution lies on the processing of both inertial data and magnetic field measurements for three dimensional applications.","citedby-count":"15","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016653","afid":"60016653","affilname":"Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen","affiliation-city":"Aachen","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011226","afid":"60011226","affilname":"Technische Universität Darmstadt","affiliation-city":"Darmstadt","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55605541700","authid":"55605541700","authname":"Hellmers H.","surname":"Hellmers","given-name":"Hendrik","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011226"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36757682800","authid":"36757682800","authname":"Eichhorn A.","surname":"Eichhorn","given-name":"Andreas","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011226"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36706609400","authid":"36706609400","authname":"Norrdine A.","surname":"Norrdine","given-name":"Abdelmoumen","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016653"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8587829300","authid":"8587829300","authname":"Blankenbach J.","surname":"Blankenbach","given-name":"Jörg","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016653"}]}],"authkeywords":"3D Indoor-Positioning | DC Magnetic Fields | Iterative Kalman Filter | Quaternions","article-number":"7743655","source-id":"21100788399","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85002045767"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85002045767?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85002045767&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85002045767&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85002045767","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85002045767","eid":"2-s2.0-85002045767","dc:title":"The widely linear block quaternion least mean square algorithm for fast computation in 3D audio systems","dc:creator":"Ortolani F.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing, MLSP","prism:issn":"21610363","prism:eIssn":"21610371","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781509007462"}],"prism:volume":"2016-November","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2016-11-08","prism:coverDisplayDate":"8 November 2016","prism:doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2016.7738842","dc:description":"In this paper we propose an algorithm which operates weight adaptation by means of a periodic law and is based on the Widely Linear Quaternion Least Mean Square (WL-QLMS) algorithm.

Unlike traditional local descriptors extracted directly from the original (raw) image space, QMD is derived from the Michelson contrast law and the quaternionic representation (QR) of color images. The Michelson contrast is a stable measurement of image contents from the viewpoint of human perception, while QR is able to handle all the color information of the image holisticly and to preserve the interactions among different color channels. In this way, QMD integrates both the merits of Michelson contrast and QR. Based on the QMD framework, we further propose two novel quaternionic Michelson contrast binary pattern descriptors from different perspectives. Experiments and comparisons on different color image classification databases demonstrate that the proposed framework and descriptors outperform several state-of-the-art methods.","citedby-count":"49","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35146229200","authid":"35146229200","authname":"Lan R.","surname":"Lan","given-name":"Rushi","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24175343600","authid":"24175343600","orcid":"0000-0002-4487-6384","authname":"Zhou Y.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Yicon","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image classification | local descriptor | Michelson contrast | quaternion | quaternionic representation (QR)","source-id":"25534","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85013302170"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85013302170?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85013302170&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85013302170&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85013302170","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85013302170","eid":"2-s2.0-85013302170","dc:title":"Development of active filtering algorithms for higher harmonics in electrical power circuits","dc:creator":"Nos O.V.","prism:publicationName":"Optoelectronics, Instrumentation and Data Processing","prism:issn":"87566990","prism:eIssn":"19347944","prism:volume":"52","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"557-562","prism:coverDate":"2016-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 November 2016","prism:doi":"10.3103/S8756699016060054","dc:description":"Results of developing control algorithms for an active power filter operating as a fast-response current source are presented which provide a significant improvement in the energy consumption performance in the case of a nonlinear load of arbitrary form with a simultaneous possibility of generating reactive power at the fundamental frequency.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033394","afid":"60033394","affilname":"Novosibirsk State Technical University","affiliation-city":"Novosibirsk","affiliation-country":"Russian Federation"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25031690800","authid":"25031690800","authname":"Nos O.V.","surname":"Nos","given-name":"O.

However, it is difficult for the registration of sea scenes imaging with motion camera. In this paper, we propose a new method to detect moving ship by combining optical flow and video attention saliency for video satellite with image registration. Video visual attention is a consequence of some saliency features such as optical flow, Gabor features, intensity. The model proposed for ship detection mainly includes three stages. Firstly, the moving region is estimated based on optical flow with corners. Secondly, Gabor filter is used for texture features extraction of video images. Finally, the above saliency features as several channels are integrated to a quaternion, which can indicate where the ships are located. The experimental results show that the proposed model can effectively extract moving ships in video images without image registration.","citedby-count":"21","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113982100","afid":"113982100","affilname":"Qian Xuesen Laboratory of Space Technology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206827596","authid":"57206827596","authname":"Li H.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Haichao","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113982100"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56517717000","authid":"56517717000","authname":"Man Y.","surname":"Man","given-name":"Yiyun","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113982100"}]}],"authkeywords":"Gabor filter | moving ship detection | optical flow | Video satellite | visual attention","article-number":"7729316","source-id":"82000","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84996570067"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84996570067?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84996570067&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84996570067&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1047320316302103"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84996570067","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84996570067","eid":"2-s2.0-84996570067","dc:title":"Geometrically resilient color image zero-watermarking algorithm based on quaternion Exponent moments","dc:creator":"Wang C.p.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation","prism:issn":"10473203","prism:eIssn":"10959076","prism:volume":"41","prism:pageRange":"247-259","prism:coverDate":"2016-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 November 2016","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jvcir.2016.10.004","pii":"S1047320316302103","dc:description":"Although research on zero-watermarking has made great progress in recent years, most of it has been focused on grayscale images rather than color ones, and cannot resist geometric attacks efficiently. In this paper, we discuss properties of quaternion Exponent moments (QEMs) in detail and propose a robust color image zero-watermarking algorithm which is robust to geometric attacks. We first compute and select robust QEMs of the original color image, and then a binary feature image is constructed using the magnitude of the selected moments. Eventually, a bitwise exclusive-or is applied on the binary feature image and a scrambled binary logo to generate the zero-watermark image. Experimental results show that the proposed zero-watermarking algorithm is robust to both geometric attacks and common image processing attacks effectively. Compared to similar zero-watermarking algorithms and traditional watermarking algorithms based on QEMs, the proposed zero-watermarking algorithm has better performance.","citedby-count":"70","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60088582","afid":"60088582","affilname":"PLA Dalian Naval Academy","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004538","afid":"60004538","affilname":"Dalian University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55318994100","authid":"55318994100","authname":"Wang C.p.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Chun peng","initials":"C.p.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9735589400","authid":"9735589400","authname":"Wang X.y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xing yuan","initials":"X.y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188991071","authid":"57188991071","authname":"Xia Z.q.","surname":"Xia","given-name":"Zhi qiu","initials":"Z.q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192071212","authid":"57192071212","authname":"Zhang C.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Chuan","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23392011600","authid":"23392011600","authname":"Chen X.j.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Xing jun","initials":"X.j.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60088582"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image | Geometric attacks | Quaternion Exponent moments | Zero-watermarking","source-id":"25592","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61173183","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84995784083"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84995784083?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84995784083&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84995784083&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84995784083","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84995784083","eid":"2-s2.0-84995784083","dc:title":"Color image adaptive watermarking algorithm using fractional quaternion Fourier transform","dc:creator":"Wang J.","prism:publicationName":"Dianzi Yu Xinxi Xuebao/Journal of Electronics and Information Technology","prism:issn":"10095896","prism:volume":"38","prism:issueIdentifier":"11","prism:pageRange":"2832-2839","prism:coverDate":"2016-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 November 2016","prism:doi":"10.11999/JEIT160169","dc:description":"Some existing color image adaptive watermarking algorithms do not fully utilize the color information in the adaptive process, or do not consider the holistic property of the components of a color host image. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes a color image adaptive watermarking algorithm based on Fractional Quaternion Fourier Transform (FrQFT). Firstly, the texture, edge and color tone features of the blocks of the host image are extracted using the Human Vision System (HVS). After that, the embedding strength values of the blocks suitable to watermark embedding are set adaptively according to the extracted feature. Finally, the quantization index modulation and the multiple redundant embedding strategy are used to insert the watermark in the FrQFT domain with the adaptive strength. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is superior over the existing algorithm using Quaternion Fourier Transform (QFT) and the algorithm based on Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT).","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143","afid":"60064143","affilname":"Nanjing University of Information Science &amp; Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219116697","authid":"57219116697","authname":"Wang J.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Jinwei","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191990905","authid":"57191990905","authname":"Zhou C.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Chunfei","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36083584200","authid":"36083584200","authname":"Wang S.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Shuiping","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36805188500","authid":"36805188500","authname":"Chen B.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Beijing","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8439524300","authid":"8439524300","authname":"Sun X.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Xingming","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive watermarking | Color image | Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT) | Quaternion","source-id":"24290","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61232016","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84994761222"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84994761222?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84994761222&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84994761222&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84994761222","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84994761222","eid":"2-s2.0-84994761222","dc:title":"Signal conditioning for the kalman filter: Application to satellite attitude estimation with magnetometer and sun sensors","dc:creator":"Esteban S.","prism:publicationName":"Sensors (Switzerland)","prism:issn":"14248220","prism:volume":"16","prism:issueIdentifier":"11","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2016-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2016","prism:doi":"10.3390/s16111817","dc:description":"Most satellites use an on-board attitude estimation system, based on available sensors. In the case of low-cost satellites, which are of increasing interest, it is usual to use magnetometers and Sun sensors. A Kalman filter is commonly recommended for the estimation, to simultaneously exploit the information from sensors and from a mathematical model of the satellite motion. It would be also convenient to adhere to a quaternion representation. This article focuses on some problems linked to this context. The state of the system should be represented in observable form. Singularities due to alignment of measured vectors cause estimation problems. Accommodation of the Kalman filter originates convergence difficulties. The article includes a new proposal that solves these problems, not needing changes in the Kalman filter algorithm. In addition, the article includes assessment of different errors, initialization values for the Kalman filter; and considers the influence of the magnetic dipole moment perturbation, showing how to handle it as part of the Kalman filter framework.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027800","afid":"60027800","affilname":"Universidad de Alcalá","affiliation-city":"Alcala de Henares","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027282","afid":"60027282","affilname":"Universidad Complutense de Madrid","affiliation-city":"Madrid","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026439","afid":"60026439","affilname":"Instituto Nacional de Tecnica Aeroespacial","affiliation-city":"Madrid","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004361089","authid":"7004361089","authname":"Esteban S.","surname":"Esteban","given-name":"Segundo","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027282"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602155778","authid":"6602155778","authname":"Girón-Sierra J.","surname":"Girón-Sierra","given-name":"Jose M.","initials":"J.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027282"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003475352","authid":"7003475352","authname":"Polo Ó.","surname":"Polo","given-name":"Óscar R.","initials":"Ó.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027800"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16400912200","authid":"16400912200","authname":"Angulo M.","surname":"Angulo","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026439"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude determination and control | Condition number | Kalman filter | Low cost satellites | Magnetometer sensor | Quaternion | Sun sensors","article-number":"1817","source-id":"130124","fund-acr":"FP7","fund-no":"313116","fund-sponsor":"Seventh Framework Programme","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}}]}}
