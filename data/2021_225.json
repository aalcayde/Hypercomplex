The performance of the invariance of these moments under the three types of geometrical transformations (Rotation, translation, scale) are very important.

In this study, we propose a robust color image hashing technique based on the quaternionic local ranking binary pattern (QLRBP). First, the values of the RGB color channels are expressed as a pure quaternion, and the texture image is generated using the phase difference of the Clifford translation quaternion as the source for local binary pattern (LBP) comparison data. Next, mean pooling is used to reduce the dimensionality of the image texture. For security, the pixels of the dimension-reduced image are randomly selected, and each pixel is quantized to obtain the final image hash. Experimental results showed that the proposed scheme resists a variety of ordinary image operations and achieves good balance between robustness and discrimination. In comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of our scheme demonstrate its superiority in terms of content identification.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025785","afid":"60025785","affilname":"Shanghai Maritime University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008691","afid":"60008691","affilname":"University of Shanghai for Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57218585378","authid":"57218585378","authname":"Liu E.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Enli","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008691"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/52464719400","authid":"52464719400","orcid":"0000-0002-3784-4157","authname":"Yao H.","surname":"Yao","given-name":"Heng","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008691"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57208407428","authid":"57208407428","authname":"Hu Y.","surname":"Hu","given-name":"Yecen","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008691"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36843824300","authid":"36843824300","authname":"Cao F.","surname":"Cao","given-name":"Fang","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025785"}]}],"authkeywords":"Clifford translation of quaternion | Local binary pattern | Perceptual image hashing | Quaternion | quaternionic local ranking binary pattern","source-id":"18958","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61702332","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85088208854"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85088208854?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85088208854&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85088208854&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85088208854","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85088208854","eid":"2-s2.0-85088208854","dc:title":"Quaternion Polar Complex Exponential Transform and Local Binary Pattern-Based Fusion Features for Content-Based Image Retrieval","dc:creator":"Kishore D.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering","prism:issn":"18761100","prism:eIssn":"18761119","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789811538278"}],"prism:volume":"655","prism:pageRange":"769-776","prism:coverDate":"2021-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2021","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-981-15-3828-5_80","dc:description":"The presented work is a sincere effort to exhibit content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system utilized for extracting images from large databases.

Because the single modality-based biometric frameworks limit performance in terms of accuracy and anti-spoofing capabilities due to the presence of low quality data, therefore, information fusion of more than one biometric characteristic in pursuit of high recognition results can be beneficial. In this article, we present a multimodal biometric system based on information fusion of palm print and finger knuckle traits, which are least associated to any criminal investigation as evidence yet. The proposed multimodal biometric system might be useful to identify the suspects in case of physical beating or kidnapping and establish supportive scientific evidences, when no fingerprint or face information is present in photographs. The first step in our work is data preprocessing, in which region of interest of palm and finger knuckle images have been extracted. To minimize nonuniform illumination effects, we first normalize the detected circular palm or finger knuckle and then apply line ordinal pattern (LOP)-based encoding scheme for texture enrichment. The nondecimated quaternion wavelet provides denser feature representation at multiple scales and orientations when extracted over proposed LOP encoding and increases the discrimination power of line and ridge features. To best of our knowledge, this first attempt is a combination of backtracking search algorithm and 2D2LDA has been employed to select the dominant palm and knuckle features for classification. The classifiers output for two modalities are combined at unsupervised rank level fusion rule through Borda count method, which shows an increase in performance in terms of recognition and verification, that is, 100% (correct recognition rate), 0.26% (equal error rate), 3.52 (discriminative index), and 1,262 m (speed).","citedby-count":"16","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60117484","afid":"60117484","affilname":"National Agri-Food Biotechnology Institute","affiliation-city":"Mohali","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013141","afid":"60013141","affilname":"Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet","affiliation-city":"Trondheim","affiliation-country":"Norway"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56897214300","authid":"56897214300","orcid":"0000-0002-3971-0160","authname":"Jaswal G.","surname":"Jaswal","given-name":"Gaurav","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60117484"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56638603100","authid":"56638603100","authname":"Poonia R.C.","surname":"Poonia","given-name":"Ramesh Chandra","initials":"R.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013141"}]}],"authkeywords":"2D LDA 2 | back tracking search | line ordinal pattern | quaternion wavelet | random forest","article-number":"e12523","source-id":"24185","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
