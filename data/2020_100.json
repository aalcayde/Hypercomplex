However, traditional ship detection methods have low detection efficiency and poor reliability due to uncertain conditions of the sea surface, such as the atmosphere, illumination, clouds and islands. Hence, in this study, a novel ship target automatic detection system based on a modified hypercomplex Flourier transform (MHFT) saliency model is proposed for spatial resolution of remote-sensing images. The method first utilizes visual saliency theory to effectively suppress sea surface interference. Then we use OTSU methods to extract regions of interest. After obtaining the candidate ship target regions, we get the candidate target using a method of ship target recognition based on ResNet framework. This method has better accuracy and better performance for the recognition of ship targets than other methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method not only accurately and effectively recognizes ship targets, but also is suitable for spatial resolution of remote-sensing images with complex backgrounds.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027363","afid":"60027363","affilname":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004828","afid":"60004828","affilname":"Changchun Institute of Optics Fine Mechanics and Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"32365652","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205587882","authid":"57205587882","authname":"He J.","surname":"He","given-name":"Jian","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12344644200","authid":"12344644200","authname":"Guo Y.","surname":"Guo","given-name":"Yongfei","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56818289500","authid":"56818289500","authname":"Yuan H.","surname":"Yuan","given-name":"Hangfei","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"}]}],"authkeywords":"HFT | Remote sensing | ResNet | Saliency model | Ship detection","article-number":"2536","source-id":"130124","fund-no":"2016YFB0500100","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85083355483"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85083355483?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85083355483&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85083355483&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85083355483","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85083355483","eid":"2-s2.0-85083355483","dc:title":"Robust cooperative manipulation without force/torque measurements: Control design and experiments","dc:creator":"Verginis C.K.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","prism:issn":"10636536","prism:eIssn":"15580865","prism:volume":"28","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"713-729","prism:coverDate":"2020-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May 2020","prism:doi":"10.1109/TCST.2018.2885682","dc:description":"This paper presents two novel control methodologies for the cooperative manipulation of an object by N robotic agents. First, we design an adaptive control protocol which employs quaternion feedback for the object orientation to avoid potential representation singularities. Second, we propose a control protocol that guarantees predefined transient and steady-state performance for the object trajectory. Both methodologies are decentralized, since the agents calculate their own signals without communicating with each other, as well as robust to external disturbances and model uncertainties. Moreover, we consider that the grasping points are rigid and avoid the need for force/torque measurements. Load distribution is also included via a grasp matrix pseudoinverse to account for potential differences in the agents' power capabilities.

For this reason, the seven invariant moments presented by Hu are widely used in the field of image analysis. These moments are of finite order; therefore, they do not comprise a complete set of image descriptors. For this reason, we introduce in this paper another series of invariant moments of infinite order, which are based on normalized central moments. The non-orthogonal property of these moments causes the redundancy of information. To overcome this problem, we propose a new construction technique of non-separable orthogonal polynomials in two variables based on a recurrence formula and we present a new set of orthogonal moments, which are invariant to translation, scaling and rotation. The presented approaches are tested in several well-known computer vision datasets including moment’s invariability, image retrieval and classification of objects, this latter based on fuzzy K-means clustering algorithm. The performance of these invariant moments for classification and image retrieval is compared with some recent invariant moments such as invariants of multi-channel orthogonal radial-substituted Chebyshev moments, invariants of quaternion radial-substituted Chebyshev moments, invariants of rotational moments in Radon space and Legendre–Fourier moments in Radon space. The experimental results made using four databases of images, namely Columbia Object Image Library (COIL-20) database, MPEG7-CE shape database, COIL-100 database and ORL database, show that our orthogonal invariant moments have done better than the other descriptors tested.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60088902","afid":"60088902","affilname":"Université Sultan Moulay Slimane","affiliation-city":"Beni Mellal","affiliation-country":"Morocco"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203208053","authid":"57203208053","authname":"Hjouji A.","surname":"Hjouji","given-name":"Amal","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60088902"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55701011000","authid":"55701011000","authname":"EL-Mekkaoui J.","surname":"EL-Mekkaoui","given-name":"Jaouad","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60088902"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6506527941","authid":"6506527941","authname":"Jourhmane M.","surname":"Jourhmane","given-name":"Mostafa","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60088902"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55969688700","authid":"55969688700","authname":"Bouikhalene B.","surname":"Bouikhalene","given-name":"Belaid","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60088902"}]}],"authkeywords":"Image classification | Image retrieval | Orthogonal invariant moments | Pattern recognition | Rotation, scaling and translation invariants","source-id":"28501","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85078613755"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85078613755?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85078613755&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85078613755&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85078613755","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85078613755","eid":"2-s2.0-85078613755","dc:title":"Denoising Color Images Based on Local Orientation Estimation and CNN Classifier","dc:creator":"Jin L.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision","prism:issn":"09249907","prism:eIssn":"15737683","prism:volume":"62","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"505-531","prism:coverDate":"2020-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 May 2020","prism:doi":"10.1007/s10851-019-00942-8","dc:description":"A structure-adaptive vector filter for removal of impulse noise from color images is presented. The proposed method is based on local orientation estimation. A color image is represented in quaternion form, and then, quaternion Fourier transform is used to compute the orientation of the pattern in a local neighborhood. Since the computation in quaternion frequency domain is extremely time-consuming, we prove a theorem that the integral of the product of frequency variables and the magnitude of quaternion frequency signals can be computed directly in spatial domain, which results that the color orientation detection problem can be solved in spatial domain. Based on the local orientation and orientation strength, the size, shape, and orientation of the support window of vector median filter (VMF) are adaptively determined, leading to an effective structure-adaptive VMF. Unlike the classical VMF restricting the output to the existing color samples, this paper computes the output of VMF over the entire 3D data space, which boosts the filtering performance effectively. To further improve denoising effect, a deep convolutional neural network is employed to detect impulse noise in color images and integrated into the proposed denoising framework. The experimental results exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed denoiser by showing significant performance improvements both in noise suppression and in detail preservation, compared to other color image denoising methods.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025761","afid":"60025761","affilname":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15922652500","authid":"15922652500","authname":"Jin L.","surname":"Jin","given-name":"Lianghai","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23767272300","authid":"23767272300","authname":"Song E.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Enmin","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202222125","authid":"57202222125","authname":"Zhang W.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Wenhua","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image | Convolutional neural network | Impulse noise | Orientation estimation | Quaternion | Structure-adaptive filter","source-id":"28501","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61370181","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067050728"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067050728?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85067050728&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85067050728&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067050728","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85067050728","eid":"2-s2.0-85067050728","dc:title":"Color image segmentation using proximal classifier and quaternion radial harmonic Fourier moments","dc:creator":"Wang X.Y.","prism:publicationName":"Pattern Analysis and Applications","prism:issn":"14337541","prism:eIssn":"1433755X","prism:volume":"23","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"683-702","prism:coverDate":"2020-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 May 2020","prism:doi":"10.1007/s10044-019-00826-y","dc:description":"Segmentation involves separating an object from the background in a given image. Image segmentation has a variety of applications and has received considerable attention in multimedia application and computer vision. Although numerous approaches have been introduced, image segmentation is still far from being solved due to most of image segmentation algorithms are often so complicated and some unsatisfactory results appear frequently. Therefore, developing a suitable technique of image segmentation is still a challenging problem. In this article, a novel color image segmentation will be introduced based on quaternion radial harmonic Fourier moments (QRHFMs) and proximal classifier. Firstly, the image feature of pixel-level is represented by the accurate and invariant QRHFMs holistically as a vector field, which can describe sufficiently the image pixel information due to take into account the relationship among different color channels. Secondly, the image feature from pixel-level is utilized as the input of the proximal classifier with consistency (PCC), which not only has lower computation time but also has better generalization compared to traditional support vector machines classifiers. Then, we choose the training samples by Tsallis entropy thresholding to train PCC classification model. Finally, the color image is classified by the trained PCC classification model. Our algorithm can make full use of the accurate and robust local image feature, as well the quickness and generalization ability of PCC classifier. A series of experimental results shows that this algorithm has better segmentation performance than the state-of-the-art method from the literature.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017010","afid":"60017010","affilname":"Liaoning Normal University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000937","afid":"60000937","affilname":"Shenzhen University","affiliation-city":"Shenzhen","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972239800","authid":"34972239800","authname":"Wang X.Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiang Yang","initials":"X.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209247931","authid":"57209247931","authname":"Wang Q.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Qian","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209261455","authid":"57209261455","authname":"Wang X.B.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xue Bin","initials":"X.B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972350300","authid":"34972350300","authname":"Yang H.Y.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Hong Ying","initials":"H.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56495727800","authid":"56495727800","authname":"Wu Z.F.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Zhi Fang","initials":"Z.F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16205443400","authid":"16205443400","authname":"Niu P.P.","surname":"Niu","given-name":"Pan Pan","initials":"P.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000937"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image segmentation | Proximal classifier with consistency | Quaternion radial harmonic Fourier moments | Tsallis entropy | Twin support vector machines","source-id":"24822","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"2017RQ055","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063025422"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063025422?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85063025422&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85063025422&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063025422","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85063025422","eid":"2-s2.0-85063025422","dc:title":"Multi-scale multi-block covariance descriptor with feature selection","dc:creator":"Moujahid A.","prism:publicationName":"Neural Computing and Applications","prism:issn":"09410643","prism:eIssn":"14333058","prism:volume":"32","prism:issueIdentifier":"10","prism:pageRange":"6283-6294","prism:coverDate":"2020-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 May 2020","prism:doi":"10.1007/s00521-019-04135-7","dc:description":"This paper investigates a compact face texture representation able to cover the most discriminant features of facial images. The compactness is achieved by the proposed Pyramid Multi-Level (PML) covariance texture descriptor and the feature selection process that is applied on the raw extracted features. In fact, we introduce a framework based mainly on two new aspects. Firstly, we consider an extension of the original covariance descriptor that relies on de-noised covariance matrices obtained using texture descriptors such as local binary pattern and quaternionic local ranking binary pattern images. Secondly, we exploit the resulting covariance descriptor using a PML face representation which allows a multi-level multi-scale feature extraction. Experiments conducted on four public face datasets show the efficacy of the proposed face descriptor and the associated selection schemes.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027856","afid":"60027856","affilname":"Universidad del Pais Vasco","affiliation-city":"Leioa","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602925990","authid":"6602925990","orcid":"0000-0002-4971-3613","authname":"Moujahid A.","surname":"Moujahid","given-name":"Abdelmalik","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027856"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55967501800","authid":"55967501800","authname":"Dornaika F.","surname":"Dornaika","given-name":"Fadi","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027856"}]}],"authkeywords":"Face recognition | Face texture representation | Feature selection","source-id":"24800","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059579757"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059579757?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059579757&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059579757&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059579757","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85059579757","eid":"2-s2.0-85059579757","dc:title":"An LBP encoding scheme jointly using quaternionic representation and angular information","dc:creator":"Lan R.","prism:publicationName":"Neural Computing and Applications","prism:issn":"09410643","prism:eIssn":"14333058","prism:volume":"32","prism:issueIdentifier":"9","prism:pageRange":"4317-4323","prism:coverDate":"2020-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 May 2020","prism:doi":"10.1007/s00521-018-03968-y","dc:description":"Local descriptors play a crucial role in numerous computer vision and pattern recognition applications.

Using QR, the quaternionic angular information is further developed to account for more color characteristics. We provide two ways to derive the quaternionic angular information from different perspectives. A pattern encoding operation is finally conducted on the obtained angular information to obtain QLABP.

In this article, a color image splicing detection approach is proposed based on Markov transition probability of quaternion component separation in quaternion discrete cosine transform (QDCT) domain and quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) domain. First, Markov features of the intra-block and inter-block between block QDCT coefficients are obtained from the real parts and three imaginary parts of QDCT coefficients, respectively. Then, additional Markov features are extracted from the luminance (Y) channel in the quaternion wavelet transform domain to characterize the dependency of position among quaternion wavelet sub-band coefficients. Finally, an ensemble classifier (EC) is exploited to classify the spliced and authentic color images. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach can outperform some state-of-the-art methods.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60273040","afid":"60273040","affilname":"Institute of Information Engineering","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143","afid":"60064143","affilname":"Nanjing University of Information Science &amp; Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021182","afid":"60021182","affilname":"Sun Yat-Sen University","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017456","afid":"60017456","affilname":"Jinan University","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book","subtype":"ch","subtypeDescription":"Book Chapter","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202368398","authid":"57202368398","authname":"Wang R.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Ruxin","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021182"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57715097700","authid":"57715097700","authname":"Lu W.","surname":"Lu","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021182"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202462417","authid":"57202462417","authname":"Li J.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Jixian","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021182"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12804229800","authid":"12804229800","authname":"Xiang S.","surname":"Xiang","given-name":"Shijun","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017456"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55623697900","authid":"55623697900","authname":"Zhao X.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Xianfeng","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60273040"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219116697","authid":"57219116697","authname":"Wang J.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Jinwei","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]}],"source-id":"21101105105","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85095731752"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85095731752?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85095731752&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85095731752&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1044532320300270"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85095731752","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85095731752","eid":"2-s2.0-85095731752","dc:title":"Interrogating the microenvironmental landscape of tumors with computational image analysis approaches","dc:creator":"Valous N.A.","prism:publicationName":"Seminars in Immunology","prism:issn":"10445323","prism:eIssn":"10963618","prism:volume":"48","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2020","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.smim.2020.101411","pii":"S1044532320300270","dc:description":"The tumor microenvironment is an interacting heterogeneous collection of cancer cells, resident as well as infiltrating host cells, secreted factors, and extracellular matrix proteins.

The least squares algorithm is often used to solve problems in the application of BDS, while the quaternary nonlinear equation set is used for solving the positioning and timing issues. The application of least square algorithm in the PVT solution of Beidou satellite navigation is to solve a set of quaternion nonlinear equations. The solution of the least squares is an iterative process, but if the convergence threshold is too small in the iterative process, it may lead to iteration without convergence. In order to improve the failure of convergence caused by too small convergence threshold in the original algorithm, a least squares algorithm based on dynamic threshold was proposed in this paper. The proposed algorithm could continue iteration until convergence by increasing the system's dynamic threshold. At the same time, the proposed algorithm could also change the satellite combination in time, so as to conduct the positioning and calculation again over the threshold value that increases to a fixed value but fails to converge. And the simulation results show that if the threshold is set too small, it can converge well. As a result, the algorithm not only effectively prevents the program failure in Beidou satellite positioning caused by the convergence failure of algorithm iteration, but also greatly improves the stability and reliability of the system program operation.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60083518","afid":"60083518","affilname":"Chongqing Three Gorges University","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56187057800","authid":"56187057800","authname":"Lei G.","surname":"Lei","given-name":"Guoping","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60083518"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57214152967","authid":"57214152967","authname":"Luo X.","surname":"Luo","given-name":"Xiuying","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60083518"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57217072476","authid":"57217072476","authname":"Liu Z.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Zhiyuan","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60083518"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36663497100","authid":"36663497100","authname":"Dai M.","surname":"Dai","given-name":"Minlu","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60083518"}]}],"authkeywords":"Convergence | Dynamic threshold | Eidou satellite | Least squares algorithm | Positioning algorithm","article-number":"9115173","source-id":"21101020129","fund-no":"KJQN201801212","fund-sponsor":"Natural Science Foundation Project of Chongqing, Chongqing Science and Technology Commission","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85086765806"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85086765806?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85086765806&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85086765806&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85086765806","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85086765806","eid":"2-s2.0-85086765806","dc:title":"A 3D Image Quality Assessment Method Based on Vector Information and SVD of Quaternion Matrix under Cloud Computing Environment","dc:creator":"Liu X.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","prism:eIssn":"21687161","prism:volume":"8","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"326-337","prism:coverDate":"2020-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April-June 2020","prism:doi":"10.1109/TCC.2015.2513397","dc:description":"With the increasing demands of end-users to the visual perception in three-dimension (3D) image, quality assessment for 3D imageis dominantly required as the feedback information for multimedia transmission systems. In this paper, a novel full-reference quality assessment method by considering the depth and integral color information of 3D image under cloud computing environment is proposed. Based on the property of the depth information in 3D image, the depth map is firstly separated into different planes according to the perception of human visual system (HVS). Then, after express the image pixels of every separated plane through quaternions, the structural and energy information are separated by quaternion singular value decomposition (QSVD). The distortion of structural and energy in every plane are calculated in various formulas respectively. The final result is calculated in terms of the global score, which synthesizes the structural and energy distortion scores in every individual depth plane. It should be pointed out that the chrominance information is employed in our mechanism to evaluate the color image quality because of its useful characteristic for 3D color image quality assessment, and its spatial correlation is used for calculating structural distortion through vector cross-product. Our experimental results confirm that the proposed method has achieves better performance under cloud computing environments compared with other existing 3D image quality assessment methods.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005465","afid":"60005465","affilname":"University of Electronic Science and Technology of China","affiliation-city":"Chengdu","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36623949900","authid":"36623949900","orcid":"0000-0003-4881-0216","authname":"Liu X.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Xingang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56970973900","authid":"56970973900","authname":"Zhang L.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Lan","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56562302600","authid":"56562302600","authname":"Lu K.","surname":"Lu","given-name":"Kaixuan","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]}],"authkeywords":"Cloud computing | Color image quality assessment | Depth information | Quaternion singular value decomposition (QSVD) | Structural information | Three dimension (3D) image","article-number":"7368888","source-id":"21100338351","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"G0501020161301268","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85084474461"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85084474461?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85084474461&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85084474461&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85084474461","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85084474461","eid":"2-s2.0-85084474461","dc:title":"Space reconstruction using single-line LIDAR and GNSS/INS fused data","dc:creator":"Wang R.","prism:publicationName":"Guangxue Jingmi Gongcheng/Optics and Precision Engineering","prism:issn":"1004924X","prism:volume":"28","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"851-858","prism:coverDate":"2020-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 April 2020","prism:doi":"10.3788/OPE.20202804.0851","dc:description":"In a three-dimensional reconstruction task, the pitch range of the multi-layer light detection and ranging (LIDAR) is limited, and the data account of the multi-layer LIDAR is large, which increases the computational burden.

Accurate classification of these galaxies enables scientists to understand the formation and evolution of the Universe. During the last decades, there have been several methods applied to classify the galaxy images. However, these methods encounter three big challenges. First, most existing methods converted the color images of galaxies into gray images which result in losing the essential color information. Second, the utilized feature selection methods, that used to remove the irrelevant features, may be stuck at the attractive local point. Third, using an irrelevant classifier could lead to decrease the classification accuracy. In this paper, a new algorithm is proposed to classify color images of galaxies. In this algorithm, highly accurate non-redundant color features are extracted from the color images of galaxies by using the quaternion polar complex exponential transform moments (QPCET). The quaternion representation deals with a color image in a holistic way which keeps the correlation between components and then successfully represents the color images. The QPCET moments are highly accurate, noise resistant, and numerically stable. Moreover, these moments are invariants with respect to rotation, scaling and translation (RST). These characteristics assure the excellency of the extracted color features. The Stochastic Fractal Search (SFS) has a very high ability to avoid the stuck at local point. Its binary version is utilized to select the most appropriate features which improve the classification process. The Extreme Machine learning (EML) is used to classify the color images of galaxies using the selected color features. Experiments are performed with the well-known datasets of galaxies (EFIGI catalog), where the proposed algorithm achieved high classification rate.

First, based on quaternion theory, a novel algorithm named quaternion noncircular MUSIC (QNC-MUSIC) is proposed, and direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is achieved for circular and noncircular signals. Then, a dimension reduction procedure is performed for the parameter search by employing the partial derivative of the spectrum function with respect to the noncircular phase; thus, a novel dimensional reduction noncircular MUSIC (DRNC-MUSIC) algorithm with a low computational complexity is proposed for DOA and polarization estimation of circular signals and noncircular signals.

In order to eliminate the interference caused by vibration on the measurement and quickly obtain the accurate attitude parameters of the steering drilling tool, a new method for multi-sensor dynamic attitude combined measurement is presented. Firstly, by using a triaxial accelerometer and triaxial magnetometer measurement system, the nonlinear model based on the quaternion is established. Then, an improved adaptive fading square root unscented Kalman filter is proposed for eliminating the vibration disturbance signal. In this algorithm, the square root of the state covariance matrix is used to replace the covariance matrix in the classical unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to avoid the filter divergence caused by the negative definite state covariance matrix. The fading factor is introduced into UKF to adjust the filter gain in real-time and improve the adaptive ability of the algorithm to mutation state. Finally, the computational method of the fading factor is optimized to ensure the self-adaptability of the algorithm and reduce the computational complexity. The results of the laboratory test and the field-drilling data show that the proposed method can filter out the interference noise in the attitude measurement sensor effectively, improve the solution accuracy of attitude parameters of drilling tools in the case of abrupt changes in the measuring environment, and thus ensuring the dynamic stability of the well trajectory.","citedby-count":"13","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025279","afid":"60025279","affilname":"Xi'an Shiyou University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"32235394","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57197867558","authid":"57197867558","authname":"Yang Y.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Yi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025279"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205526396","authid":"57205526396","authname":"Li F.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Fei","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025279"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55731336700","authid":"55731336700","authname":"Gao Y.","surname":"Gao","given-name":"Yi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025279"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55585304300","authid":"55585304300","authname":"Mao Y.","surname":"Mao","given-name":"Yanhui","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025279"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive fading factor | Multi-sensor combined measurement | Quaternion | Square root filter | Unscented kalman filter","article-number":"1897","source-id":"130124","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"51704238","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85081924453"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85081924453?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85081924453&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85081924453&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S003040262030396X"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85081924453","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85081924453","eid":"2-s2.0-85081924453","dc:title":"A robust blind color image watermarking based on Fourier transform domain","dc:creator":"Fares K.","prism:publicationName":"Optik","prism:issn":"00304026","prism:volume":"208","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2020","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.ijleo.2020.164562","pii":"S003040262030396X","dc:description":"In this work, we propose a new substitution scheme for color images watermarking based on the Fourier transform.

The star-tracker is able to determine the attitude from the view field of the star set without any prior knowledge of sensor information. In this paper, the design, simulation and implementation of a star-tracker is presented for LEO satellites. For capturing image data, the MT9P031 CMOS image sensor from Aptina Imaging was used. The star tracker uses a Texas Instrument OMAP3530 using an ARM Cortex A8. The processor supports powerful graphic interfaces resulting in reduction of the size and consumption power of the star-tracker. For storage and processing, the star tracker used NAND flash memory. The communication interface to the satellite is done through CAN Bus. One of the key features of this sensor is processing various algorithms for image processing, positioning, and tracking according to mission requirements. Quaternion estimator (QUEST) algorithm was utilized for positioning. The tracking algorithm utilizes information from the previous frame of the star-tracking.

The accuracy of skull registration directly affects the outcome of craniofacial restoration. In order to improve the registration accuracy and convergence speed of skull point cloud model, a registration algorithm based on the hierarchical optimization strategy is proposed. The registration process is divided into two processes, coarse registration and fine registration. The different optimization strategies are used for optimization. Firstly, the geometric features are extracted based on the neighborhood of points, and then the eigenvectors consisting of mean curvature, Gauss curvature, normal vector angle, and principal curvature are obtained. Further, the feature similarity is calculated by distance function to establish matching point pairs, and k-means algorithm is used to eliminate the mismatching point pairs. Then the quaternion method is used to calculate the rigid body transformation relationship between the skull point clouds to achieve skull coarse registration. Finally, the improved iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm is improved by the introducing k-d tree and geometric feature constraints. The improved ICP algorithm is used to achieve accurate skull registration. The experimental results show that it is effective to use the k-means algorithm to eliminate the mismatched point pair optimization strategy. It is also effective to add the k-d tree and geometric feature constraint optimization strategy to the fine registration process. Compared with ICP algorithm, the matching rate and registration accuracy of this algorithm are improved by 17% and 51%, respectively, and the time-consuming is reduced by 31%. Compared with other classical registration algorithms and improved ICP algorithm, the efficiency of the proposed algorithm is the best. In order to verify the universality of the algorithm, the terra cotta warriors fragment data is also used to verify, and the proposed algorithm achieves good results and optimal performance. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is an effective point cloud registration method.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001298","afid":"60001298","affilname":"Northwest University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201653133","authid":"57201653133","authname":"Yang W.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Wen","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001298"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9332570500","authid":"9332570500","authname":"Zhou M.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Mingquan","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001298"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216931870","authid":"57216931870","authname":"Zhang X.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xiangkui","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001298"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006815450","authid":"7006815450","authname":"Geng G.","surname":"Geng","given-name":"Guohua","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001298"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7409282479","authid":"7409282479","authname":"Liu X.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Xiaoning","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001298"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216931969","authid":"57216931969","authname":"Liu Y.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Yangyang","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001298"}]}],"authkeywords":"Geometric feature constraints | Iterative closest point algorithm | K-dimensional tree | K-means algorithm | Machine vision | Skull registration","article-number":"0615001","source-id":"29717","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85083007049"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85083007049?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85083007049&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85083007049&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85083007049","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85083007049","eid":"2-s2.0-85083007049","dc:title":"Fusion Algorithm of Image Enhancement Based on Quaternion Wavelet Transform and Adaptive Neural Network","dc:creator":"Ma S.","prism:publicationName":"Xi'an Shiyou Daxue Xuebao (Ziran Kexue Ban)/Journal of Xi'an Shiyou University, Natural Sciences Edition","prism:issn":"1673064X","prism:volume":"35","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"113-119","prism:coverDate":"2020-03-25","prism:coverDisplayDate":"25 March 2020","prism:doi":"10.3969/j.issn.1673-064X.2020.02.017","dc:description":"The visible light image, infrared image and ambient noise from the same object are often fused together in night environment, which results in the deterioration of image definition and blurred edges. In order to improve the visual effect of the night images, an infrared and visible image fusion algorithm based on quaternion wavelet transform and adaptive neural network is proposed. Firstly, the algorithm dynamically compresses and adaptively enhances the weak light information in the night original image; secondly, the visible and infrared parts of the enhanced image are decomposed by using quaternion wavelet transform, the fusion algorithm with the largest coefficient is adopted in low frequency part and the parameter adaptive fusion algorithm of neural network is used in high frequency part; finally, the enhanced image is obtained by using the inverse transform of the quaternion wavelet. The theoretical and experimental results show that the algorithm can improve the extraction effect of the same target image in night condition.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104931","afid":"60104931","affilname":"Xi'an Polytechnic University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60087531","afid":"60087531","affilname":"Ningxia Teachers University","affiliation-city":"Guyuan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55245325000","authid":"55245325000","authname":"Ma S.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Shulan","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60087531"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55891753000","authid":"55891753000","authname":"Chang L.","surname":"Chang","given-name":"Lihong","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60087531"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23027963500","authid":"23027963500","authname":"Ma B.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Baoke","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104931"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive neural network | Guided image filtering | Image fusion | Quaternion wavelet transform","source-id":"145055","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
