Strategic utilizations of such benefits would include, e.g., hypercomplex singular value decomposition (SVD) and low-rank approximation of matrices. In this paper, as powerful mathematical tools for wider signal processing applications of hypercomplex number systems, we first propose novel definitions of SVD and best low-rank approximation of matrices based on algebraic translations of Cayley-Dickson (C-D) number systems. We then derive an algorithmic solution to hypercomplex tensor completion problem based on a convex optimization technique. Numerical experiments in a scenario of color tensor completion problem show that the proposed algorithm recovers much more faithfully the original color information, masked randomly by noise, than part-wise tensor completion algorithms.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031126","afid":"60031126","affilname":"Tokyo Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tokyo","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55967323300","authid":"55967323300","orcid":"0000-0002-6213-6996","authname":"Mizoguchi T.","surname":"Mizoguchi","given-name":"Takehiko","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031126"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35486046100","authid":"35486046100","orcid":"0000-0002-6563-7526","authname":"Yamada I.","surname":"Yamada","given-name":"Isao","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031126"}]}],"authkeywords":"Cayley-Dickson construction | Cayley-Dickson eigenvalue problem | Cayley-Dickson singular value decomposition | convex optimization | hypercomplex tensor completion | proximal splitting","article-number":"8734773","source-id":"17391","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067384067"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067384067?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85067384067&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85067384067&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S221421261930050X"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067384067","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85067384067","eid":"2-s2.0-85067384067","dc:title":"Color image-spliced localization based on quaternion principal component analysis and quaternion skewness","dc:creator":"Wang J.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Information Security and Applications","prism:issn":"22142134","prism:eIssn":"22142126","prism:volume":"47","prism:pageRange":"353-362","prism:coverDate":"2019-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"August 2019","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jisa.2019.06.004","pii":"S221421261930050X","dc:description":"Splicing is a common tampering operation where the splicing area and the original image have different noise levels. In this paper, novel color spliced image localization based on quaternion principal component analysis (QPCA) and quaternion skewness is proposed. Firstly, the proposed algorithm uses QPCA to estimate the block-wise noise level. Then K-means algorithm is used to distinguish the splicing region from the original image. Next, in order to increase inconsistencies of the noise level in image blocks from different images, quaternion skewness is employed to select the overlapping patches of image blocks. In addition, morphological methods are applied to the fine classification results to reduce the false detection rate and miss detection rate along the boundary blocks between the original area and spliced area.

We solve a convex optimization problem, which minimizes a nuclear norm of quaternion matrix that is a convex surrogate for the quaternion matrix rank, and the ℓ1-norm of sparse quaternion matrix entries. We show that, under incoherence conditions, a quaternion matrix can be recovered exactly with overwhelming probability, provided that its rank is sufficiently small and that the corrupted entries are sparsely located. The quaternion framework can be used to represent red, green, and blue channels of color images. The results of missing/noisy color image pixels as a robust quaternion matrix completion problem are given to show that the performance of the proposed approach is better than that of the testing methods, including image inpainting methods, the tensor-based completion method, and the quaternion completion method using semidefinite programming.","citedby-count":"55","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014347","afid":"60014347","affilname":"Hong Kong Baptist University","affiliation-city":null,"affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004691","afid":"60004691","affilname":"Jiangsu Normal University","affiliation-city":"Xuzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003736","afid":"60003736","affilname":"Weifang University","affiliation-city":"Weifang","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8264355300","authid":"8264355300","authname":"Jia Z.","surname":"Jia","given-name":"Zhigang","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004691"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004691"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34571761900","authid":"34571761900","orcid":"0000-0001-6833-5227","authname":"Ng M.K.","surname":"Ng","given-name":"Michael K.","initials":"M.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014347"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16317511000","authid":"16317511000","authname":"Song G.J.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Guang Jing","initials":"G.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003736"}]}],"authkeywords":"color images | convex optimization | low rank | matrix recovery | quaternion","article-number":"e2245","source-id":"25712","fund-acr":"HKBU","fund-no":"RC-ICRS/16-17/03","fund-sponsor":"Hong Kong Baptist University","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85051057946"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85051057946?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85051057946&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85051057946&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85051057946","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85051057946","eid":"2-s2.0-85051057946","dc:title":"Invariant color images representation using accurate quaternion Legendre–Fourier moments","dc:creator":"Hosny K.M.","prism:publicationName":"Pattern Analysis and Applications","prism:issn":"14337541","prism:volume":"22","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"1105-1122","prism:coverDate":"2019-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 August 2019","prism:doi":"10.1007/s10044-018-0740-1","dc:description":"Color image representation using quaternion moments has gained more interest during the last few years.

Here, a novel sub-image approach is proposed for extremely fast and highly accurate detecting of the duplicated forged objects in colour images. The proposed approach consists of few steps. The input coloured images are converted into the hue-saturation-value (HSV) colour model. Then, the edges of all objects in the forged image are detected using the Sobel operator. Morphological opening operator and median filter are used in removing unnecessary small objects. The boundaries of the duplicated objects are accurately detected. A bounding rectangle is drawn around the detected object to form a sub-image. The features of this sub-image are extracted by using the quaternion polar complex exponential transform moments (QPCETMs) and their invariants to rotation, scaling, and translation. Finally, the duplicated regions are matched via calculating the Euclidian distances and the correlation between the feature vectors. Experiments are performed using different types of duplicated regions. The obtained results of the proposed method are much accurate when compared with the results of the existing methods. Also, the proposed method exhibits high robustness against different attacks such as additive white Gaussian noise, JPEG compression, scaling, and rotation.","citedby-count":"27","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60274165","afid":"60274165","affilname":"Faculty of Computers and Information","affiliation-city":"Zagazig","affiliation-country":"Egypt"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205214086","authid":"57205214086","orcid":"0000-0001-8065-8977","authname":"Hosny K.M.","surname":"Hosny","given-name":"Khalid M.","initials":"K.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60274165"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201690843","authid":"57201690843","authname":"Hamza H.M.","surname":"Hamza","given-name":"Hanaa M.","initials":"H.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60274165"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201691481","authid":"57201691481","authname":"Lashin N.A.","surname":"Lashin","given-name":"Nabil A.","initials":"N.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60274165"}]}],"authkeywords":"feature extraction | image colour analysis | image filtering | image forensics | median filters | object detection | transforms","source-id":"5400152646","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067092584"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067092584?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85067092584&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85067092584&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067092584","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85067092584","eid":"2-s2.0-85067092584","dc:title":"Geometric-Algebra Adaptive Filters","dc:creator":"Lopes W.B.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","prism:issn":"1053587X","prism:eIssn":"19410476","prism:volume":"67","prism:issueIdentifier":"14","prism:pageRange":"3649-3662","prism:coverDate":"2019-07-15","prism:coverDisplayDate":"15 July 2019","prism:doi":"10.1109/TSP.2019.2916028","dc:description":"This paper reformulates adaptive filters (AFs) in the framework of geometric algebra (GA), developing a complete study of the resulting geometric-algebra adaptive filters (GAAFs). They are generated by formulating the underlying minimization problem (a deterministic cost function) from the perspective of GA, a comprehensive mathematical language well suited for the description of geometric transformations. Also, differently from standard adaptive-filtering theory, geometric calculus (the extension of GA to differential calculus) allows for applying the same derivation techniques regardless of the type (subalgebra) of the data, i.e., real, complex numbers, quaternions, etc. Relying on those characteristics (among others), a deterministic quadratic cost function is posed, from which the GAAFs are devised, providing a generalization of regular AFs to subalgebras of GA. From the obtained update rule, it is shown how to recover the following least mean squares (LMS) AF variants via algebraic isomorphisms: real-entries LMS, complex LMS, and quaternions LMS. Mean-square analysis and simulations in a system identification scenario are provided, showing very good agreement. Real-data experiments highlight the good tracking performance of the GAAFs in a joint linear prediction of different signals.","citedby-count":"25","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008088","afid":"60008088","affilname":"Universidade de São Paulo","affiliation-city":"Sao Paulo","affiliation-country":"Brazil"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/122693424","afid":"122693424","affilname":"UpStride","affiliation-city":"Saint-Mande","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/47061637100","authid":"47061637100","orcid":"0000-0003-3291-7465","authname":"Lopes W.B.","surname":"Lopes","given-name":"Wilder Bezerra","initials":"W.B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"122693424"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56282545100","authid":"56282545100","orcid":"0000-0001-6777-1529","authname":"Lopes C.G.","surname":"Lopes","given-name":"Cassio Guimaraes","initials":"C.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008088"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive filtering | geometric algebra | quaternions","article-number":"8712440","source-id":"17391","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85042933458"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85042933458?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85042933458&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85042933458&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85042933458","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85042933458","eid":"2-s2.0-85042933458","dc:title":"Root-Power Mean Aggregation-Based Neuron in Quaternionic Domain","dc:creator":"Kumar S.","prism:publicationName":"IETE Journal of Research","prism:issn":"03772063","prism:eIssn":"0974780X","prism:volume":"65","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"557-575","prism:coverDate":"2019-07-04","prism:coverDisplayDate":"4 July 2019","prism:doi":"10.1080/03772063.2018.1436473","dc:description":"This paper illustrates the new structure of artificial neuron based on root-power mean (RPM) aggregation for quaternionic-valued signals and also presented an efficient learning process of neural networks with quaternionic-valued RPM neurons.

The proposed radial Laguerre invariants retain the basic form of disc-based moments, such as Zernike moments, pseudo-Zernike moments, Fourier-Mellin moments, and so on. Therefore, the rotation invariants of radial associated Laguerre moments can be easily obtained. In addition, we have also extended the proposed moments and invariants using the algebra of quaternion to avoid losing some significant color information.

In order to realize the high precision earth observation and stereo imaging in the same orbit, the earth observation satellite needs to have the ability of fast attitude maneuver and stabilization. The satellite needs to have the ability of fast attitude maneuver to track the target. In order to realize the fast attitude maneuver of agile satellite, the Pentagon configuration composed of six SGCMGs is used as the attitude control actuator. In order to shorten the time required for attitude maneuver of satellite, the angular trajectory of attitude maneuver around Euler axis is planned, and the error quaternion between the actual attitude and the planned attitude of satellite is calculated. Variable structure control law is designed with error angular velocity. The simulation results show that the control law designed in this paper can effectively complete the attitude maneuver around the Euler axis and has strong robustness.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073699","afid":"60073699","affilname":"China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57207884357","authid":"57207884357","authname":"Jian L.","surname":"Jian","given-name":"Liang","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073699"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57213195531","authid":"57213195531","authname":"Yang Z.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Zhao","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073699"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57213194356","authid":"57213194356","authname":"Hefen Z.","surname":"Hefen","given-name":"Zhang","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073699"}]}],"authkeywords":"Agile satellite | SGCMG | variable structure control law","article-number":"8898569","source-id":"82000","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077682192"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077682192?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077682192&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077682192&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077682192","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85077682192","eid":"2-s2.0-85077682192","dc:title":"Reproducibility of Spectral and Radiometric Normalized Similarity Indices for Multiband Images","dc:creator":"Arienzo A.","prism:publicationName":"International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538691540"}],"prism:pageRange":"839-842","prism:coverDate":"2019-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2019","prism:doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8898662","dc:description":"Several tasks of remote sensing entail the measurement of the similarity/dissimilarity of a test multiband image to a reference multiband image. To this purpose, several indices has been developed over the last two decades. The most widely used indices are normalized to avoid dependence on the data format. In this work, we will focus on such indices and provide a novel insight on their behaviors. Spectral indices are those performing crossed measurements between couple of different bands of the test and reference image. Wherever crossed measurements do not occur, the index is purely spatial, or better radiometric. Both theoretical insights and simulations performed on a GeoEye dataset, with the products of twelve pansharpening methods, show that their performance ranking does not depend on the data format for purely radiometric indices, while it significantly depends on the data format, either spectral radiance or digital numbers (DN), for a purely spectral index, like the spectral angle mapper (SAM). The dependence on the data format is weak for indices that balance the spectral and radiometric similarity, like the family of indices, Q2n, based on hypercomplex algebra.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021859","afid":"60021859","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Firenze","affiliation-city":"Florence","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002838","afid":"60002838","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Siena","affiliation-city":"Siena","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002324","afid":"60002324","affilname":"Istituto Di Fisica Applicata Nello Carrara","affiliation-city":"Florence","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205199602","authid":"57205199602","authname":"Arienzo A.","surname":"Arienzo","given-name":"Alberto","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021859"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002324"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005912959","authid":"7005912959","authname":"Alparone L.","surname":"Alparone","given-name":"Luciano","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021859"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004905120","authid":"7004905120","authname":"Aiazzi B.","surname":"Aiazzi","given-name":"Bruno","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002324"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56962582100","authid":"56962582100","authname":"Baronti S.","surname":"Baronti","given-name":"Stefano","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002324"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004594292","authid":"7004594292","authname":"Garzelli A.","surname":"Garzelli","given-name":"Andrea","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002838"}]}],"authkeywords":"Multiband images | Pansharpening | Remote sensing data formats | Statistical quality indices","article-number":"8898662","source-id":"82000","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073210508"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073210508?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073210508&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073210508&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073210508","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85073210508","eid":"2-s2.0-85073210508","dc:title":"Deep Cyclic Group Networks","dc:creator":"Fan Z.C.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781728119854"}],"prism:volume":"2019-July","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2019-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2019","prism:doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2019.8851695","dc:description":"We propose a new network architecture called deep cyclic group network (DCGN) that uses the cyclic group algebra for convolutional vector-neuron learning. The input to DCGN is a three-way tensor, where the mode-3 dimension corresponds to the dimensionality of the input data, e.g., three for RGB images. To handle vector-valued inputs, we replace scalar multiplication with circular convolution for the feedforward and backpropagation processes. As a result, every feature map and kernel map is a three-way tensor with the same mode-3 dimension as the input data. This way, DCGN may capture more of the relations among different data dimensions, especially for regression tasks where the target output has the same dimensionality as the input data. Moreover, DCGN can deal with input data of arbitrary dimensions, a property that existing architectures such as deep complex networks and deep quaternion networks (DQN) lack. Experiments show that DCGN indeed performs better than convolutional neural networks and DQN for two regression tasks, namely color image inpainting and multispectral image denoising.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60113260","afid":"60113260","affilname":"Academia Sinica, Research Center for Information Technology Innovation","affiliation-city":"Taipei","affiliation-country":"Taiwan"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005429","afid":"60005429","affilname":"National Taiwan University","affiliation-city":"Taipei","affiliation-country":"Taiwan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56939651100","authid":"56939651100","authname":"Fan Z.C.","surname":"Fan","given-name":"Zhe Cheng","initials":"Z.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60113260"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005429"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55451052500","authid":"55451052500","authname":"Chan T.S.","surname":"Chan","given-name":"Tak Shing","initials":"T.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60113260"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55218558400","authid":"55218558400","authname":"Yang Y.H.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Yi Hsuan","initials":"Y.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60113260"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402965041","authid":"7402965041","authname":"Jang J.S.R.","surname":"Jang","given-name":"Jyh Shing Roger","initials":"J.S.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005429"}]}],"authkeywords":"convolutional neural networks | deep cyclic group algebra | deep cyclic group networks | deep neural networks | vector neural learning","article-number":"8851695","source-id":"96537","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071888446"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071888446?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85071888446&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85071888446&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071888446","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85071888446","eid":"2-s2.0-85071888446","dc:title":"Novel Adaptive Fuzzy Extended Kalman Filter for Attitude Estimation in Gps-Denied Environment","dc:creator":"Ammar Assad ","prism:publicationName":"Gyroscopy and Navigation","prism:issn":"20751087","prism:eIssn":"20751109","prism:volume":"10","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"131-146","prism:coverDate":"2019-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 July 2019","prism:doi":"10.1134/S2075108719030027","dc:description":"Abstract—: This paper presents a Novel Adaptive Fuzzy Extended Kalman Filter namely (NAFEKF) which has been developed and applied for attitude estimation using only the outputs of strap-down IMU (Gyroscopes and Accelerometers) and strap-down magnetometer.

With the advent of deep learning, it is possible to predict the head pose accurately from the RGB images without the help of facial landmarks or depth information. However, existing head pose datasets often lack large pose head images, which extremely limits the development of head pose estimation algorithms. In this paper, we build the largescale head pose dataset (LHPD) including more than 140,000 images with the diverse and accurate head poses. The LHPD dataset includes the head images recorded from different shooting angles between the camera and the human body for the first time, which greatly expands the range of head pose compared to previous datasets. Therefore, the range of head pose can cover +/-90anddeg; for each Euler angle. The accurate and reliable head pose annotation is labeled by the motion capture system and careful calibration procedures. We then propose a head pose estimation method through fine-tuning the ResNet on the LHPD dataset when using the Euclidean distance of quaternions as the loss function. The results show that our method achieves better performance than current state-of-theart algorithms.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025084","afid":"60025084","affilname":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014966","afid":"60014966","affilname":"Peking University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57198850029","authid":"57198850029","authname":"Sun W.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193678272","authid":"57193678272","authname":"Fan Y.","surname":"Fan","given-name":"Yezhao","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56030205300","authid":"56030205300","authname":"Min X.","surname":"Min","given-name":"Xiongkuo","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57210579503","authid":"57210579503","authname":"Peng S.","surname":"Peng","given-name":"Shihao","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34872761500","authid":"34872761500","authname":"Ma S.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Siwei","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014966"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15847120000","authid":"15847120000","authname":"Zhai G.","surname":"Zhai","given-name":"Guangtao","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]}],"authkeywords":"Convolution nerual network | Facial landmark detection | Head pose dataset | Head pose estimation","article-number":"8784950","source-id":"20300195058","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61527804","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85069687395"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85069687395?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85069687395&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85069687395&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85069687395","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85069687395","eid":"2-s2.0-85069687395","dc:title":"Valuations on convex functions and convex sets and Monge-Ampère operators","dc:creator":"Alesker S.","prism:publicationName":"Advances in Geometry","prism:issn":"1615715X","prism:volume":"19","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"313-322","prism:coverDate":"2019-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 July 2019","prism:doi":"10.1515/advgeom-2018-0031","dc:description":"The notion of a valuation on convex bodies is very classical; valuations on a class of functions have been introduced and studied by M.

And local spatial information is also neglected. To address these problems, a robust color image descriptor local color directional quaternionic pattern (LCDQP) is proposed. In the descriptor, the color distance map (CDM) is generated in the RGB color space to capture the color distribution among three channels. According to the distribution of CDM elements and their neighbors, four edge models are defined to describe the change trend of the original image. Then, based on this, the LCDQP strings are gained according to the distribution of four models in the four directions of 0 deg, 45 deg, 90 deg, and 135 deg. Finally, an effective quaternionic code method is adopted to construct the LCDQP descriptor. The proposed descriptor not only captures the local color features but also reflects the spatial structure information. Experiments on four representative databases demonstrate that the proposed descriptor is superior to other state-of-the-art approaches.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025881","afid":"60025881","affilname":"Henan Polytechnic University","affiliation-city":"Jiaozuo","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35757184200","authid":"35757184200","authname":"Zhao S.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Shan","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025881"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57196289395","authid":"57196289395","authname":"Liu J.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Jing","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025881"}]}],"authkeywords":"image descriptor | local binary pattern | local color directional quaternionic pattern","article-number":"043003","source-id":"25978","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"18B520017","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherhybridgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Hybrid Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068918003"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068918003?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85068918003&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85068918003&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068918003","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85068918003","eid":"2-s2.0-85068918003","dc:title":"Deep learning-based pose estimation of apples for inspection in logistic centers using single-perspective imaging","dc:creator":"Giefer L.A.","prism:publicationName":"Processes","prism:eIssn":"22279717","prism:volume":"7","prism:issueIdentifier":"7","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2019-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 July 2019","prism:doi":"10.3390/pr7070424","dc:description":"Fruit packaging is a time-consuming task due to its low automation level. The gentle handling required by some kinds of fruits and their natural variations complicates the implementation of automated quality controls and tray positioning for final packaging. In this article, we propose a method for the automatic localization and pose estimation of apples captured by a Red-Green-Blue (RGB) camera using convolutional neural networks. Our pose estimation algorithm uses a cascaded structure composed of two independent convolutional neural networks: one for the localization of apples within the images and a second for the estimation of the three-dimensional rotation of the localized and cropped image area containing an apple. We used a single shot multi-box detector to find the bounding boxes of the apples in the images. Lie algebra is used for the regression of the rotation, which represents an innovation in this kind of application. We compare the performances of four different network architectures and show that this kind of representation is more suitable than using state-of-the-art quaternions. By using this method, we achieved a promising accuracy for the rotation regression of 98.36%, considering an error range lower than 15 degrees, forming a base for the automation of fruit packing systems.","citedby-count":"14","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008293","afid":"60008293","affilname":"Universität Bremen","affiliation-city":"Bremen","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209848215","authid":"57209848215","authname":"Giefer L.A.","surname":"Giefer","given-name":"Lino Antoni","initials":"L.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008293"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008293"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209851222","authid":"57209851222","orcid":"0000-0001-7431-9434","authname":"Castellanos J.D.A.","surname":"Castellanos","given-name":"Juan Daniel Arango","initials":"J.D.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008293"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209848373","authid":"57209848373","orcid":"0000-0002-3150-7184","authname":"Babr M.M.","surname":"Babr","given-name":"Mohammad Mohammadzadeh","initials":"M.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008293"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8616327000","authid":"8616327000","authname":"Freitag M.","surname":"Freitag","given-name":"Michael","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008293"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008293"}]}],"authkeywords":"Deep learning | Lie algebra | Logistic centers | Pose estimation | Quality inspection","article-number":"424","source-id":"21100838131","fund-acr":"BMWi","fund-no":"ZF4181406DB7","fund-sponsor":"Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065561909"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065561909?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85065561909&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85065561909&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0016003219302662"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065561909","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85065561909","eid":"2-s2.0-85065561909","dc:title":"Spacecraft output feedback attitude control based on extended state observer and adaptive dynamic programming","dc:creator":"Gong L.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of the Franklin Institute","prism:issn":"00160032","prism:volume":"356","prism:issueIdentifier":"10","prism:pageRange":"4971-5000","prism:coverDate":"2019-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2019","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jfranklin.2019.04.018","pii":"S0016003219302662","dc:description":"This paper investigates spacecraft output feedback attitude control problem based on extended state observer (ESO) and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) approach.

A quaternion covariance matrix (QCM) of input samples was constructed, and its eigenvectors were derived to find the solution of QPCA. However, eigen-decomposition leads to the fixed solution for the same input. This solution is susceptible to outliers and cannot be further optimized. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel quaternion ridge regression (QRR) model for two-dimensional QPCA (2D-QPCA). We mathematically prove that this QRR model is equivalent to the QCM model of 2D-QPCA. The QRR model is a general framework and is flexible to combine 2D-QPCA with other technologies or constraints to adapt different requirements of real-world applications. Including sparsity constraints, we then propose a quaternion sparse regression model for 2D-QSPCA to improve its robustness for classification. An alternating minimization algorithm is developed to iteratively learn the solution of 2D-QSPCA in the equivalent complex domain. In addition, 2D-QPCA and 2D-QSPCA can preserve the spatial structure of color images and have a low computation cost. Experiments on several challenging databases demonstrate that 2D-QPCA and 2D-QSPCA are effective in color face recognition, and 2D-QSPCA outperforms the state of the arts.","citedby-count":"43","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"pubmed-id":"30418886","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194871863","authid":"57194871863","orcid":"0000-0001-8827-3991","authname":"Xiao X.","surname":"Xiao","given-name":"Xiaolin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24175343600","authid":"24175343600","orcid":"0000-0002-4487-6384","authname":"Zhou Y.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Yicong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]}],"authkeywords":"2D-principle component analysis (2D-PCA) | 2D-quaternion PCA (2D-QPCA) | 2D-quaternion sparse PCA (2D-QSPCA) | color face recognition | feature extraction | partial occlusions | QPCA","article-number":"8525438","source-id":"21100235616","fund-acr":"CRCC","fund-no":"FDCT/189/2017/A3","fund-sponsor":"Cancer Research Coordinating Committee","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058399343"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058399343?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85058399343&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85058399343&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058399343","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85058399343","eid":"2-s2.0-85058399343","dc:title":"Construction of a new 2D Chebyshev-Sine map and its application to color image encryption","dc:creator":"Liu H.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","prism:issn":"13807501","prism:eIssn":"15737721","prism:volume":"78","prism:issueIdentifier":"12","prism:pageRange":"15997-16010","prism:coverDate":"2019-06-30","prism:coverDisplayDate":"30 June 2019","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11042-018-6996-z","dc:description":"A new 2D Chebyshev-Sine map with natural evaluation is proposed and its dynamical behavior is analyzed.

Quaternion theory is used to represent the intensity and chromaticity differences of two color pixels. Use of quaternion treats color pixels as vectors and processes color images as single unit rather than as separated color components. This preserves the existing correlation and three dimensional vector natures of the color channels. In the first stage of noise detection, the color pixels are sorted and assigned a rank based on the aggregated sum of color pixel differences with other pixels inside the filtering window. The central pixel is considered as probably corrupted by an impulse if its rank is bigger than a predefined rank. In the second stage, the probably corrupted candidate is again checked for an edge or an impulse by using four Laplacian convolution kernels. If the minimum difference of these four convolution is larger than a predefined threshold, then the central pixel is regarded as an impulse. For filtering, we extend the size of the sliding window to cover more pixels information. The noisy pixel is replaced by output of weighted vector median filter implemented using the quaternion distance. More weight is assigned to those pixels belonging to the direction of minimum difference. Experimental results indicate the improved performance of the proposed filter in suppressing the impulse noise while retaining the original image details comparing against other well-known filters.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60107385","afid":"60107385","affilname":"National Institute of Technology Nagaland","affiliation-city":"Dimapur","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60107383","afid":"60107383","affilname":"National Institute of Technology Manipur","affiliation-city":"Imphal","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57200826477","authid":"57200826477","authname":"Chanu P.R.","surname":"Chanu","given-name":"P.

The first one is a natural integral transform mapping isometrically the standard Hilbert space on the real line into the two-dimensional Bargmann–Fock space. It is obtained as a composition of the one- and two-dimensional Segal–Bargmann transforms and reduces further to an extreme integral operator that looks like a composition operator of the one-dimensional Segal–Bargmann transform with a specific symbol. We study its basic properties, including the identification of its image and the determination of a like-left inverse defined on the whole two-dimensional Bargmann–Fock space. We examine their combination with the Fourier transform which lead to special integral transforms connecting the two-dimensional Bargmann–Fock space and its analogue on the complex plane. We also investigate the relationship between special subspaces of the two-dimensional Bargmann–Fock space and the slice-hyperholomorphic one on the quaternions by introducing appropriate integral transforms. We identify their image and their action on the reproducing kernel.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000784","afid":"60000784","affilname":"Faculté des Sciences Rabat","affiliation-city":"Rabat","affiliation-country":"Morocco"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202712454","authid":"57202712454","authname":"Benahmadi A.","surname":"Benahmadi","given-name":"Abdelhadi","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000784"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56768051400","authid":"56768051400","authname":"Diki K.","surname":"Diki","given-name":"Kamal","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000784"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55993949700","authid":"55993949700","orcid":"0000-0003-0764-5576","authname":"Ghanmi A.","surname":"Ghanmi","given-name":"Allal","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000784"}]}],"authkeywords":"32A10 | Bargmann–Fock space | I.
