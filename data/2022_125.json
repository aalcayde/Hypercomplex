However, such signals captured in a mobile scenario would be susceptible to noise from the surrounding environment. Pupil size data also consist of missing data due to blinks. In addition to pupil size, researchers have suggested including multimodal information such as gaze and head movements for enhanced monitoring cognitive and neural activities. Multichannel signal processing is required for the simultaneous processing of these signals, while their mutual relations are exploited. This paper explores a novel multichannel signal processing technique, quaternion singular spectrum analysis (QSSA), for processing eye-movement data, which include pupil diameter and gaze positions. The performance based on real data is compared with traditional methods. This is a novel application of QSSA in processing eye movement data for mobile health.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025192","afid":"60025192","affilname":"Hong Kong Metropolitan University","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017919","afid":"60017919","affilname":"The Education University of Hong Kong","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007155","afid":"60007155","affilname":"Guangdong University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193616622","authid":"57193616622","authname":"Hung K.","surname":"Hung","given-name":"Kevin","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025192"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58127278500","authid":"58127278500","authname":"Man G.M.T.","surname":"Man","given-name":"Gary Man Tat","initials":"G.M.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025192"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55975707100","authid":"55975707100","authname":"Chui J.K.T.","surname":"Chui","given-name":"John Kwok Tai","initials":"J.K.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025192"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7103203940","authid":"7103203940","authname":"Chow D.H.K.","surname":"Chow","given-name":"Daniel Hung Kay","initials":"D.H.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017919"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57210406493","authid":"57210406493","authname":"Ling B.W.K.","surname":"Ling","given-name":"Bingo Wing Kuen","initials":"B.W.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007155"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15844364500","authid":"15844364500","authname":"Pun S.H.","surname":"Pun","given-name":"Sio Hang","initials":"S.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]}],"authkeywords":"Health Monitoring | Mobile Health | Multichannel Signal Processing | Pupillary Dynamics | Quaternion Singular Spectrum Analysis","source-id":"21101138613","fund-acr":"研究資助局","fund-no":"UGCFDS1/ 6E/ 15/21","fund-sponsor":"Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85148082038"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85148082038?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85148082038&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85148082038&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85148082038","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85148082038","eid":"2-s2.0-85148082038","dc:title":"WOVEN K-FRAMES IN QUATERNIONIC HILBERT SPACES","dc:creator":"Sharma N.","prism:publicationName":"Poincare Journal of Analysis and Applications","prism:issn":"23496789","prism:eIssn":"23496797","prism:volume":"9","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"377-398","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","dc:description":"In this paper, we have defined and studied woven K-frames in quaternionic Hilbert spaces.

The control law is built on a PID controller that has been tuned with SA method. The control signal will be close to an identical comparable control, and the system state will continue to be in a reference attitude. A trajectory controller controls the reference attitude and steers the vehicle along a predetermined path. The reference vectors for the attitude controller are provided by the trajectory controller and navigation system collectively. To assure the system's efficacy, the Simulated Annealing tuned PID (SA PID) controller is compared with Proportional Integral (PI), Proportional Derivative (PD), and Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controllers. When constructing the feedback controller, the structural parametric uncertainties and environmental turbulences are taken into consideration. The sensitivity of the system is evaluated using distinctive thrust torque profiles. Using a Pulse-Width-Pulse-Frequency (PWPF) modulator, the attitude controller modifies the thrust torque delivered at the vehicle.

We employ a multi-stage regression strategy. To overcome the discontinuity of Euler angles and quaternions and avoid the additional constraints required to directly regress the rotation matrix, we apply a continuous 6D representation to the head pose estimation problem. Each stage of the network regresses two 1×3 vectors, which are then transformed into a 3 × 3 rotation matrix by this continuous 6D representation. To better perceive the difference in rotation angles, we adopt the Riemann distance to measure the closeness between the network-estimated rotation matrix and the ground truth rotation matrix corresponding to the head pose. Experiments show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art on BIWI dataset and performs favorably on AFLW2000 dataset.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60102437","afid":"60102437","affilname":"China Academy of Space Technology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018308","afid":"60018308","affilname":"Xi'an Jiaotong University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57224530891","authid":"57224530891","authname":"Liu Y.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Yinchuan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018308"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58075323500","authid":"58075323500","authname":"Gong Y.","surname":"Gong","given-name":"Yufei","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018308"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/53881585000","authid":"53881585000","authname":"Lu Z.","surname":"Lu","given-name":"Zheng","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102437"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16032700200","authid":"16032700200","authname":"Zhang X.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xuetao","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018308"}]}],"authkeywords":"6D rotation representation | Head pose estimation | multi-stage regression | Riemann distance","source-id":"144684","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85146687526"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85146687526?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85146687526&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85146687526&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85146687526","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85146687526","eid":"2-s2.0-85146687526","dc:title":"Quaternion Convolutional Neural Networks for Depth Estimation","dc:creator":"Nguyen A.H.","prism:publicationName":"2022 Joint 12th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems and 23rd International Symposium on Advanced Intelligent Systems, SCIS and ISIS 2022","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781665499248"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/SCISISIS55246.2022.10002074","dc:description":"Depth Estimation is the task of measuring the distance of each pixel relative to the camera.

The fundamental challenge for automatically detecting fabric damage, in most cases, is the complex structure of the textile. Obviously, fabric inspection has an importance to prevent the risk of delivering inferior quality product. This article presents a two-stage approach, combining novel and traditional algorithms, to image segmentation and defect detection. The first stage is a new method for segmenting fabric images is based on Hamiltonian quaternions and the associative algebra and the active contour model with anisotropic gradient. To solve the problem of loss of important information about color, saturation, and other important information associated color, we use the quaternion framework to represent a color image to consider all three channels simultaneously when segmenting the RGB image. In the second stage, our crack and damage detection method are based on a convolutional autoencoder (U-Net) and deep feature fusion network (DFFN-Net). This solution allows localizing defects with higher accuracy compared to traditional methods of machine learning and modern methods of deep learning. All experiments were carried out using a public database with examples of damage to the TILDA fabric dataset.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032982","afid":"60032982","affilname":"Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation","affiliation-city":"Moscow","affiliation-country":"Russian Federation"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014196","afid":"60014196","affilname":"Moscow State Technological University Stankin","affiliation-city":"Moscow","affiliation-country":"Russian Federation"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56157757100","authid":"56157757100","authname":"Sizyakin R.","surname":"Sizyakin","given-name":"R.","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014196"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55802371401","authid":"55802371401","authname":"Voronin V.","surname":"Voronin","given-name":"V.","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014196"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56157301500","authid":"56157301500","authname":"Gapon N.","surname":"Gapon","given-name":"N.","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014196"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56572834900","authid":"56572834900","authname":"Semenishchev E.","surname":"Semenishchev","given-name":"E.","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014196"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193489919","authid":"57193489919","authname":"Shakhramanyan M.","surname":"Shakhramanyan","given-name":"M.","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032982"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204649388","authid":"57204649388","authname":"Zelensky A.","surname":"Zelensky","given-name":"A.","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014196"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36544752200","authid":"36544752200","authname":"Ilyukhin Y.","surname":"Ilyukhin","given-name":"Yu","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014196"}]}],"authkeywords":"deep learning | fabric defects detection | fabric image inspection | image enhancement | neural network","article-number":"1231922","source-id":"40067","fund-no":"FSFS-2021-0004","fund-sponsor":"SI Organization","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85146489315"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85146489315?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85146489315&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85146489315&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85146489315","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85146489315","eid":"2-s2.0-85146489315","dc:title":"Image-Based Visual Servoing of a Fully-Actuated Hexacopter","dc:creator":"Zhang X.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of 2022 IEEE International Conference on Unmanned Systems, ICUS 2022","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781665484565"}],"prism:pageRange":"1587-1592","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICUS55513.2022.9986822","dc:description":"In this paper, a novel image-based visual servoing (IBVS) approach is proposed for a fully-actuated hexacopter, which allows to maintain a stable attitude with the horizontal movement.

Specifically, the nonlinear hierarchical position and attitude controller is designed based on its dynamic characteristics. In the outer loop, an new IBVS method with perspective moments is employed to design the force input. The inner loop utilizes the quaternion to generate the torque input.

The high precision, high stability and fast maneuverability of satellite formation attitude coordination control are the prerequisites to maintain this configuration. Based on the directed communication topology, this paper will study the satellite formation attitude cooperative control problem. Quaternions are used to describe the relative kinematics and dynamic equations of formation satellites. The application of algebraic graph theory in the communication of satellite formation members is studied, and the topological structure of directed communication among formation members is described based on this theoretical basis. Considering the state retention and formation retention of satellite formations at the same time, three sliding mode controllers are designed. Firstly, a sliding mode controller with a symbolic function control law is designed. The simulation results show that there is a severe jitter phenomenon under the influence of external disturbance torque. A saturated function sliding mode controller is further designed, and the high frequency jitter is effectively suppressed. Finally, in order to improve the rapid maneuverability of the formation satellites, a limited-time attitude cooperative controller is designed based on the fast terminal sliding mode theory, which significantly shortens the maneuvering time.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/128201854","afid":"128201854","affilname":"Shanghai Key Laboratory of Aerospace","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58042625600","authid":"58042625600","authname":"Hu W.","surname":"Hu","given-name":"Wenkun","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"128201854"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58042915200","authid":"58042915200","authname":"Chen X.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Xiumei","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"128201854"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201798116","authid":"57201798116","authname":"Pei J.","surname":"Pei","given-name":"Jiarui","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"128201854"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57213705107","authid":"57213705107","authname":"Chen H.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Han","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"128201854"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201802306","authid":"57201802306","authname":"Guo S.","surname":"Guo","given-name":"Siyan","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"128201854"}]}],"authkeywords":"attitude cooperative control | directed communication topology | satellite formation flight | sliding mode control","source-id":"21101130442","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85145211954"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85145211954?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85145211954&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85145211954&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85145211954","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85145211954","eid":"2-s2.0-85145211954","dc:title":"Video Segmentation on Static and Dynamic Textures Using a Quaternion Framework","dc:creator":"Zelensky A.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","prism:issn":"0277786X","prism:eIssn":"1996756X","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781510655553"}],"prism:volume":"12276","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1117/12.2641697","dc:description":"This paper presents a new method for video segmentation using deep learning neural networks in the quaternion space into sets of objects, background, static and dynamic textures. We introduce a novel quaternionic anisotropic gradient (QAG) which can combine the color channels and the orientations in the image plane. The local polynomial estimates and the ICI rule are used for QAG calculation. Since for segmentation tasks, the image is usually converted to grayscale, this leads to the loss of important information about color, saturation, and other important information associated color. To solve this problem, we use the quaternion framework to represent a color image to consider all three channels simultaneously when segmenting the RGB image. Using the QAGs, we extract the local orientation information in the color images. Second, to improve the segmentation result we applied neural network to this derived orientation information. The presented new approach allows obtaining clearer and more detailed boundaries of objects of interest. Experimental comparisons to state-of-the-art video segmentation methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014196","afid":"60014196","affilname":"Moscow State Technological University Stankin","affiliation-city":"Moscow","affiliation-country":"Russian Federation"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204649388","authid":"57204649388","authname":"Zelensky A.","surname":"Zelensky","given-name":"A.","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014196"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55802371401","authid":"55802371401","authname":"Voronin V.","surname":"Voronin","given-name":"V.","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014196"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58036763000","authid":"58036763000","authname":"Zhdanova M.","surname":"Zhdanova","given-name":"M.","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014196"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57780777500","authid":"57780777500","authname":"Siryakov A.","surname":"Siryakov","given-name":"A.","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014196"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57768275500","authid":"57768275500","authname":"Egipko V.","surname":"Egipko","given-name":"V.","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014196"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211035058","authid":"57211035058","authname":"Urunov S.","surname":"Urunov","given-name":"S.","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014196"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56572834900","authid":"56572834900","authname":"Semenishchev E.","surname":"Semenishchev","given-name":"E.","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014196"}]}],"authkeywords":"anisotropic gradient | quaternion framework | static and dynamic textures | video segmentation","article-number":"122760M","source-id":"40067","fund-acr":"RSF","fund-no":"21-79-10392","fund-sponsor":"Russian Science Foundation","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85145183472"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85145183472?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85145183472&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85145183472&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85145183472","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85145183472","eid":"2-s2.0-85145183472","dc:title":"Visual Localization Based on Deep Learning - Take Southern Branch of the National Palace Museum for Example","dc:creator":"Tu C.H.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783031217425"}],"prism:volume":"13757 LNAI","prism:pageRange":"39-50","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-21743-2_4","dc:description":"Visual localization uses images to regress camera position and orientation.

Recently, hypercomplex linear layers have been further improved by involving efficient parameterized Kronecker products. In this article, we define the parameterization of hypercomplex convolutional layers and introduce the family of parameterized hypercomplex neural networks (PHNNs) that are lightweight and efficient large-scale models. Our method grasps the convolution rules and the filter organization directly from data without requiring a rigidly predefined domain structure to follow. PHNNs are flexible to operate in any user-defined or tuned domain, from 1-D to <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$n$</tex-math> </inline-formula>D regardless of whether the algebra rules are preset. Such a malleability allows processing multidimensional inputs in their natural domain without annexing further dimensions, as done, instead, in quaternion neural networks (QNNs) for 3-D inputs like color images. As a result, the proposed family of PHNNs operates with <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1/n$</tex-math> </inline-formula> free parameters as regards its analog in the real domain. We demonstrate the versatility of this approach to multiple domains of application by performing experiments on various image datasets and audio datasets in which our method outperforms real and quaternion-valued counterparts.

Pose or motion priors are important for generating realistic new poses and for reconstructing accurate poses from noisy or partial observations. Pose-NDF learns a manifold of plausible poses as the zero level set of a neural implicit function, extending the idea of modeling implicit surfaces in 3D to the high-dimensional domain SO(3 ) K, where a human pose is defined by a single data point, represented by K quaternions. The resulting high-dimensional implicit function can be differentiated with respect to the input poses and thus can be used to project arbitrary poses onto the manifold by using gradient descent on the set of 3-dimensional hyperspheres. In contrast to previous VAE-based human pose priors, which transform the pose space into a Gaussian distribution, we model the actual pose manifold, preserving the distances between poses. We demonstrate that Pose-NDF outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods as a prior in various downstream tasks, ranging from denoising real-world human mocap data, pose recovery from occluded data to 3D pose reconstruction from images. Furthermore, we show that it can be used to generate more diverse poses by random sampling and projection than VAE-based methods. We will release our code and pre-trained model for further research at https://virtualhumans.mpi-inf.mpg.de/posendf/.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017246","afid":"60017246","affilname":"Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen","affiliation-city":"Tubingen","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000256","afid":"60000256","affilname":"Max Planck Institute for Informatics","affiliation-city":"Saarbrucken","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/128580502","afid":"128580502","affilname":"Meta Reality Labs Research","affiliation-city":"Sausalito","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189323596","authid":"57189323596","authname":"Tiwari G.","surname":"Tiwari","given-name":"Garvita","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017246"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57551129400","authid":"57551129400","authname":"Antić D.","surname":"Antić","given-name":"Dimitrije","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017246"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193505421","authid":"57193505421","authname":"Lenssen J.E.","surname":"Lenssen","given-name":"Jan Eric","initials":"J.E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56373778200","authid":"56373778200","authname":"Sarafianos N.","surname":"Sarafianos","given-name":"Nikolaos","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"128580502"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8649992500","authid":"8649992500","authname":"Tung T.","surname":"Tung","given-name":"Tony","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"128580502"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36106314300","authid":"36106314300","authname":"Pons-Moll G.","surname":"Pons-Moll","given-name":"Gerard","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017246"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000256"}]}],"source-id":"25674","fund-acr":"DFG","fund-no":"409792180","fund-sponsor":"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85143827168"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85143827168?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85143827168&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85143827168&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85143827168","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85143827168","eid":"2-s2.0-85143827168","dc:title":"2022 12th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering, ICCKE 2022","prism:publicationName":"2022 12th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering, ICCKE 2022","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781665476133"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 84 papers.

On the other hand, the processing speed in machine learning (ML) methods may not be acceptable, especially for real-Time implementations. In other words, the more accurate a signal is, the more latency can occur. Recently, echo state networks (ESN) have shown appropriate precession in signal processing and classifying variables. However, utilization of a reservoir layer affects their speed, particularly for high-dimensional data. This paper presents a powerful ESN method for pattern recognition and classification of complex phenomena based on a new octonion ESN called octonion nonlinear ESN (ONESN). This method includes a modified version of the conventional ESN, in which all computations from the real space are mapped to the octonion space. Consequently, the size of the reservoir and its weights are reduced to 1/8 of its initial amount, increasing the speed of processing. Also, a bilinear filter to improve the performance of the conventional ESN is added to the output of the network.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003263","afid":"60003263","affilname":"University of West Bohemia","affiliation-city":"Plzen","affiliation-country":"Czech Republic"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001619","afid":"60001619","affilname":"University of Kurdistan","affiliation-city":"Sanandaj","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57317975000","authid":"57317975000","authname":"Jamshidi M.B.","surname":"Jamshidi","given-name":"Mohammad Behdad","initials":"M.B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003263"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35078447100","authid":"35078447100","authname":"Daneshfar F.","surname":"Daneshfar","given-name":"Fatemeh","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001619"}]}],"authkeywords":"Artificial intelligence | big data | classification | deep learning machine learning | ESN | octonion algebra | pattern recognition","source-id":"21101125500","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85143739581"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85143739581?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85143739581&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85143739581&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85143739581","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85143739581","eid":"2-s2.0-85143739581","dc:title":"Recurrent Neural Network for Nine-Axis IMU-Based Orientation Estimation: 3D Orientation Estimation Performance in Disturbed Conditions","dc:creator":"Choi J.S.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems","prism:issn":"19765622","prism:volume":"28","prism:issueIdentifier":"12","prism:pageRange":"1216-1223","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.5302/J.ICROS.2022.22.0127","dc:description":"The estimation of 3D orientation based on nine-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) is an essential technology in various applications, from unmanned aerial vehicle to human motion tracking. Various sensor fusion filter algorithms such as Kalman filter (KF) or complementary filter (CF) have been proposed for accurate 3D orientation estimation. However, the degradation of estimation performance due to disturbance components such as magnetic distortion and external acceleration is still a critical issue. An alternative approach for the orientation estimation task is to train a neural network end-to-end with a variety of massive experimental datasets consisting of the raw IMU signals and the ground truth orientations. This paper proposes a recurrent neural network (RNN) for robust IMU-based 3D orientation estimation. Overall, this paper is an extension of the previous work by Weber et al., where the RNN model was used to estimate the quaternion, but only the attitude estimation performance was investigated without considering the heading estimation. The proposed RNN receives a nine-dimensional sensor signal as an input and outputs a unit quaternion representing 3D orientation, and it can robustly estimate the orientation across various motion characteristics and magnetic environments without needing an additional filter algorithm. Verification results showed that the proposed method outperformed the conventional CF and KF algorithms. In particular, in magnetically disturbed conditions, the averaged root mean square error of the proposed RNN approach was reduced by 41.4% and 60.3%, respectively, when compared to the CF and the KF algorithm.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073748","afid":"60073748","affilname":"Hankyong National University","affiliation-city":"Anseong","affiliation-country":"South Korea"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57445391900","authid":"57445391900","orcid":"0000-0002-9514-2129","authname":"Choi J.S.","surname":"Choi","given-name":"Ji Seok","initials":"J.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073748"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57032175000","authid":"57032175000","orcid":"0000-0003-0288-157X","authname":"Lee J.K.","surname":"Lee","given-name":"Jung Keun","initials":"J.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073748"}]}],"authkeywords":"3D orientation estimation | disturbed conditions | inertial measurement unit | recurrent neural network","source-id":"21100201073","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85143614063"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85143614063?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85143614063&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85143614063&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85143614063","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85143614063","eid":"2-s2.0-85143614063","dc:title":"SRNet: Structural Relation-aware Network for Head Pose Estimation","dc:creator":"Zeng Z.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - International Conference on Pattern Recognition","prism:issn":"10514651","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781665490627"}],"prism:volume":"2022-August","prism:pageRange":"826-832","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICPR56361.2022.9956106","dc:description":"Estimating head pose from a single RGB image has recently attracted considerable research attention. Prior arts employ a CNN backbone to process face images and then directly output Euler angles. We argue that they may ignore essential features that are highly correlated to head pose due to the non-global perspective, and the ambiguity and discontinuity issues of Euler angles representation could interfere with the performance of challenging samples. In this paper, we formulate the head pose estimation problem into quaternion representation space and propose a novel framework named Structural Relation-aware Network (SRNet). Different from previous methods, our SRNet explicitly explores the correlation among different regions of the face for mining global facial structure information. Furthermore, in order to boost robustness and generalization of the model, a hard example mining (HEM) strategy is designed to mitigate the data imbalance issue by adjusting the contributions of examples in different states to loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art alternatives on the public benchmark datasets: AFLW2000 and BIWI.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60105232","afid":"60105232","affilname":"ShanghaiTech University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027363","afid":"60027363","affilname":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020880","afid":"60020880","affilname":"Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57998465700","authid":"57998465700","authname":"Zeng Z.","surname":"Zeng","given-name":"Zhaoxiang","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020880"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191520969","authid":"57191520969","authname":"Zhu D.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Dongchen","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020880"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209217821","authid":"57209217821","authname":"Zhang G.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Guanghui","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020880"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201482301","authid":"57201482301","authname":"Shi W.","surname":"Shi","given-name":"Wenjun","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020880"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57218547442","authid":"57218547442","authname":"Wang L.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Lei","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020880"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56245909000","authid":"56245909000","authname":"Zhang X.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xiaolin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020880"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60105232"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57196156585","authid":"57196156585","authname":"Li J.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Jiamao","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020880"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"}]}],"source-id":"24282","fund-acr":"CAS","fund-no":"2018SHZDZX01","fund-sponsor":"Chinese Academy of Sciences","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85142755925"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85142755925?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85142755925&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85142755925&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85142755925","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85142755925","eid":"2-s2.0-85142755925","dc:title":"Proceedings of 2022 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition, ICWAPR 2022","prism:publicationName":"International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","prism:issn":"21585695","prism:eIssn":"21585709","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781665488358"}],"prism:volume":"2022-September","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 16 papers.

The main contribution of this work is to introduce WVD and ambiguity function (AF) associated with the QOLCT (WVD-QOLCT/AF-QOLCT). First, the definition of the WVD-QOLCT is proposed, and then several important properties such as dilation, nonlinearity, and boundedness are derived. Second, we derived the AF for the proposed transform. A bunch of important properties, including the reconstruction formula associated with the AF, are studied.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60117095","afid":"60117095","affilname":"Symbiosis Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Pune","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60115213","afid":"60115213","affilname":"Islamic University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Awantipora","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027741","afid":"60027741","affilname":"King Khalid University","affiliation-city":"Abha","affiliation-country":"Saudi Arabia"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56747301000","authid":"56747301000","authname":"Bhat M.Y.","surname":"Bhat","given-name":"Mohammad Younus","initials":"M.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60115213"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36607351400","authid":"36607351400","authname":"Almanjahie I.M.","surname":"Almanjahie","given-name":"Ibrahim M.","initials":"I.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027741"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221082109","authid":"57221082109","authname":"Dar A.H.","surname":"Dar","given-name":"Aamir H.","initials":"A.H."},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57214643199","authid":"57214643199","authname":"Dar J.G.","surname":"Dar","given-name":"Javid G.","initials":"J.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60117095"}]}],"authkeywords":"ambiguity function | dilation | quaternion algebra | quaternion offset linear canonical transform | Wigner-Ville distribution","source-id":"21100836176","fund-acr":"KKU","fund-no":"R.G.P.2/132/43","fund-sponsor":"King Khalid University","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85142229425"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85142229425?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85142229425&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85142229425&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85142229425","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85142229425","eid":"2-s2.0-85142229425","dc:title":"Point Cloud Registration with Low Overlap Based on Dimension Reduction and Feature Matching","dc:creator":"Xu F.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Advanced Information Technology, Electronic and Automation Control Conference (IAEAC)","prism:issn":"26896621","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781665458641"}],"prism:volume":"2022-October","prism:pageRange":"483-488","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/IAEAC54830.2022.9929679","dc:description":"In the process of point cloud registration with low overlap, existing algorithms have a series of problems of computational complexity and time cost. In order to improve the speed and precision of registration, this paper proposed a method based on dimension reduction and feature matching. Firstly, 3d disordered points in point cloud are transformed into 2d images by projection, where the principal component analysis (PCA) is used to calculate the original projection direction and the perception hash algorithm is used to correct it; Secondly feature extraction and matching are completed in the image space, which sharply decrease the time cost. And unreliable matches are filtered out based on voting rules and distance invariance of the rigid body transformation, which ensure the precision of registration. Finally, transformation matrix is calculated according to the quaternion method, and ICP is used to iteratively calculate the optimization results. The public point cloud data and physical model point cloud data are used as samples in experiments, and the experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve a highly precise registration with an overlap rate as low as 30%. The time cost is reduced by more than 160% compared with the existing algorithms, and speed superiority of the proposed method is more significant with the increase of data scale.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005244","afid":"60005244","affilname":"Southeast University","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57972419800","authid":"57972419800","authname":"Xu F.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Feifan","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191654373","authid":"57191654373","authname":"Zhou Y.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Yijun","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/37070836500","authid":"37070836500","authname":"Luo C.","surname":"Luo","given-name":"Chen","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]}],"authkeywords":"dimension reduction | feature matching | low overlap | point cloud registration | quaternion method","source-id":"21101047185","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"BE2020020","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85141805291"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85141805291?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85141805291&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85141805291&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85141805291","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85141805291","eid":"2-s2.0-85141805291","dc:title":"Automatic Color Image Stitching Using Quaternion Rank-1 Alignment","dc:creator":"Li J.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","prism:issn":"10636919","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781665469463"}],"prism:volume":"2022-June","prism:pageRange":"19688-19697","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/CVPR52688.2022.01910","dc:description":"Color image stitching is a challenging task in real-world applications. This paper first proposes a quaternion rank-1 alignment (QR1A) model for high-precision color image alignment. To solve the optimization problem of QR1A, we develop a nested iterative algorithm under the framework of complex-valued alternating direction method of multipliers. To quantitatively evaluate image stitching performance, we propose a perceptual seam quality (PSQ) measure to calculate misalignments of local regions along the seamline. Using QR1A and PSQ, we further propose an automatic color image stitching (ACIS-QR1A) framework. In this frame-work, the automatic strategy and iterative learning strategy are developed to simultaneously learn the optimal seamline and local alignment. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed ACIS-QR1A is able to obtain high-quality stitched images under several difficult scenarios including large parallax, low textures, moving objects, large occlusions or/and their combinations.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57196160147","authid":"57196160147","authname":"Li J.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Jiaxue","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24175343600","authid":"24175343600","authname":"Zhou Y.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Yicong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]}],"authkeywords":"Computational photography | Low-level vision","source-id":"24212","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85141570332"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85141570332?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85141570332&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85141570332&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85141570332","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85141570332","eid":"2-s2.0-85141570332","dc:title":"A New Fractional-Order Augmented Quaternion-Valued Approach for Degradation Prognostics of Bearings Using Generalized Hamilton-Real Calculus","dc:creator":"Li Q.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","prism:issn":"00189456","prism:eIssn":"15579662","prism:volume":"71","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/TIM.2022.3218546","dc:description":"Accurate prediction of bearings degradation trajectories with multichannel or multidimensional data is critical for collaborative prognostics and health management (PHM) of rotating machines to guarantee the safety and reliability of operation, thereby reducing maintenance costs. In this article, a new fractional-order augmented quaternion-valued approach named augmented quaternion-valued least mean p-power (AQLMP) for degradation prognostics of rolling bearings based on multichannel run-to-failure signals is proposed under the framework of hypercomplex data, for the first time. The augmented fractional-order order quaternion statistics and smoothing logarithmic penalty (SLP) term are designed elaborately to capture complete fractional-order statistical information of hypercomplex data and time-variant model uncertainty in widely linear quaternion-domain. Meanwhile, the generalized Hamilton-real calculus (GHRC) is employed for solving the weight update problem of the proposed AQLMP algorithm. The effectiveness and availability of the proposed approach are validated using two run-to-failure datasets of rolling bearings, and promising prognostics performance is achieved when compared with recent state-of-the-art benchmarks.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015487","afid":"60015487","affilname":"Anhui Agricultural University","affiliation-city":"Hefei","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010953","afid":"60010953","affilname":"Donghua University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191695881","authid":"57191695881","orcid":"0000-0001-7170-4679","authname":"Li Q.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Qing","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015487"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57800278300","authid":"57800278300","orcid":"0000-0003-0645-2449","authname":"Ren Z.","surname":"Ren","given-name":"Zhida","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010953"}]}],"authkeywords":"Augmented quaternion least mean p-power (AQLMP) | degradation prognostics | generalized Hamilton-real calculus (GHRC) | rolling bearings | smoothing logarithmic penalty (SLP)","article-number":"3529711","source-id":"15361","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"RC412104","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85141011960"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85141011960?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85141011960&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85141011960&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85141011960","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85141011960","eid":"2-s2.0-85141011960","dc:title":"Binaural source localization using deep learning and head rotation information","dc:creator":"García-Barrios G.","prism:publicationName":"European Signal Processing Conference","prism:issn":"22195491","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789082797091"}],"prism:volume":"2022-August","prism:pageRange":"36-40","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","dc:description":"This work studies learning-based binaural sound source localization, under the influence of head rotation in reverberant conditions. Emphasis is on whether knowledge of head rotation can improve localization performance over the non-rotating case for the same acoustic scene. Simulations of binaural head signals of a static and rotating head were conducted, for 5 different rotation speeds and a wide range of reverberant conditions. Several convolutional recurrent neural network models were evaluated including a static head scenario, a model without rotation information, and distinct models differentiated on the way of manipulating the quaternions. The results were analyzed based on the direction-of-arrival error, and they show the importance of using quaternions as additional features, with the best localization accuracy obtained when using an additional convolutional branch that merges the features through addition or concatenation. Nevertheless, raw quaternion features presented lower performance than the static baseline model. Additionally, the study shows the importance of the analysis time window length when using information about head rotation.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028442","afid":"60028442","affilname":"Universidad Politécnica de Madrid","affiliation-city":"Madrid","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011170","afid":"60011170","affilname":"Tampere University","affiliation-city":"Tampere","affiliation-country":"Finland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57226886156","authid":"57226886156","authname":"García-Barrios G.","surname":"García-Barrios","given-name":"Guillermo","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028442"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205482495","authid":"57205482495","authname":"Krause D.A.","surname":"Krause","given-name":"Daniel Aleksander","initials":"D.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011170"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55354726000","authid":"55354726000","authname":"Politis A.","surname":"Politis","given-name":"Archontis","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011170"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14632356500","authid":"14632356500","authname":"Mesaros A.","surname":"Mesaros","given-name":"Annamaria","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011170"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25645918600","authid":"25645918600","authname":"Gutiérrez-Arriola J.M.","surname":"Gutiérrez-Arriola","given-name":"Juana M.","initials":"J.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028442"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004023505","authid":"7004023505","authname":"Fraile R.","surname":"Fraile","given-name":"Rubén","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028442"}]}],"authkeywords":"binaural sound source localization | deep neural networks | head rotation | quaternions","source-id":"21100204301","fund-acr":"UPM","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Universidad Politécnica de Madrid","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
