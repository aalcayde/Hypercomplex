The attitude is evaluated by a Kalman filter based solution using differential range measurements. The Kliman filter design includes as system states the quaternions and the angular velocities. The performance of the algorithm has been evaluated in a software simulation environment, composed of a space segment GPS constellation simulator, a receiver raw data measurements simulator, attitude and rate determination modules, and allows to investigate the performance limits of the different solution algorithms (from basic least squares to filtering techniques) under various simulated space environment conditions and dynamics. An important part of the work has concentrated in particular on the study and simulation of the effects of multipath, as seen by the receiver antennas in a reference spacecraft configuration. Multipath induced phase measurements errors have been obtained by an electromagnetic modeling tool simulating signal reflections and diffraction from a reconstructed spacecraft model. They were introduced in the simulator together with simulation of other typical receiver measurement error sources. Results show that the filtering process is able to significantly reduce the effects of measurements noise and also the effects of colored noise (multipath) when amfed with an accurate model of the spacecraft dynamics and of the main angular perturbations. A series of attitude test results is enclosed to show the achieved algorithm performance. Fitter results are compared to the standard least squares attitude solution under different conditions, and with the AOCS requirements of typical LEO satellite systems.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60086681","afid":"60086681","affilname":"LABEN S.p.A.","affiliation-city":"Milan","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023256","afid":"60023256","affilname":"Politecnico di Milano","affiliation-city":"Milan","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603707482","authid":"6603707482","authname":"Bernelli-Zazzera F.","surname":"Bernelli-Zazzera","given-name":"F.","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603851773","authid":"6603851773","authname":"Campana R.","surname":"Campana","given-name":"R.","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60086681"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8853857500","authid":"8853857500","authname":"Gottifredi F.","surname":"Gottifredi","given-name":"F.","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60086681"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602632836","authid":"6602632836","authname":"Marradi L.","surname":"Marradi","given-name":"L.","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60086681"}]}],"source-id":"12376","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0032410299"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0032410299?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0032410299&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0032410299&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0924271698000173"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0032410299","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0032410299","eid":"2-s2.0-0032410299","dc:title":"Statistical analysis of two 3-D registration and modeling strategies","dc:creator":"Jokinen O.","prism:publicationName":"ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","prism:issn":"09242716","prism:volume":"53","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"320-341","prism:coverDate":"1998-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 1998","prism:doi":"10.1016/S0924-2716(98)00017-3","pii":"S0924271698000173","dc:description":"The paper deals with the registration and modeling of multiple 3-D profile maps acquired from different viewpoints by light striping. We analyze the propagation of measurement and calibration errors to the registration parameters and further to the reconstructed model of the scene consisting of planar patches. The analysis is performed for two strategies. In the first strategy, the maps are registered simultaneously using the Levenberg-Marquardt method to update the registration parameters and the model computed afterwards while in the second one, the maps are registered sequentially against the model reconstructed up till then using the method of unit quaternions to update the registration parameters. Our statistical analysis thus combines the registration and modeling steps, and in registration, we determine the corresponding points either on the parametric domains of the maps or as closest points in 3-D using the information from the parametric domain to restrict the search for the closest points. We also point out the precise estimation of the covariance matrix of the solution given by the Levenberg-Marquardt method. We illustrate the results of our analysis with real data from a scale model of an urban area.","citedby-count":"16","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60103653","afid":"60103653","affilname":"Aalto University","affiliation-city":"Espoo","affiliation-country":"Finland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603028652","authid":"6603028652","authname":"Jokinen O.","surname":"Jokinen","given-name":"Olli","initials":"O.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60103653"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603963067","authid":"6603963067","authname":"Haggrén H.","surname":"Haggrén","given-name":"Henrik","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60103653"}]}],"authkeywords":"3-D | Error propagation | Light striping | Modeling | Registration","source-id":"29161","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0032320344"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0032320344?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0032320344&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0032320344&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0032320344","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0032320344","eid":"2-s2.0-0032320344","dc:title":"Line-photogrammetric mathematical model for the reconstruction of polyhedral objects","dc:creator":"van den Heuvel F.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","prism:issn":"0277786X","prism:volume":"3641","prism:pageRange":"60-71","prism:coverDate":"1998-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1998","dc:description":"Man-made objects often have a polyhedral shape. For polyhedral objects it is advantageous to use a line-photogrammetric approach, i.e. lines are observed in the images instead of points. A novel line-photogrammetric mathematical model is presented. This model is built from condition equations with image line observations and object parameters in the form of the coordinates of object points and the parameters of object planes. The use of plane parameters significantly simplifies the formulation of geometric constraints. Object line parameters are not included in the model. The duality of the point and plane representation in space is exploited and leads to linear equations for the computation of approximate values. Constraints on the parameters are used to eliminate the rank deficiency and to enforce geometric object constraints. The exterior orientation of the images is assumed to be approximately known. The rotation matrix is parametrized by a unit quaternion. The main advantages of the presented mathematical model are the use of image lines as observations and the way in which it facilitates the incorporation of all types of geometric object constraints. Furthermore, the model is free of singularities through a combination of over-parametrization and constraints. The least squares adjustment allows a rigorous assessment of the precision of the computed parameters and allows for statistical testing to detect possible errors in the observations and the constraints. Examples demonstrate the advantages of the proposed mathematical model and show the effects of the introduction of geometric constraints.","citedby-count":"40","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006288","afid":"60006288","affilname":"Delft University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Delft","affiliation-country":"Netherlands"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004005328","authid":"7004005328","authname":"van den Heuvel F.","surname":"van den Heuvel","given-name":"Frank A.","initials":"F.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006288"}]}],"source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0032308308"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0032308308?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0032308308&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0032308308&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0032308308","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0032308308","eid":"2-s2.0-0032308308","dc:title":"Problem of defining the Fourier transform of a colour image","dc:creator":"Sangwine S.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","prism:volume":"1","prism:pageRange":"171-175","prism:coverDate":"1998-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1998","dc:description":"A discrete two-dimensional Fourier transform based on quaternion (or hypercomplex) numbers allows colour images to be transformed as a whole, rather than as colour-separated components.

The Corning OCA Star Tracker Camera, developed by Corning OCA under contract to Lockheed Martin, has been incorporated into the attitude determination sensor suite for the Mars Surveyor Program (MSP) and the STARDUST program. The Star Tracker Camera design provides attitude measurement accuracies of ±500 μrad, 3σ, in pitch and yaw, and ±1500 μrad 3σ, 3σ, in roll. Because the image processing is hosted on the spacecraft's computer, the unit is extremely lightweight (<1.2 kg), and uses a small amount of power (<7.0 W with 1 Hz updates). The Star Tracker Camera incorporates a compact, 3 element, wide field-of-view (FOV) lens based upon the lens developed for the Clementine spacecraft. For the camera's 25 degree circular FOV, a star catalog with 933 stars provides full sky coverage. The Stellar Compass™ software uses pattern matching techniques to provide a quaternion output. In acquisition mode, \"candidate\" stars are compared with the entire star catalog to achieve a \"lost-in-space\" capability. Once an initial attitude measurement is obtained, the software can be operated in the more computationally efficient track mode, where only small windows of the image are utilized to track the stars. In this paper, we present some of the key design features of the Star Tracker Camera, and describe how the design has been advanced over the Clementine design. We then provide an overview of the Stellar Compass™ software design and operation, and discuss the selection of the embedded star catalog for these missions. Finally, we present some test data for the engineering development unit (EDU).","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002959","afid":"60002959","affilname":"Lockheed Martin Corporation","affiliation-city":"Bethesda","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100323456","afid":"100323456","affilname":"Intelligent Decisions, Incorporated","affiliation-city":"Los Altos","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006777344","authid":"7006777344","authname":"Chapel J.","surname":"Chapel","given-name":"Jim D.","initials":"J.D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002959"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602725207","authid":"6602725207","authname":"Kiessig R.","surname":"Kiessig","given-name":"Richard","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"100323456"}]}],"source-id":"12376","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84947873306"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84947873306?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84947873306&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84947873306&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84947873306","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84947873306","eid":"2-s2.0-84947873306","dc:title":"Hypervolume visualization: A challenge in simplicity","dc:creator":"Bajaj C.L.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE Symposium on Volume Visualization, VVS 1998","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"1581131054"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781581131055"}],"prism:pageRange":"95-102","prism:coverDate":"1998-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 1998","prism:doi":"10.1145/288126.288173","dc:description":"Hyper-volume visualization is designed to provide simple and fully explanatory images that give comprehensive insights into the global structure of scalar fields of any dimension. The basic idea is to have a dimension independent viewing system that scales nicely with the geometric dimension of the dataset and that can be combined with classical approaches like isocontouring and animation of slices of rD data. We completely abandon (for core simplicity) rendering techniques, such as hidden surface removal or lighting or ra-diosity, that enhance three dimensional realism and concentrate on the real-time display of images that highlight structural (topological) features of the nD dataset (holes, tunnels, cavities, depressions, extrema, etc). Hyper-volume visualization on the one hand is a generalization of direct parallel projection methods in volume rendering. To achieve efficiency (and real-time performance on a graphics workstation) we combine the advantages of (i) a hierarchical representations of the hyper-volume data for multiresolution display and (if) generalized object space splatting combined with texture-mapped graphics hardware acceleration. The development of a system that implements display techniques for multidimensional datasets requires careful design of both algorithms and user interfaces that scale linearly with the dimension n of the input geometric space. This is a major challenge since straightforward generalizations of standard techniques that are suitable for display of 3D data yield exceedingly intricate interfaces. For example, a view manipulation graphical user interface is usually based on a rotation of the object about Cartesian rotation axes, withpos-sibly unit quaternions internal representations for the rotation group. Unfortunately the number of independent rotation axes grows qjiadratically with dimension(three in 3D to six in 4D to ten in 5D to fifteen in 6D space). Going back to the basics of parallel projections, we develop an alternative scheme that is very simple to implement and immediately gives a view manipulation graphical user interface that scales linearly with the dimension. One can still utilize matrix or quaternion or higher dimensional rotational group representations, internally for calculations. The main results of our paper are thus both a multi-resolution direct rendering algorithm and scalable graphical user interface that provides insignirmi global views of scalar fields in any dimension, while maintaining the fundamental characteristics of ease of use, and quick exploratory user interaction.","citedby-count":"35","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028629","afid":"60028629","affilname":"College of Science","affiliation-city":"West Lafayette","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026175","afid":"60026175","affilname":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","affiliation-city":"Livermore","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013372","afid":"60013372","affilname":"The University of Texas at Austin","affiliation-city":"Austin","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004410340","authid":"7004410340","authname":"Bajaj C.L.","surname":"Bajaj","given-name":"C.

The isomorphic image p = ϕ(A) in C (Q), where the quadratic form Q has a suitable signature (p, q), is exponentiated modulo a minimal polynomial of p using Clifford exponential.

In this paper we consider the case where M is a Fano manifold; this implies that L is ample. If g is a simple Lie algebra, the unique closed orbit in P(g) (for the adjoint action) is a Fano contact manifold; it is conjectured that every Fano contact manifold is obtained in this way. A positive answer would imply an analogous result for compact quaternion-Kahler manifolds with positive scalar curvature, a longstanding question in Riemannian geometry. In this paper we solve the conjecture under the additional assumptions that the group of contact automorphisms of M is reductive, and that the image of the rational map M -→ P(H0(M, L)*) associated to L has maximum dimension. The proof relies on the properties of the nilpotent orbits in a semi-simple Lie algebra, in particular on the work of R. Brylinski and B. Kostant.","citedby-count":"37","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000179","afid":"60000179","affilname":"École Normale Supérieure","affiliation-city":"Paris","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603623999","authid":"6603623999","authname":"Beauville A.","surname":"Beauville","given-name":"Arnaud","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000179"}]}],"authkeywords":"Contact moment map | Contact structure | Fano manifolds | Nilpotent orbits | Quaternion-Kähler manifolds","source-id":"25787","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0032219223"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0032219223?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0032219223&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0032219223&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0021892898000252"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0032219223","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0032219223","eid":"2-s2.0-0032219223","dc:title":"Integration of the equations of a rotational motion of a rigid body in quaternion algebra.

A homomorphism H → SO(3) is used such that the unit sphere S3 ⊂ H, invariant under the system, is transformed into the rotation group SO(3). The homomorphic image of the system is identical with the dynamics of rotational motion of a rigid body. The equations of motion are completely integrated in the Euler case. To this end Weierstrass' elliptic functions are used. The following goals are achieved within the framework of the method: (a) when representing the algorithms for modelling the dynamics it suffices to use only one chart from the atlas of the phase space manifold, (b) the point in the configuration space of the actual motion lies on the unit sphere, which ensures the best accuracy in numerical procedures, and (c) in the majority of applications the right-hand sides of the equations of perturbed motion depend polynomially on the phase variables, which simplifies the use of computer algebra in analytic theories. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Earlier models of the oculomotor plant assumed that the muscle axes remained fixed relative to the head as the eye rotated into secondary and tertiary eye positions. Under this assumption, the vector integrator model generates torsional transients as the eye moves from secondary to tertiary positions of fixation. The torsional transient represents an eye movement response to a spatial mismatch between the torque axes that remain fixed in the head and the displacement plane that changes by half the angle of the change in eye orientation. When muscle axis shifts were incorporated into the model, the torque axes were closer to the displacement plane at each eye orientation throughout the trajectory, and torsional transients were reduced dramatically. Their size and dynamics were close to reported data. It was also shown that when the muscle torque axes were rotated by 50% of the eye rotation, there was no torsional transient and Listing's law was perfectly obeyed. When muscle torque axes rotated >50%, torsional transients reversed direction compared with what occurred for muscle axis shifts of <50%. The model indicates that Listing's law is implemented by the oculomotor plant subject to a two-dimensional command signal that is confined to the pitchyaw plane, having zero torsion. Saccades that bring the eye to orientations outside Listing's plane could easily be corrected by a roll pulse that resets the roll state of the velocity-position integrator to zero. This would be a simple implementation of the corrective controller suggested by Van Opstal and colleagues. The model further indicates that muscle axis shifts together with the torque orientation relationship for tissue surrounding the eye and Newton's laws of motion form a sufficient plant model to explain saccadic trajectories and periods of fixation when driven by a vector command confined to the pitch-yaw plane. This implies that the velocity-position integrator is probably realized as a subtractive feedback vector integrator and not as a quaternion-based integrator that implements kinematic transformations to orient the eye.","citedby-count":"166","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007033","afid":"60007033","affilname":"City University of New York","affiliation-city":"New York","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"pubmed-id":"9582236","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005885674","authid":"7005885674","authname":"Raphan T.","surname":"Raphan","given-name":"Theodore","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007033"}]}],"source-id":"23475","fund-acr":"NEI","fund-no":"R01EY004148","fund-sponsor":"National Eye Institute","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0031643052"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0031643052?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0031643052&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0031643052&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0031643052","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0031643052","eid":"2-s2.0-0031643052","dc:title":"Computationally efficient implementation of hypercomplex digital filters","dc:creator":"Toyoshima H.","prism:publicationName":"ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - Proceedings","prism:issn":"15206149","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"0780344286"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780780344280"}],"prism:volume":"3","prism:pageRange":"1761-1764","prism:coverDate":"1998-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1998","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1998.681800","dc:description":"Hypercomplex digital filters have an attractive advantage of order reduction; however, they also have a drawback that multiplication requires a large amount of computation.

Included in the algorithm are three multi-state Extended Kalman Filters (EKFs) which correct the payload LOS attitude error as well as on-gimbal gyro bias error using celestial observations. For the GEO mission, the celestial observations are obtained using two spacecraft visible star trackers. However, for the HEO mission, the celestial observations are obtained by viewing the in-band IR stars from the payload sensor itself. The derivations of the EKFs using a quaternion formulation are given in the paper for both missions. Time domain simulations are presented to show the predicted filter performance, which is a function of star density/availability, star catalog error, star centroiding accuracy, gimbal angle readout errors, and gyro noises. Preliminary analysis indicate that the allocated Payload LOS attitude determination performance requirement can be met with the proposed attitude determination hardware and algorithms.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005304","afid":"60005304","affilname":"Raytheon","affiliation-city":"Waltham","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/10639606000","authid":"10639606000","authname":"Wu A.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Andy","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005304"}]}],"source-id":"78749","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0031624084"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0031624084?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0031624084&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0031624084&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0031624084","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0031624084","eid":"2-s2.0-0031624084","dc:title":"Suppression of the sensory conflict status using biofeedback information channel","dc:creator":"Goussev V.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the International Conference on Biomedical Engineering Days","prism:pageRange":"29-32","prism:coverDate":"1998-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1998","dc:description":"Proposed is the biofeedback technique to diminish or eliminate the sensory conflict status using the galvanic stimulation of the vestibular pathway.
