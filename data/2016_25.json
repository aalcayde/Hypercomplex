Method: Several tremor modeling algorithms, such as the weighted Fourier linear combiner (wFLC), have proved effective. They, however, treat the three-dimensional (3-D) tremor signal as three independent 1-D signals in the x-, y-, and z-axes. In addition, the force f by which a surgeon holds the instrument has never been taken into account in modeling. Hence, conventional algorithms are inherently blind to any potential multidimensional couplings. Results: We first show that there exists statistically significant subject- and task-dependent coherence between data in the x-, y-, z -, and f-axes. We hypothesize that a filter that models the tremor in 4-D (x , y, z, and f ) yields a more accurate model of tremor. We, therefore, developed a quaternion version of the wFLC algorithm and termed it QwFLC. We tested the proposed QwFLC algorithm with real physiological tremor data that were recorded from five novice subjects and four experienced microsurgeons. Although compared to wFLC, QwFLC requires six times larger computational resources, we showed that QwFLC can improve the modeling by up to 67% and that the improvement is proportional to the total coherence between the tremor in xyz and the force signal. Conclusion: By taking into account interactions of the 3-D tremor and the force data, the tremor modeling performance enhances significantly.","citedby-count":"28","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026712","afid":"60026712","affilname":"University of Newcastle upon Tyne, Faculty of Medical Sciences","affiliation-city":"Newcastle","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012704","afid":"60012704","affilname":"Kyungpook National University","affiliation-city":"Daegu","affiliation-country":"South Korea"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006222","afid":"60006222","affilname":"Newcastle University","affiliation-city":"Newcastle","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005510","afid":"60005510","affilname":"Nanyang Technological University","affiliation-city":"Singapore City","affiliation-country":"Singapore"}],"pubmed-id":"26890529","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56808983400","authid":"56808983400","authname":"Adhikari K.","surname":"Adhikari","given-name":"Kabita","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006222"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54947284700","authid":"54947284700","authname":"Tatinati S.","surname":"Tatinati","given-name":"Sivanagaraja","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012704"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16240990400","authid":"16240990400","authname":"Ang W.T.","surname":"Ang","given-name":"Wei Tech","initials":"W.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005510"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8703318200","authid":"8703318200","authname":"Veluvolu K.C.","surname":"Veluvolu","given-name":"Kalyana C.","initials":"K.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012704"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23390436100","authid":"23390436100","authname":"Nazarpour K.","surname":"Nazarpour","given-name":"Kianoush","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006222"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026712"}]}],"authkeywords":"Physiological tremor | quaternion algebra | weighted Fourier linear combiner","article-number":"7407359","source-id":"16318","fund-acr":"EPSRC","fund-no":"EP/M025594/1","fund-sponsor":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84990931504"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84990931504?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84990931504&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84990931504&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0950705116302337"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84990931504","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84990931504","eid":"2-s2.0-84990931504","dc:title":"Adaptive affinity propagation method based on improved cuckoo search","dc:creator":"Jia B.","prism:publicationName":"Knowledge-Based Systems","prism:issn":"09507051","prism:volume":"111","prism:pageRange":"27-35","prism:coverDate":"2016-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 November 2016","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.knosys.2016.07.039","pii":"S0950705116302337","dc:description":"Affinity propagation (AP) is an efficient clustering technique to deal with datasets of many instances; however, it has oscillations and its preference value needs to be preset.

The proposed solution is a quaternion switching vector filter in which the impulse detection consists of two stages. First, by using quaternion representation, an effective color distance measure method is developed. Then, based on the new color distance measure, the proposed filter utilizes the directional samples along four directions to classify image pixels into possible noisy and noise-free ones. For possible noisy pixels, the concept of peer group is modified and extended to the directional samples to further detect whether they are corrupted by impulse noise or not. Finally, a weighted vector median filter is performed only on the pixels that are identified as noisy by the second stage. The experimental comparisons exhibit the validity of the proposed solution by showing significant performance improvements over other well-known color image filtering methods.","citedby-count":"31","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025761","afid":"60025761","affilname":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15922652500","authid":"15922652500","authname":"Jin L.","surname":"Jin","given-name":"Lianghai","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57213268188","authid":"57213268188","authname":"Zhu Z.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Zhiliang","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55706250100","authid":"55706250100","authname":"Xu X.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Xiangyang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189218464","authid":"57189218464","authname":"Li X.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Xiang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image | Impulse noise | Quaternion | Vector filter","source-id":"25548","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61370179","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963976003"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963976003?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84963976003&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84963976003&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1077314216300297"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963976003","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84963976003","eid":"2-s2.0-84963976003","dc:title":"R3DG features: Relative 3D geometry-based skeletal representations for human action recognition","dc:creator":"Vemulapalli R.","prism:publicationName":"Computer Vision and Image Understanding","prism:issn":"10773142","prism:eIssn":"1090235X","prism:volume":"152","prism:pageRange":"155-166","prism:coverDate":"2016-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 November 2016","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.cviu.2016.04.005","pii":"S1077314216300297","dc:description":"Recently introduced cost-effective depth sensors coupled with real-time skeleton extraction algorithms have generated a renewed interest in skeleton-based human action recognition. Most of the existing skeleton-based approaches use either the joint locations or the joint angles to represent the human skeleton. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a new family of skeletal representations for human action recognition, which we refer to as R3DG features. The proposed representations explicitly model the 3D geometric relationships between various body parts using rigid body transformations, i.e., rotations and translations in 3D space. Using the proposed skeletal representations, human actions are modeled as curves in R3DG feature spaces. Finally, we perform action recognition by classifying these curves using a combination of dynamic time warping, Fourier temporal pyramid representation and support vector machines. Experimental results on five benchmark action datasets show that the proposed representations perform better than many existing skeletal representations. The proposed approach also outperforms various state-of-the-art skeleton-based human action recognition approaches.","citedby-count":"37","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020304","afid":"60020304","affilname":"University of Maryland, College Park","affiliation-city":"College Park","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007087","afid":"60007087","affilname":"Universidad TÃ©cnica Federico Santa MarÃ­a","affiliation-city":"ValparaÃ­so","affiliation-country":"Chile"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35766933000","authid":"35766933000","orcid":"0000-0003-0425-7797","authname":"Vemulapalli R.","surname":"Vemulapalli","given-name":"Raviteja","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020304"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15050174300","authid":"15050174300","orcid":"0000-0002-8328-8163","authname":"Arrate F.","surname":"Arrate","given-name":"Felipe","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007087"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203078416","authid":"57203078416","authname":"Chellappa R.","surname":"Chellappa","given-name":"Rama","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020304"}]}],"authkeywords":"Action recognition | Dual quaternions | Lie groups | Quaternions | Skeletal representations | Special Euclidean group | Special orthogonal group","source-id":"24161","fund-acr":"MURI","fund-no":"1141221258513","fund-sponsor":"Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85007242820"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85007242820?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85007242820&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85007242820&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85007242820","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85007242820","eid":"2-s2.0-85007242820","dc:title":"Multi-valued autoencoders for multi-valued neural networks","dc:creator":"Hata R.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781509006199"}],"prism:volume":"2016-October","prism:pageRange":"4412-4417","prism:coverDate":"2016-10-31","prism:coverDisplayDate":"31 October 2016","prism:doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727776","dc:description":"In order to reduce data dimensions, autoencoders with neural networks have been proposed by Hinton et al. Autoencoders are composed of input, one hidden, and output layers, which tune weights and biases by a back propagation to minimize an error between inputs and outputs. The learned weights have input features, and can be applied to pretrainings of deep neural networks. However, these autoencoders have been developed for real-valued neural networks. In this study, we propose complex and quaternion autoencoders for complex and quaternion neural networks, respectively. In the complex-valued autoencoder, inputs, weights, biases and outputs of the real-valued autoencoder are extended to complex numbers. In the quaternion autoencoder, these parameters are extended to quaternion numbers. We show the learning abilities of the proposed methods using handwritten digit images.

Although this problem is tough to solve, these systems continue to be of interest because their hydraulic manipulators have a high power-to-weight ratio, which can be used for a variety of tasks. In order to enable a hydraulic manipulator to perform these tasks, the position and orientation of its end-effector must be controlled. We have designed Virtual Spring-Damper (VSD) hypothesis based quaternion controller to control the orientation of a hydraulic manipulator end-effector. VSD hypothesis is a relatively simple calculation method that uses virtual force and joint damping to move the end-position of a robot arm to the desired position (control point). We extended VSD hypothesis for orientation control and connected 2 additional VSD models to the wrist and thumb in order to control the orientation of an end-effector with 3 degrees of freedom (DoF). We have proposed a quaternion controller to determine control points used as input for each VSD model. We have also designed VSD controller to calculate the control input of joints; this input is used for the movement to each control point. In order to verify the performance of the proposed control method, we present the results of experiments performed on a hydraulic manipulator with 7 DoF.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104012","afid":"60104012","affilname":"University of Science and Technology (UST)","affiliation-city":"Daejeon","affiliation-country":"South Korea"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60080940","afid":"60080940","affilname":"Korea Institute of Industrial Technology","affiliation-city":"Cheonan","affiliation-country":"South Korea"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56022862500","authid":"56022862500","authname":"Kim J.T.","surname":"Kim","given-name":"Jin Tak","initials":"J.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60080940"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55325850900","authid":"55325850900","authname":"Cho J.","surname":"Cho","given-name":"Jungsan","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60080940"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56022915200","authid":"56022915200","authname":"Park B.","surname":"Park","given-name":"Byungyun","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60080940"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56581564700","authid":"56581564700","authname":"Chon S.U.","surname":"Chon","given-name":"Sang Uk","initials":"S.U.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104012"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56580966800","authid":"56580966800","authname":"Seo J.","surname":"Seo","given-name":"Jaehong","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104012"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57362133300","authid":"57362133300","authname":"Kim J.","surname":"Kim","given-name":"Jungyeong","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104012"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55324751500","authid":"55324751500","authname":"Park S.","surname":"Park","given-name":"Sangdeok","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60080940"}]}],"authkeywords":"Hydraulic manipulator | Manipulation | Quaternion controller","article-number":"7625769","source-id":"21100787765","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85019090363"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85019090363?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85019090363&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85019090363&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85019090363","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85019090363","eid":"2-s2.0-85019090363","dc:title":"A hologram algorithm based on DWT-QDFT for hardcopy color image","dc:creator":"Xie Y.","prism:publicationName":"Guangdianzi Jiguang/Journal of Optoelectronics Laser","prism:issn":"10050086","prism:volume":"27","prism:issueIdentifier":"10","prism:pageRange":"1086-1093","prism:coverDate":"2016-10-15","prism:coverDisplayDate":"15 October 2016","prism:doi":"10.16136/j.joel.2016.10.0806","dc:description":"In order to improve the robustness of the holographic watermarking algorithm in discrete wavelet domain, we propose a robust hologram watermarking scheme based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and quaternion discrete Fourier transform (QDFT), which can be used in hardcopy color image.

Conventional methods process color images by converting them into gray scale, which is definitely not effective in representing and which may lose some significant color information. Recently, a novel method of the Color Angular Radial Transform (CART) is presented. This transform combines the information by considering the shape information inherent in the color. However, ART is adapted on the MPEG-7 standard is only limited to binary images and gray-scale images has many properties: invariant to rotation, Translation and scaling, ability to describe complex objects, so it cannot handle color images directly. To solve this problem we proposed in this article to generalize ART from complex domain to hypercomplex domain using quaternion algebras to achieve the Quaternion Angular Radial Transform (QART) to describe finally two dimensional color images and to insure these properties robustness to all possible rotations and translation and scaling. The performance of QART is then evaluated with large database of color image as an example. We first provide a general formula of ART from which we derive a set of quaternion-valued QART properties transformations by eliminating the influence of transformation parameters. The experimental results show that the QART performs better than the commonly used Quaternion form Zernike Moment (QZM) in terms of image representation capability and numerical stability.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028635","afid":"60028635","affilname":"UniversitÃ© Chouaib Doukkali","affiliation-city":"El Jadida","affiliation-country":"Morocco"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011648","afid":"60011648","affilname":"FacultÃ© des Sciences d'El Jadida","affiliation-city":"El Jadida","affiliation-country":"Morocco"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56705457800","authid":"56705457800","authname":"Khatabi A.","surname":"Khatabi","given-name":"A.","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011648"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54960878500","authid":"54960878500","authname":"Tmiri A.","surname":"Tmiri","given-name":"A.","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011648"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6507133480","authid":"6507133480","authname":"Serhir A.","surname":"Serhir","given-name":"A.","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028635"}]}],"authkeywords":"ART descriptor | color image | quaternion | quaternion angular radial transform recognition","source-id":"4700152485","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988714345"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988714345?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84988714345&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84988714345&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988714345","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84988714345","eid":"2-s2.0-84988714345","dc:title":"Analysis of seismic waves crossing the Santa Clara Valley using the three-component MUSIQUE array algorithm","dc:creator":"Hobiger M.","prism:publicationName":"Geophysical Journal International","prism:issn":"0956540X","prism:eIssn":"1365246X","prism:volume":"207","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"439-456","prism:coverDate":"2016-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2016","prism:doi":"10.1093/gji/ggw289","dc:description":"We introduce the MUSIQUE algorithm and apply it to seismic wavefield recordings in California. The algorithm is designed to analyse seismic signals recorded by arrays of three-component seismic sensors. It is based on the MUSIC and the quaternion-MUSIC algorithms. In a first step, the MUSIC algorithm is applied in order to estimate the backazimuth and velocity of incident seismic waves and to discriminate between Love and possible Rayleigh waves. In a second step, the polarization parameters of possible Rayleigh waves are analysed using quaternion-MUSIC, distinguishing retrograde and prograde Rayleigh waves and determining their ellipticity. In this study, we apply the MUSIQUE algorithm to seismic wavefield recordings of the San Jose Dense Seismic Array. This array has been installed in 1999 in the Evergreen Basin, a sedimentary basin in the Eastern Santa Clara Valley. The analysis includes 22 regional earthquakes with epicentres between 40 and 600 km distant from the array and covering different backazimuths with respect to the array. The azimuthal distribution and the energy partition of the different surface wave types are analysed. Love waves dominate the wavefield for the vast majority of the events. For close events in the north, the wavefield is dominated by the first harmonic mode of Love waves, for farther events, the fundamental mode dominates. The energy distribution is different for earthquakes occurring northwest and southeast of the array. In both cases, the waves crossing the array are mostly arriving from the respective hemicycle. However, scattered Love waves arriving from the south can be seen for all earthquakes. Combining the information of all events, it is possible to retrieve the Love wave dispersion curves of the fundamental and the first harmonic mode. The particle motion of the fundamental mode of Rayleigh waves is retrograde and for the first harmonic mode, it is prograde. For both modes, we can also retrieve dispersion and ellipticity curves.Wave motion simulations for two earthquakes are in good agreement with the real data results and confirm the identification of the wave scattering formations to the south of the array, which generate the scattered Love waves visible for all earthquakes.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60109424","afid":"60109424","affilname":"Institut des Sciences de la Terre (ISTerre)","affiliation-city":"Grenoble","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025858","afid":"60025858","affilname":"ETH ZÃ¼rich","affiliation-city":"Zurich ZH,","affiliation-country":"Switzerland"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008134","afid":"60008134","affilname":"CNRS Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique","affiliation-city":"Paris","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35072763200","authid":"35072763200","authname":"Hobiger M.","surname":"Hobiger","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025858"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60109424"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7801359333","authid":"7801359333","authname":"Cornou C.","surname":"Cornou","given-name":"CÃ©cile","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60109424"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004123744","authid":"7004123744","authname":"Bard P.Y.","surname":"Bard","given-name":"Pierre Yves","initials":"P.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60109424"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6507015909","authid":"6507015909","authname":"Bihan N.L.","surname":"Bihan","given-name":"Nicolas Le","initials":"N.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008134"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35758631100","authid":"35758631100","authname":"Imperatori W.","surname":"Imperatori","given-name":"Walter","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025858"}]}],"authkeywords":"Earthquake ground motions | Site effects | Surface waves and free oscillations | Wave scattering and diffraction","article-number":"ggw289","source-id":"27947","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84987984368"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84987984368?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84987984368&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84987984368&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84987984368","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84987984368","eid":"2-s2.0-84987984368","dc:title":"Stereo Visual-Inertial Odometry with Multiple Kalman Filters Ensemble","dc:creator":"Liu Y.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","prism:issn":"02780046","prism:volume":"63","prism:issueIdentifier":"10","prism:pageRange":"6205-6216","prism:coverDate":"2016-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"October 2016","prism:doi":"10.1109/TIE.2016.2573765","dc:description":"In this paper, we present a stereo visual-inertial odometry algorithm assembled with three separated Kalman filters, i.e., attitude filter, orientation filter, and position filter.

Then the quaternion moments are applied to extract the invariant features, which are crucial to generate the master share. Together with the scrambled watermark, they are used for constructing the ownership share based on visual cryptography.

Its main mission consisted in the in-orbit release of a number of on-board carried Cubesats and in the transmission to the UniSat-6 ground station of telemetry data and images from an on-board mounted camera. The spacecraft is equipped with a passive magnetic attitude control system. Gyros and magnetometers provide the information about the attitude of the spacecraft. The importance of reconstructing the attitude motion of UniSat-6 lies in the dual possibility, for future missions, of:controlling the direction of ejection of the on-board carried satelliteshaving an accurate pointing for remote sensing operation.The reconstruction of the attitude motion of UniSat-6 is based on the data of the on-board Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) gyros and magnetometers, downloaded at the passages over the ground station in Roma, Italy. At ground, these data have been processed with the UnScented QUaternion Estimator (USQUE) algorithm. This estimator is an adaptation of the Unscented Filter to the problem of spacecraft attitude estimation. The USQUE is based on a dual attitude representation, which involves both quaternions and Generalized Rodrigues Parameters. In this work, the propagation phase of the algorithm contains only a kinematic model of the motion of the spacecraft. This paper presents the results of the reconstruction of the UniSat-6 attitude using on-board measurements. The results show that the spacecraft effectively stabilized its attitude motion thanks to the on-board magnetic devices.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60113495","afid":"60113495","affilname":"GAUSS Srl","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024989","afid":"60024989","affilname":"Universidade de BrasÃ­lia","affiliation-city":"Brasilia","affiliation-country":"Brazil"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/41261064400","authid":"41261064400","authname":"Battistini S.","surname":"Battistini","given-name":"Simone","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024989"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25627559800","authid":"25627559800","authname":"Cappelletti C.","surname":"Cappelletti","given-name":"Chantal","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024989"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34769603100","authid":"34769603100","authname":"Graziani F.","surname":"Graziani","given-name":"Filippo","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60113495"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude estimation | Unscented Quaternion Estimator","source-id":"12372","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84946865886"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84946865886?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84946865886&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84946865886&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84946865886","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84946865886","eid":"2-s2.0-84946865886","dc:title":"Complete hyperbolic lattices derived from tessellations of type {4g, 4g}","dc:creator":"Queiroz C.Q.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Algebra and its Applications","prism:issn":"02194988","prism:volume":"15","prism:issueIdentifier":"8","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2016-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2016","prism:doi":"10.1142/S0219498816501577","dc:description":"Regular tessellations of the hyperbolic plane play an important role in the design of signal constellations for digital communication systems.

Until now, the design of neural networks has been inspired by the biological models of neural networks but mostly using vector calculus and linear algebra. However, these designs have never shown the role of geometric computing. The question is how biological neural networks handle complex geometric representations involving Lie group operations like rotations. Even though the actual artificial neural networks are biologically inspired, they are just models which cannot reproduce a plausible biological process. Until now researchers have not shown how, using these models, one can incorporate them into the processing of geometric computing. Here, for the first time in the artificial neural networks domain, we address this issue by designing a kind of geometric RBF using the geometric algebra framework. As a result, using our artificial networks, we show how geometric computing can be carried out by the artificial neural networks. Such geometric neural networks have a great potential in robot vision. This is the most important aspect of this contribution to propose artificial geometric neural networks for challenging tasks in perception and action. In our experimental analysis, we show the applicability of our geometric designs, and present interesting experiments using 2-D data of real images and 3-D screw axis data. In general, our models should be used to process different types of inputs, such as visual cues, touch (texture, elasticity, temperature), taste, and sound. One important task of a perception-action system is to fuse a variety of cues coming from the environment and relate them via a sensor-motor manifold with motor modules to carry out diverse reasoned actions.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017323","afid":"60017323","affilname":"Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto PolitÃ©cnico Nacional","affiliation-city":"Mexico","affiliation-country":"Mexico"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55995861000","authid":"55995861000","authname":"Bayro-Corrochano E.","surname":"Bayro-Corrochano","given-name":"Eduardo","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017323"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36622385900","authid":"36622385900","authname":"Vazquez-Santacruz E.","surname":"Vazquez-Santacruz","given-name":"Eduardo","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017323"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36667039500","authid":"36667039500","authname":"Moya-Sanchez E.","surname":"Moya-Sanchez","given-name":"Eduardo","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017323"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55338115000","authid":"55338115000","authname":"Castillo-Munis E.","surname":"Castillo-Munis","given-name":"Efrain","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017323"}]}],"authkeywords":"Biologically inspired networks | Clifford algebra | conformal geometric algebra | geometric neural networks | image processing | quaternion filtering","article-number":"7230270","source-id":"21100235616","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84980368225"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84980368225?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84980368225&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84980368225&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84980368225","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84980368225","eid":"2-s2.0-84980368225","dc:title":"Constructing prolate spheroidal quaternion wave functions on the sphere","dc:creator":"Morais J.","prism:publicationName":"Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences","prism:issn":"01704214","prism:eIssn":"10991476","prism:volume":"39","prism:issueIdentifier":"14","prism:pageRange":"3961-3978","prism:coverDate":"2016-09-30","prism:coverDisplayDate":"30 September 2016","prism:doi":"10.1002/mma.3838","dc:description":"Over the last years, considerable attention has been paid to the role of the prolate spheroidal wave functions (PSWFs) introduced in the early sixties by D. Slepian and H.O. Pollak to many practical signal and image processing problems. The PSWFs and their applications to wave phenomena modeling, fluid dynamics, and filter design played a key role in this development. In this paper, we introduce the prolate spheroidal quaternion wave functions (PSQWFs), which refine and extend the PSWFs. The PSQWFs are ideally suited to study certain questions regarding the relationship between quaternionic functions and their Fourier transforms. We show that the PSQWFs are orthogonal and complete over two different intervals: the space of square integrable functions over a finite interval and the three-dimensional PaleyâWiener space of bandlimited functions. No other system of classical generalized orthogonal functions is known to possess this unique property. We illustrate how to apply the PSQWFs for the quaternionic Fourier transform to analyze Slepian's energy concentration problem. We address all of the aforementioned and explore some basic facts of the arising quaternionic function theory. We conclude the paper by computing the PSQWFs restricted in frequency to the unit sphere. The representation of these functions in terms of generalized spherical harmonics is explicitly given, from which several fundamental properties can be derived. As an application, we provide the reader with plot simulations that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

To solve this problem, an algorithm based on contour curve is proposed for fracture surfaces matching. Firstly, the algorithm combines region growing algorithm and boundary tracking algorithm for surface segmentation and contour extraction simultaneously. Next, the contour matching includes rough matching based on the corner point distance matrix, which can eliminate most of the dissimilar contour pairs, and fine matching based on Hausdorff distance according to the curvatures and torsions of all contour curve vertices. Finally, the quaternion method is used to calculate rigid transformation based on contour pairs. The optimal matching is the fragment pairs which satisfy the cross-boundary continuity detection and have minimum errors. We use a variety of rough and smooth fracture surfaces of different materials to test the algorithm. Experimental results show that the algorithm can achieve better matching of fracture surfaces with rare or abundant features.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028891","afid":"60028891","affilname":"Chang'an University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023237","afid":"60023237","affilname":"Beijing Normal University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001298","afid":"60001298","affilname":"Northwest University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55515128300","authid":"55515128300","authname":"Li Q.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Qunhui","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028891"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191198333","authid":"57191198333","authname":"Zhang J.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Junzu","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028891"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006815450","authid":"7006815450","authname":"Geng G.","surname":"Geng","given-name":"Guohua","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001298"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9332570500","authid":"9332570500","authname":"Zhou M.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Mingquan","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023237"}]}],"authkeywords":"Contour curve matching | Cross-boundary continuity detection | Fracture surfaces matching | Fracture surfaces segmentation","source-id":"26196","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992303269"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992303269?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84992303269&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84992303269&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S092523121630114X"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992303269","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84992303269","eid":"2-s2.0-84992303269","dc:title":"Quaternion discrete cosine transformation signature analysis in crowd scenes for abnormal event detection","dc:creator":"Guo H.","prism:publicationName":"Neurocomputing","prism:issn":"09252312","prism:eIssn":"18728286","prism:volume":"204","prism:pageRange":"106-115","prism:coverDate":"2016-09-05","prism:coverDisplayDate":"5 September 2016","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.neucom.2015.07.153","pii":"S092523121630114X","dc:description":"In this paper, an abnormal event detection approach inspired by the saliency attention mechanism of human visual system is presented. Conventionally, statistics-based methods suffer from visual scale, complexity of normal events and insufficiency of training data, for the reason that a normal behavior model established from normal video data is used to detect unusual behaviors with an assumption that anomalies are events with rare appearance. Instead, we make the assumption that anomalies are events that attract human attention. Temporal and spatial anomaly saliency are considered consistently by representing the pixel value in each frame as a quaternion, with weighted components that composed of intensity, contour, motion-speed and motion-direction feature. For each quaternion frame, Quaternion Discrete Cosine Transformation (QDCT) and signature operation are applied. The spatio-temporal anomaly saliency map is developed by inverse QDCT and Gaussian smoothing. By multi-scale analyzing, abnormal events appear at those areas with high saliency score. Experiments on typical datasets show that our method can achieve high accuracy results.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60102083","afid":"60102083","affilname":"Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology","affiliation-city":"Shenzhen","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026282","afid":"60026282","affilname":"Zhejiang University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Hangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002798","afid":"60002798","affilname":"Chinese University of Hong Kong","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56118879800","authid":"56118879800","authname":"Guo H.","surname":"Guo","given-name":"Huiwen","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102083"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7407065301","authid":"7407065301","authname":"Wu X.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Xinyu","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102083"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002798"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55960159100","authid":"55960159100","authname":"Cai S.","surname":"Cai","given-name":"Shibo","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026282"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55556478600","authid":"55556478600","authname":"Li N.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Nannan","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102083"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14057685600","authid":"14057685600","authname":"Cheng J.","surname":"Cheng","given-name":"Jun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102083"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/46461232000","authid":"46461232000","authname":"Chen Y.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Yen Lun","initials":"Y.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102083"}]}],"authkeywords":"Multi-scale analysis | Quaternion discrete cosine transformation | Spectral analysis | Video anomaly detection","source-id":"24807","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"201001D0104648280","fund-sponsor":"Guangdong Province Introduction of Innovative R&amp;D Team","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992091185"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992091185?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84992091185&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84992091185&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992091185","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84992091185","eid":"2-s2.0-84992091185","dc:title":"Adaptation of spherical harmonic transform for color shape reconstruction and retrieval using quaternion algebra","dc:creator":"Dad N.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Electronic Imaging","prism:issn":"10179909","prism:eIssn":"1560229X","prism:volume":"25","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2016-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 September 2016","prism:doi":"10.1117/1.JEI.25.5.053026","dc:description":"A set of invariant quaternion moments based on an adaptation of the three-dimensional (3-D) spherical harmonic transform (SHT) for describing two-dimensional color shapes is proposed. The use of quaternions to deal with the color part is beneficial in the way the three color components are integrated in a single feature. An adequate mapping from the 3-D SHT to the unit disc allows a fast and accurate computation of the proposed moments. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the obtained moments in terms of color image reconstruction, robustness to geometric and photometric transformations, content-based color shape retrieval, and computation time.

Robust image hashing, also referred to as perceptual image hashing, is widely applied in multimedia authentication and forensics, image retrieval, image indexing, and digital image watermarking. In this work, a novel robust image hashing method based on quaternion Zernike moments (QZMs) is proposed. QZMs offer a sound way to jointly deal with the three channels of color images without discarding chrominance information; the generated hash is thus shorter than the hash of three channels separately processing. The proposed approach's performance was evaluated on the color images database of UCID and compared with several recent and efficient methods. These experiments show that the proposed scheme provides a short hash in length that is robust to most common image content-preserving manipulations like JPEG compression, filtering, noise, scaling, and large angle rotation operations.","citedby-count":"31","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024617","afid":"60024617","affilname":"Hunan University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Xiangtan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023932","afid":"60023932","affilname":"University of Technology Sydney","affiliation-city":"Sydney","affiliation-country":"Australia"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55446539500","authid":"55446539500","authname":"Ouyang J.","surname":"Ouyang","given-name":"Junlin","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024617"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023932"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55445953300","authid":"55445953300","authname":"Wen X.","surname":"Wen","given-name":"Xingzi","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024617"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55612676700","authid":"55612676700","authname":"Liu J.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Jianxun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024617"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16506246700","authid":"16506246700","authname":"Chen J.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Jinjun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024617"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023932"}]}],"authkeywords":"Image forensics | Multimedia authentication | Quaternion Zernike moments | Robust image hashing","article-number":"63","source-id":"4700151918","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"2015BAF32B01","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84987722680"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84987722680?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84987722680&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84987722680&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84987722680","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84987722680","eid":"2-s2.0-84987722680","dc:title":"A new proof of the generalized hamiltonianâreal calculus","dc:creator":"Xu D.","prism:publicationName":"Royal Society Open Science","prism:eIssn":"20545703","prism:volume":"3","prism:issueIdentifier":"9","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2016-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"September 2016","prism:doi":"10.1098/rsos.160211","dc:description":"The recently introduced generalized HamiltonianâReal (GHR) calculus comprises, for the first time, the product and chain rules that makes it a powerful tool for quaternion-based optimization and adaptive signal processing.
