This paper studied the feasibility of a wearable inertial sensor network (WISN) and its associated shoulder ROM estimation algorithm for shoulder ROM assessment. The WISN composed of three inertial modules were placed on the trunk, upper arm, and forearm of human for assessment of shoulder ROM in real time. Each inertial module consists of an ARM-based 32-bit microcontroller, a triaxial accelerometer, a triaxial gyroscope, a triaxial magnetometer, and a controller area network (CAN) transceiver. The measured accelerations, angular velocities, and magnetic signals generated by the human shoulder movements are transmitted to a personal computer via a Bluetooth wireless transmission module. The proposed shoulder ROM estimation algorithm includes the procedures of data collection, signal preprocessing, quaternion-based orientation estimation, and shoulder joint compensation. In order to evaluate shoulder ROM accurately, accelerations, angular velocities, and magnetic signals are integrated into a quaternion-based complementary nonlinear filter for minimizing the cumulative errors caused by the drift of the inertial sensors. Experimental results demonstrate that the WISN with the designed shoulder ROM estimation algorithm, compared to an optical motion analysis system (Vicon), have the average root mean square (RMS) angle errors ranging from 2.53° to 3.56°. In addition, the intra-tester reliability for each shoulder ROM measurement is excellent. The proposed WISN is a valid and reliable tool and can be used anywhere without any external reference device for convenient evaluation of shoulder ROM.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073386","afid":"60073386","affilname":"National Cheng Kung University Hospital","affiliation-city":"Tainan","affiliation-country":"Taiwan"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014982","afid":"60014982","affilname":"National Cheng Kung University","affiliation-city":"Tainan","affiliation-country":"Taiwan"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004879","afid":"60004879","affilname":"Feng Chia University","affiliation-city":"Taichung","affiliation-country":"Taiwan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8583116000","authid":"8583116000","orcid":"0000-0002-3143-3357","authname":"Lin Y.C.","surname":"Lin","given-name":"Yu Ching","initials":"Y.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073386"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8572437600","authid":"8572437600","orcid":"0000-0003-4082-2634","authname":"Tsai Y.J.","surname":"Tsai","given-name":"Yi Ju","initials":"Y.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014982"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36729819300","authid":"36729819300","orcid":"0000-0002-5087-5046","authname":"Hsu Y.L.","surname":"Hsu","given-name":"Yu Liang","initials":"Y.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004879"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57223041562","authid":"57223041562","orcid":"0000-0002-1571-0529","authname":"Yen M.H.","surname":"Yen","given-name":"Ming Hsin","initials":"M.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014982"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7701313582","authid":"7701313582","orcid":"0000-0002-6762-9407","authname":"Wang J.S.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Jeen Shing","initials":"J.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014982"}]}],"authkeywords":"quaternion-based complementary nonlinear filter | Rehabilitation | shoulder range of motion | wearable inertial sensor network","article-number":"9405640","source-id":"15047","fund-acr":"MOST","fund-no":"MOST 102-2221-E-006-203-MY3","fund-sponsor":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85102513846"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85102513846?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85102513846&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85102513846&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85102513846","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85102513846","eid":"2-s2.0-85102513846","dc:title":"Color Image Zero-Watermarking Using Accurate Quaternion Generalized Orthogonal Fourier–Mellin Moments","dc:creator":"Wang X.y.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision","prism:issn":"09249907","prism:eIssn":"15737683","prism:volume":"63","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"708-734","prism:coverDate":"2021-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2021","prism:doi":"10.1007/s10851-020-01002-2","dc:description":"In recent years, digital image zero-watermarking algorithm has made great progress. But there are still some problems. First, most algorithms only focus on robustness and ignore discrimination. Second, most methods have good robustness against conventional signal attacks but poor robustness against geometric attacks. Thirdly, most of the existing zero-watermarking algorithms only focus on gray-scale images, and there are relatively few researches on color images. In order to cope with these issues, this paper introduces a novel color image zero-watermarking scheme using accurate quaternion generalized orthogonal Fourier–Mellin moments (AQGOFMMs). In the first stage of the proposed method, accurate computation of generalized orthogonal Fourier–Mellin moments (GOFMMs) based on the polar pixel tiling scheme. In the next stage, the high-precision GOFMMs are extended to the accurate quaternion GOFMMs (AQGOFMMs). Finally, the immutable set of features is extracted to construct a zero-watermark. It is worth mentioning that, different from the traditional way of constructing watermark with the amplitude of moments, this algorithm uses the full 4-D features of AQGOFMMs to construct watermark. The experiment proved that proposed zero-watermarking scheme gives a good balance between discriminability and robustness. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm achieves better performance than the other existing zero-watermarking.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017010","afid":"60017010","affilname":"Liaoning Normal University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972239800","authid":"34972239800","authname":"Wang X.y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiang yang","initials":"X.y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209282355","authid":"57209282355","authname":"Wang L.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Li","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222077864","authid":"57222077864","authname":"Tian J.l.","surname":"Tian","given-name":"Jia lin","initials":"J.l.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16205443400","authid":"16205443400","authname":"Niu P.p.","surname":"Niu","given-name":"Pan pan","initials":"P.p.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972350300","authid":"34972350300","authname":"Yang H.y.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Hong ying","initials":"H.y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]}],"authkeywords":"AQGOFMMs | Discriminability | Full 4-D features | Zero-watermarking","source-id":"28501","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61472171","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85102006664"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85102006664?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85102006664&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85102006664&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0031320321000789"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85102006664","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85102006664","eid":"2-s2.0-85102006664","dc:title":"Quaternionic extended local binary pattern with adaptive structural pyramid pooling for color image representation","dc:creator":"Song T.","prism:publicationName":"Pattern Recognition","prism:issn":"00313203","prism:volume":"115","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2021","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.patcog.2021.107891","pii":"S0031320321000789","dc:description":"This paper proposes a novel feature representation method for color images, namely quaternionic extended local binary pattern (QxLBP) with adaptive structural pyramid pooling (ASPP). First, we propose a QxLBP operator to encode local neighboring information and complementary modulus and phase information in the quaternion domain of color images. In QxLBP, an extended quaternionic representation (EQR) is proposed which introduces an information term into the real part of a quaternion. The resulting EQR enables us to flexibly encode discriminative features and handle multichannel image data. Second, we propose ASPP as a multiresolution pooling way to aggregate local features. Unlike the traditional spatial pyramid pooling which is sensitive to image rotation and spatial changes, ASPP is structure-oriented pooling which can adaptively aggregate the encoded features into multiresolution histogram representations. Experiments on four benchmark image datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance for color texture classification and scene categorization.","citedby-count":"13","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020620","afid":"60020620","affilname":"Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016318","afid":"60016318","affilname":"Chengdu University of Information Technology","affiliation-city":"Chengdu","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203522510","authid":"57203522510","authname":"Song T.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Tiecheng","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57200960878","authid":"57200960878","authname":"Xin L.","surname":"Xin","given-name":"Liangliang","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12753046300","authid":"12753046300","authname":"Gao C.","surname":"Gao","given-name":"Chenqiang","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8247748100","authid":"8247748100","authname":"Zhang T.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Tianqi","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57225135133","authid":"57225135133","authname":"Huang Y.","surname":"Huang","given-name":"Yao","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016318"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image | Image classification | Local binary pattern | Quaternion | Scene categorization | Spatial pooling","article-number":"107891","source-id":"24823","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61571071","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85100652784"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85100652784?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85100652784&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85100652784&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0096300321001090"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85100652784","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85100652784","eid":"2-s2.0-85100652784","dc:title":"Fractional-order quaternion exponential moments for color images","dc:creator":"Wang C.","prism:publicationName":"Applied Mathematics and Computation","prism:issn":"00963003","prism:volume":"400","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 July 2021","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.amc.2021.126061","pii":"S0096300321001090","dc:description":"Due to their strong image description ability, in recent years, quaternion exponential moments (QEMs) have attracted wide attention from relevant researchers.

Numerical analysis of the drift error for the third-order orientation algorithm is performed. The results show that the value of the accumulated drift error using the derived two-frequency models exceeds the value of the accumulated drift error in the conventional case of a regular precession.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020130","afid":"60020130","affilname":"National Technical University Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute","affiliation-city":"Kharkiv","affiliation-country":"Ukraine"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018362","afid":"60018362","affilname":"Otto-von-Guericke-Universität Magdeburg","affiliation-city":"Magdeburg","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56395380500","authid":"56395380500","authname":"Plaksiy Y.","surname":"Plaksiy","given-name":"Yuriy","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020130"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6506478274","authid":"6506478274","authname":"Breslavsky D.","surname":"Breslavsky","given-name":"Dmitriy","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020130"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221085904","authid":"57221085904","authname":"Homozkova I.","surname":"Homozkova","given-name":"Irina","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020130"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004860972","authid":"7004860972","orcid":"0000-0001-6072-0809","authname":"Naumenko K.","surname":"Naumenko","given-name":"Konstantin","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018362"}]}],"authkeywords":"Drift error | Orientation algorithm | Quaternion | Rigid body orientation | Rotation tensor | Strapdown inertial navigation system | Trajectory in configurational space","source-id":"13712","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherhybridgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Hybrid Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85109150533"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85109150533?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85109150533&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85109150533&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85109150533","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85109150533","eid":"2-s2.0-85109150533","dc:title":"Research on Improving Kinematics Equation of Traditional Orbit Parameters Based on Orbital Dynamics","dc:creator":"Gong Y.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Physics: Conference Series","prism:issn":"17426588","prism:eIssn":"17426596","prism:volume":"1952","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-06-29","prism:coverDisplayDate":"29 June 2021","prism:doi":"10.1088/1742-6596/1952/3/032006","dc:description":"Complex space missions have higher and higher requirements for orbit representation, orbit prediction and orbit control.

In order to address these problems, a novel fusion algorithm based on the quaternion multi-scale singular value decomposition (QMSVD) is proposed in this paper. First, the multi-focus color images, which represented by quaternion, to be fused is decomposed by multichannel QMSVD, and the low-frequency sub-image represented by one channel and high-frequency sub-image represented by multiple channels are obtained. Second, the activity level and matching level are exploited in the focus decision mapping of the low-frequency sub-image fusion, with the former calculated by using local window energy and the latter measured by the color difference between color pixels expressed by a quaternion. Third, the fusion results of low-frequency coefficients are incorporated into the fusion of high-frequency sub-images, and a local contrast fusion rule based on the integration of high-frequency and low-frequency regions is proposed. Finally, the fused images are reconstructed employing inverse transform of the QMSVD. Simulation results show that image fusion using this method achieves great overall visual effects, with high resolution images, rich colors, and low information loss.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020620","afid":"60020620","affilname":"Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010752","afid":"60010752","affilname":"Chongqing Normal University","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202321908","authid":"57202321908","authname":"Wan H.","surname":"Wan","given-name":"Hui","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010752"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23394027100","authid":"23394027100","authname":"Tang X.","surname":"Tang","given-name":"Xianlun","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55914596700","authid":"55914596700","authname":"Zhu Z.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Zhiqin","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201773066","authid":"57201773066","authname":"Xiao B.","surname":"Xiao","given-name":"Bin","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36067507500","authid":"36067507500","authname":"Li W.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Weisheng","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]}],"authkeywords":"image fusion | multi-focus color image | multi-scale decomposition | quaternion | singular value decomposition","article-number":"695960","source-id":"21100199837","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"KJ120611","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85112868164"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85112868164?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85112868164&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85112868164&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85112868164","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85112868164","eid":"2-s2.0-85112868164","dc:title":"Application of Decision Tree Integrated Hybrid Classifier in Feature-Fused Robot Big Data","dc:creator":"Li Z.","prism:publicationName":"ACM International Conference Proceeding Series","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781450390231"}],"prism:pageRange":"681-686","prism:coverDate":"2021-06-18","prism:coverDisplayDate":"18 June 2021","prism:doi":"10.1145/3473714.3473832","dc:description":"LightGBM is a fast distributed, high-performance gradient boosting framework based on decision tree algorithm, which can be used for sorting, classification, regression and many other machine learning tasks.

Specifically, the cover image is partitioned into non-overlapping blocks, and then QDFT is performed on each image block. Then, the three imaginary frequency components of QDFT are used to construct a third-order tensor. The third-order tensor is decomposed by Tucker decomposition and generates a core tensor. Finally, an improved odd-even quantization technique is employed to embed a watermark in the core tensor. Moreover, pseudo-Zernike moments and multiple output least squares support vector regression (MLS-SVR) network model are used for geometric distortion correction in the watermark extraction stage. The scheme utilizes the inherent correlations among the three RGB channels of a color image, and spreads the watermark into the three channels. The experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme has better fidelity and stronger robustness for common image-processing and geometric attacks, can effectively resist each color channel exchange attack.

Furthermore, a Brillouin optical time domain analysis (BOTDA) experimental system was built to verify the denoising algorithms. The princi-pal and experimental analyses show that the QWT algorithm is a more efficient image denoising method. The results indicate that the GS algorithm can obtain the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), frequency uncertainty, and Brillouin frequency shift (BFS) accuracy, and can be executed in an imperceptible time, but the GS algorithm has the lowest spatial resolution. After being denoised by using NLM algorithm, although SNR, frequency uncertainty, BFS accuracy, and spatial resolution significantly improved, it takes 40 min to implement the NLM denoising algorithm for a BGS image with 200 × 100,000 points. Processed by the QWT denoising algorithm, although SNR increases to 17.26 dB and frequency uncertainty decreases to 0.24 MHz, a BFS accuracy of only 0.2 MHz can be achieved. Moreover, the spatial resolution is 3 m, which is not affected by the QWT denoising algorithm. It takes less than 32 s to denoise the same raw BGS data. The QWT image denoising technique is suitable for BGS data processing in the BOTDA sensor system.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016930","afid":"60016930","affilname":"Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "8", "$" :"8"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57225896073","authid":"57225896073","authname":"Wei H.","surname":"Wei","given-name":"Haoyu","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016930"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55733886200","authid":"55733886200","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yongjun","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016930"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57224114220","authid":"57224114220","authname":"Wang Q.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Qiming","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016930"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57224107792","authid":"57224107792","authname":"Lu X.","surname":"Lu","given-name":"Xiya","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016930"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57224111146","authid":"57224111146","authname":"Wu H.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Hongxin","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016930"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57224110685","authid":"57224110685","authname":"Fan L.","surname":"Fan","given-name":"Lei","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016930"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204644301","authid":"57204644301","authname":"Li C.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Chao","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016930"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "8", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102700839","authid":"7102700839","authname":"Xin X.","surname":"Xin","given-name":"Xiangjun","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016930"}]}],"authkeywords":"Brillouin frequency shift retrieval | Brillouin optical time-domain analysis | Distributed sensing | Quaternion wavelet trans-form","article-number":"1334","source-id":"21100829272","fund-acr":"BUPT","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85104081449"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85104081449?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85104081449&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85104081449&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0895611121000495"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85104081449","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85104081449","eid":"2-s2.0-85104081449","dc:title":"Retinex model based stain normalization technique for whole slide image analysis","dc:creator":"Hoque M.Z.","prism:publicationName":"Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics","prism:issn":"08956111","prism:eIssn":"18790771","prism:volume":"90","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2021","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.compmedimag.2021.101901","pii":"S0895611121000495","dc:description":"Medical imaging provides the means for diagnosing many of the medical phenomena currently studied in clinical medicine and pathology. The variations of color and intensity in stained histological slides affect the quantitative analysis of the histopathological images. Moreover, stain normalization utilizing color for the classification of pixels into different stain components is challenging. The staining also suffers from variability, which complicates the automatization of tissue area segmentation with different staining and the analysis of whole slide images. We have developed a Retinex model based stain normalization technique in terms of area segmentation from stained tissue images to quantify the individual stain components of the histochemical stains for the ideal removal of variability. The performance was experimentally compared to reference methods and tested on organotypic carcinoma model based on myoma tissue and our method consistently has the smallest standard deviation, skewness value, and coefficient of variation in normalized median intensity measurements. Our method also achieved better quality performance in terms of Quaternion Structure Similarity Index Metric (QSSIM), Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM), and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) by improving robustness against variability and reproducibility. The proposed method could potentially be used in the development of novel research as well as diagnostic tools with the potential improvement of accuracy and consistency in computer aided diagnosis in biobank applications.","citedby-count":"17","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016622","afid":"60016622","affilname":"Oulu University Hospital","affiliation-city":"Oulu","affiliation-country":"Finland"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014009","afid":"60014009","affilname":"Faculty of Medicine","affiliation-city":"Oulu","affiliation-country":"Finland"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012954","afid":"60012954","affilname":"Oulun Yliopisto","affiliation-city":"Oulu","affiliation-country":"Finland"}],"pubmed-id":"33862354","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222811435","authid":"57222811435","orcid":"0000-0002-3154-2561","authname":"Hoque M.Z.","surname":"Hoque","given-name":"Md Ziaul","initials":"M.Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012954"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012954"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6507831793","authid":"6507831793","orcid":"0000-0002-1304-1413","authname":"Keskinarkaus A.","surname":"Keskinarkaus","given-name":"Anja","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012954"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012954"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006753067","authid":"7006753067","authname":"Nyberg P.","surname":"Nyberg","given-name":"Pia","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016622"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014009"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004242765","authid":"7004242765","orcid":"0000-0002-3963-0750","authname":"Seppänen T.","surname":"Seppänen","given-name":"Tapio","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012954"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012954"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color normalization | Computer aided diagnosis | Illumination estimation | Medical image analysis | Stain separation","article-number":"101901","source-id":"23607","fund-no":"318927","fund-sponsor":"Helsingin Yliopisto","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherhybridgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Hybrid Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85102989374"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85102989374?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85102989374&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85102989374&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85102989374","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85102989374","eid":"2-s2.0-85102989374","dc:title":"Robust zero-watermarking scheme based on novel quaternion radial fractional Charlier moments","dc:creator":"Yamni M.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","prism:issn":"13807501","prism:eIssn":"15737721","prism:volume":"80","prism:issueIdentifier":"14","prism:pageRange":"21679-21708","prism:coverDate":"2021-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2021","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11042-021-10717-2","dc:description":"In this paper, we propose a zero-watermarking scheme based on a new set of quaternion moments called Quaternion Radial Fractional Charlier Moments (QRFrCMs) for the copyright protection of color medical images.

The robustness of the proposed scheme is ensured thanks to robustness of the proposed quaternion moments against image processing attacks and geometric attacks where the BCR is greater than 98%. In addition, the scheme uses the fractional order of QRFrCMs and a chaotic system based on two-dimensional CML (2DCML) using mixed linear-nonlinear coupling to provide a high level of security. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed scheme over other recent schemes in terms of robustness against geometric attacks and common image processing attacks.

However, due to tissue deformation, complex camera motion and significant three-dimensional (3D) anatomical surface, image pixels may have non-rigid deformation and traditional mosaicking methods cannot work robustly for laparoscopy images in real-time. To solve this problem, a novel two-dimensional (2D) non-rigid simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system is proposed in this paper, which is able to compensate for the deformation of pixels and perform image mosaicking in real-time. The key algorithm of this 2D non-rigid SLAM system is the expectation maximization and dual quaternion (EMDQ) algorithm, which can generate smooth and dense deformation field from sparse and noisy image feature matches in real-time. An uncertainty-based loop closing method has been proposed to reduce the accumulative errors. To achieve real-time performance, both CPU and GPU parallel computation technologies are used for dense mosaicking of all pixels. Experimental results on in vivo and synthetic data demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our non-rigid mosaicking method.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002746","afid":"60002746","affilname":"Harvard Medical School","affiliation-city":"Boston","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"pubmed-id":"33690113","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55365601600","authid":"55365601600","orcid":"0000-0002-1334-8060","authname":"Zhou H.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Haoyin","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002746"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15725486800","authid":"15725486800","orcid":"0000-0002-3308-3012","authname":"Jayender J.","surname":"Jayender","given-name":"Jagadeesan","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002746"}]}],"authkeywords":"2D non-rigid SLAM | EMDQ | Image mosaicking | mismatch removal | uncertainty","article-number":"9374480","source-id":"16733","fund-acr":"NIH","fund-no":"K99EB027177","fund-sponsor":"National Institutes of Health","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85102087104"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85102087104?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85102087104&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85102087104&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0005109821000728"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85102087104","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85102087104","eid":"2-s2.0-85102087104","dc:title":"Nonlinear observer-based approach for cooperative control of networked rigid spacecraft systems","dc:creator":"Dong Y.","prism:publicationName":"Automatica","prism:issn":"00051098","prism:volume":"128","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2021","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.automatica.2021.109552","pii":"S0005109821000728","dc:description":"This paper considers the cooperative control problem for a multi-agent agent system composed of rigid spacecraft systems with quaternion-based attitude representation and a dynamic leader system, whose angular velocity is generated from a general nonlinear system.

Symplectic singular mode decomposition (SSMD) is an adaptive phase space reconstruction method based on symplectic geometry aiming at processing univariate signal. Quaternion singular spectrum analysis (QSSA) is a multivariate signal processing method in traditional Euclidean geometry, so basic features of original multivariate signals may be destroyed. Therefore, symplectic quaternion singular mode decomposition (SQSMD) is proposed to decompose multivariate signals to a series of independent meaningful components, meanwhile the method keeps essential features of raw multivariate time series unchanged. SQSMD applies symplectic similarity transformation to the constructed quaternion Hamilton matrix by selecting embedding dimension automatically without user-defined parameter, then the transformed trajectory matrix is decomposed by quaternion singular mode decomposition to obtain quaternion eigenvectors and singular values, and finally symplectic quaternion singular spectrum components (SQSSCs) are obtained by taking fault information from multivariate signals as a whole to enhance fault characteristics. Simulated and experimental multivariate signals results indicate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.","citedby-count":"13","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032356","afid":"60032356","affilname":"Hunan University","affiliation-city":"Changsha","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024350","afid":"60024350","affilname":"National University of Defense Technology China","affiliation-city":"Changsha","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222188966","authid":"57222188966","authname":"Ma Y.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Yanli","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8849330300","authid":"8849330300","authname":"Cheng J.","surname":"Cheng","given-name":"Junsheng","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202092966","authid":"7202092966","authname":"Hu N.","surname":"Hu","given-name":"Niaoqing","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36536858600","authid":"36536858600","authname":"Cheng Z.","surname":"Cheng","given-name":"Zhe","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7409385350","authid":"7409385350","authname":"Yang Y.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Yu","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"}]}],"authkeywords":"Gear fault diagnosis | Multivariate signals | Symplectic quaternion singular mode decomposition | Symplectic similarity transformation","article-number":"104266","source-id":"21094","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"51875183","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85100496976"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85100496976?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85100496976&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85100496976&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S016516842100061X"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85100496976","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85100496976","eid":"2-s2.0-85100496976","dc:title":"Wide-sense Markov signals on the tessarine domain.

This paper aims to explore tessarines as an alternative algebra to solve the estimation problem. More concretely, wide-sense Markov signals in the tessarine domain are introduced and their properties under properness properties are analyzed. Firstly, the T2-properness condition in the tessarine setting is defined and then, the linear estimation problem under tessarine processing is addressed. The equivalence between the optimal estimator based on tessarine widely linear processing and the one based on tessarine T2 processing is proved, thus attaining a notable reduction in computational burden. Next, the Ti-proper wide-sense Markov signals, i=1,2, are defined and a forwards representation for modeling them is suggested. Finally, the estimation problem with intermittent observations for this class of signals is tackled. Specifically, based on the forwards representation, two algorithms for the problems of filtering, prediction and fixed-interval smoothing are devised. Numerical simulations are developed where the superiority of the Ti estimators, i=1,2, over their counterparts in the quaternion domain is shown.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014586","afid":"60014586","affilname":"Universidad de Jaén","affiliation-city":"Jaen","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602299200","authid":"6602299200","authname":"Navarro-Moreno J.","surname":"Navarro-Moreno","given-name":"Jesús","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014586"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701415559","authid":"6701415559","orcid":"0000-0002-3128-8030","authname":"Ruiz-Molina J.C.","surname":"Ruiz-Molina","given-name":"Juan Carlos","initials":"J.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014586"}]}],"authkeywords":"Estimation | Intermittent observations | T -properness i | Tessarine processing | Wide-sense Makov signals","article-number":"108022","source-id":"25548","fund-acr":"FEDER","fund-no":"1256911","fund-sponsor":"Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85113471401"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85113471401?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85113471401&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85113471401&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85113471401","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85113471401","eid":"2-s2.0-85113471401","dc:title":"A new color image encryption effect evaluation method based on analytic hierarchy process and singular value decomposition","dc:creator":"Huayuan W.","prism:publicationName":"ACM International Conference Proceeding Series","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781450390200"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-05-28","prism:coverDisplayDate":"28 May 2021","prism:doi":"10.1145/3469213.3471349","dc:description":"This research discloses a method for evaluating the effect of color image encryption, which involves the field of image encryption evaluation technology.

The designed models optimize the misleading data from the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor on the drone caused by noise. A real test bench was constructed to verify the proposed methods.

Four different types of datasets are adopted, in which three datasets are randomly selected as the training ones, and the remainder as the test dataset to serve for unknown face anti-spoofing detection during training. The training datasets are regarded as three source domain datasets, which are input into the generation network to make a feature generator against three discriminators. When this feature generator successfully deceives the three discriminators, a feature space sharing three source domains and being different from these domains is formed to detect the characteristics of the unknown domain data. The triple constraint functions inter-class and intra-class are set up to improve the performance of the discriminator, and the detailed subbands of the hypercomplex wavelet transform and the convolution network are combined to learn the detailed features in multiple directions of images. Then the depth map and remote photo plethysmography signal are embedded in the feature space to enhance the generalization performance of the generated feature space for the living face features. The test dataset for discriminative classification in the feature space is used to obtain live/fake results. The results show that on the CASIA-FASD, Replay-Attack and NUAA datasets, the proposed algorithm gets the AUC of 84.65%, 86.06% and 91.21%, the HTER of 24.05%, 21.05% and 15.01%, which are higher than those of the comparative algorithms.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025945","afid":"60025945","affilname":"Lanzhou University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Lanzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018308","afid":"60018308","affilname":"Xi'an Jiaotong University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36699960500","authid":"36699960500","authname":"Li C.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Ce","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025945"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57213397627","authid":"57213397627","authname":"Li L.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Lan","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025945"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222004855","authid":"57222004855","authname":"Xuan S.","surname":"Xuan","given-name":"Shuxing","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025945"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190732204","authid":"57190732204","authname":"Yang J.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Jing","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018308"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57215374469","authid":"57215374469","authname":"Du S.","surname":"Du","given-name":"Shaoyi","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018308"}]}],"authkeywords":"Face anti-spoofing detection | Generative adversarial networks | Hypercomplex wavelet","source-id":"26196","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85104546253"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85104546253?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85104546253&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85104546253&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85104546253","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85104546253","eid":"2-s2.0-85104546253","dc:title":"Estimation of 6d object pose using a 2d bounding box","dc:creator":"Hong Y.","prism:publicationName":"Sensors","prism:issn":"14248220","prism:volume":"21","prism:issueIdentifier":"9","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 May 2021","prism:doi":"10.3390/s21092939","dc:description":"This paper provides an efficient way of addressing the problem of detecting or estimating the 6-Dimensional (6D) pose of objects from an RGB image. A quaternion is used to define an object′ s three-dimensional pose, but the pose represented by q and the pose represented by-q are equivalent, and the L2 loss between them is very large. Therefore, we define a new quaternion pose loss function to solve this problem. Based on this, we designed a new convolutional neural network named Q-Net to estimate an object’s pose. Considering that the quaternion′ s output is a unit vector, a normalization layer is added in Q-Net to hold the output of pose on a four-dimensional unit sphere. We propose a new algorithm, called the Bounding Box Equation, to obtain 3D translation quickly and effectively from 2D bounding boxes. The algorithm uses an entirely new way of assessing the 3D rotation (R) and 3D translation rotation (t) in only one RGB image. This method can upgrade any traditional 2D-box prediction algorithm to a 3D prediction model. We evaluated our model using the LineMod dataset, and experiments have shown that our methodology is more acceptable and efficient in terms of L2 loss and computational time.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029306","afid":"60029306","affilname":"Wuhan University","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003353","afid":"60003353","affilname":"Harbin Engineering University","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"33922124","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57223022368","authid":"57223022368","authname":"Hong Y.","surname":"Hong","given-name":"Yong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029306"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57867798600","authid":"57867798600","authname":"Liu J.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Jin","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029306"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57220208500","authid":"57220208500","authname":"Jahangir Z.","surname":"Jahangir","given-name":"Zahid","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029306"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57217408489","authid":"57217408489","authname":"He S.","surname":"He","given-name":"Sheng","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029306"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190810011","authid":"57190810011","authname":"Zhang Q.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Qing","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003353"}]}],"authkeywords":"6D pose estimation | Bounding Box Equation | LineMod | Quaternion","article-number":"2939","source-id":"130124","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"41271454","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85102619916"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85102619916?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85102619916&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85102619916&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1361841521000669"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85102619916","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85102619916","eid":"2-s2.0-85102619916","dc:title":"Fitting unbranching skeletal structures to objects","dc:creator":"Liu Z.","prism:publicationName":"Medical Image Analysis","prism:issn":"13618415","prism:eIssn":"13618423","prism:volume":"70","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May 2021","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.media.2021.102020","pii":"S1361841521000669","dc:description":"Representing an object by a skeletal structure can be powerful for statistical shape analysis if there is good correspondence of the representations within a population. Many anatomic objects have a genus-zero boundary and can be represented by a smooth unbranching skeletal structure that can be discretely approximated. We describe how to compute such a discrete skeletal structure (“d-s-rep”) for an individual 3D shape with the desired correspondence across cases. The method involves fitting a d-s-rep to an input representation of an object's boundary. A good fit is taken to be one whose skeletally implied boundary well approximates the target surface in terms of low order geometric boundary properties: (1) positions, (2) tangent fields, (3) various curvatures. Our method involves a two-stage framework that first, roughly yet consistently fits a skeletal structure to each object and second, refines the skeletal structure such that the shape of the implied boundary well approximates that of the object. The first stage uses a stratified diffeomorphism to produce topologically non-self-overlapping, smooth and unbranching skeletal structures for each object of a population. The second stage uses loss terms that measure geometric disagreement between the skeletally implied boundary and the target boundary and avoid self-overlaps in the boundary. By minimizing the total loss, we end up with a good d-s-rep for each individual shape. We demonstrate such d-s-reps for various human brain structures. The framework is accessible and extensible by clinical users, researchers and developers as an extension of SlicerSALT, which is based on 3D Slicer.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60114004","afid":"60114004","affilname":"Kitware, Inc.","affiliation-city":"Clifton Park","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60106890","afid":"60106890","affilname":"GE Healthcare United States","affiliation-city":"Chicago","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025111","afid":"60025111","affilname":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","affiliation-city":"Chapel Hill","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"pubmed-id":"33743355","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204835888","authid":"57204835888","authname":"Liu Z.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Zhiyuan","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025111"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57149210000","authid":"57149210000","authname":"Hong J.","surname":"Hong","given-name":"Junpyo","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60106890"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55039526000","authid":"55039526000","orcid":"0000-0001-6041-5580","authname":"Vicory J.","surname":"Vicory","given-name":"Jared","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60114004"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003877709","authid":"7003877709","authname":"Damon J.N.","surname":"Damon","given-name":"James N.","initials":"J.N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025111"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005852364","authid":"7005852364","authname":"Pizer S.M.","surname":"Pizer","given-name":"Stephen M.","initials":"S.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025111"}]}],"authkeywords":"Shape representation | Skeletal model | Statistical shape analysis","article-number":"102020","source-id":"17271","fund-acr":"NIBIB","fund-no":"R01EB021391","fund-sponsor":"National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099565611"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099565611?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85099565611&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85099565611&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099565611","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85099565611","eid":"2-s2.0-85099565611","dc:title":"DOA and Polarization Estimation for Non-Circular Signals in 3-D Millimeter Wave Polarized Massive MIMO Systems","dc:creator":"Wan L.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","prism:issn":"15361276","prism:eIssn":"15582248","prism:volume":"20","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"3152-3167","prism:coverDate":"2021-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May 2021","prism:doi":"10.1109/TWC.2020.3047866","dc:description":"In this article, a multiple signal classification (MUSIC) based algorithm is proposed for two-dimensional (2-D) direction-of-arrival (DOA) and polarization estimation of non-circular signals in three-dimensional (3-D) millimeter wave polarized massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The traditional MUSIC-based algorithms can estimate either the DOA and polarization for circular signals or the DOA for non-circular signals by using spectrum search. By contrast, based on the quaternion theory, a novel algorithm named quaternion non-circular MUSIC (QNC-MUSIC) is proposed for parameter estimation of non-circular signals with high estimation accuracy. Moreover, only the DOA estimation needs spectrum search, and the polarization estimation has a closed-form expression. First, the DOA estimation can be achieved based on the derivation principle. Then the closed-form expression of the polarization estimation can be obtained based on the chain rule of the derivation w.r.t. the polarization parameters. In addition, the computational complexity analysis shows that compared with the conventional DOA and polarization estimation algorithms, our proposed QNC-MUSIC has much lower computational complexity, especially when the source number is large. The stochastic Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) for the estimation of the 2-D DOA and polarization parameters of the non-circular signals is derived as well. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can improve the parameter estimation performance when large-scale/massive MIMO systems are employed.","citedby-count":"64","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073518","afid":"60073518","affilname":"Dongguan University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Dongguan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005465","afid":"60005465","affilname":"University of Electronic Science and Technology of China","affiliation-city":"Chengdu","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004538","afid":"60004538","affilname":"Dalian University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/109690857","afid":"109690857","affilname":"Tianjin Institute of Computing Technology","affiliation-city":"Tianjin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57213468755","authid":"57213468755","orcid":"0000-0003-0574-8360","authname":"Wan L.","surname":"Wan","given-name":"Liangtian","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56413375500","authid":"56413375500","orcid":"0000-0001-8885-6767","authname":"Liu K.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Kaihui","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073518"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36071330300","authid":"36071330300","orcid":"0000-0003-2671-5090","authname":"Liang Y.C.","surname":"Liang","given-name":"Ying Chang","initials":"Y.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/37562346700","authid":"37562346700","authname":"Zhu T.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Tong","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"109690857"}]}],"authkeywords":"Direction-of-arrival (DOA) and polarization estimation | non-circular signals | polarized large-scale/massive multiple-input-multiple-output (LS-MIMO/massive MIMO) | quaternion | three-dimensional (3-D) millimeter wave communication","article-number":"9316924","source-id":"18933","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"2019A1515111193","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85095751923"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85095751923?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85095751923&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85095751923&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85095751923","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85095751923","eid":"2-s2.0-85095751923","dc:title":"A simultaneous decomposition for three quaternion tensors with applications in color video signal processing","dc:creator":"He Z.H.","prism:publicationName":"Analysis and Applications","prism:issn":"02195305","prism:eIssn":"17936861","prism:volume":"19","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"529-549","prism:coverDate":"2021-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May 2021","prism:doi":"10.1142/S0219530520400084","dc:description":"In this paper, we establish a simultaneous decomposition for three quaternion tensors via Einstein product.
