Augmented reality (AR) has been introduced in the operating rooms in the last decade; however, in image-guided interventions, it has often only been considered as a visualization device improving traditional workflows. As a consequence, the technology is gaining minimum maturity that it requires to redefine new procedures, user interfaces, and interactions. The main contribution of this paper is to reveal how exemplary workflows are redefined by taking full advantage of head-mounted displays when entirely co-registered with the imaging system at all times. The awareness of the system from the geometric and physical characteristics of X-ray imaging allows the exploration of different human-machine interfaces. Our system achieved an error of 4.76 ± 2.91mm for placing K-wire in a fracture management procedure, and yielded errors of 1.57 ± 1.16° and 1.46 ± 1.00° in the abduction and anteversion angles, respectively, for total hip arthroplasty (THA). We compared the results with the outcomes from baseline standard operative and non-immersive AR procedures, which had yielded errors of [4.61mm, 4.76°, 4.77°] and [5.13mm, 1.78°, 1.43°], respectively, for wire placement, and abduction and anteversion during THA. We hope that our holistic approach towards improving the interface of surgery not only augments the surgeon's capabilities but also augments the surgical team's experience in carrying out an effective intervention with reduced complications and provide novel approaches of documenting procedures for training purposes.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true",

recovery in quaternion space. Due to the noncommutativity of quaternion multiplication, conventional optimization algorithms originally designed for real-valued and complex-valued signal recovery problems are not applicable to the optimization problem of QBSR. To combat this problem, we leverage several quaternion operators and devise an effective algorithm for QBSR within the ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) framework. The second contribution of this work is to develop a QBSR based classifier referred to as QBSRC for quaternion data classification with application to color face recognition. Compared with real-valued representation based classifiers handling multiple color channels of a color image independently, QBSRC treats a color image as a quaternion signal and represents it in a holistic manner. The third contribution is to provide the theoretical analysis of QBSRC and rigorously prove that QBSRC is guaranteed to succeed in classification of any new test sample under appropriate condition. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for quaternion signal recovery and classification.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188872929","authid":"57188872929","authname":"Zou C.","surname":"Zou","given-name":"Cuiming","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003837546","authid":"7003837546","authname":"Kou K.I.","surname":"Kou","given-name":"Kit Ian","initials":"K.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55568493500","authid":"55568493500","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yulong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404591899","authid":"7404591899","authname":"Tang Y.Y.","surname":"Tang","given-name":"Yuan Yan","initials":"Y.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]}],"authkeywords":"Block sparse representation | Quaternion representation | Signal recovery","article-number":"107849","source-id":"25548","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"11771130","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85092249942"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85092249942?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85092249942&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85092249942&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85092249942","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85092249942","eid":"2-s2.0-85092249942","dc:title":"Quaternion Spiking and Quaternion Quantum Neural Networks: Theory and Applications","dc:creator":"Bayro-Corrochano E.","prism:publicationName":"International Journal of Neural Systems","prism:issn":"01290657","prism:eIssn":"17936462","prism:volume":"31","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"February 2021","prism:doi":"10.1142/S0129065720500598","dc:description":"Biological evidence shows that there are neural networks specialized for recognition of signals and patterns acting as associative memories.

Since quaternions are well suited to represent 3D rotations, it is then well justified to extend real-valued neural networks to quaternion-valued neural networks for task of perception and control of robot manipulators. This work presents the quaternion spiking neural networks which are able to control robots, where the examples confirm that these artificial neurons have the capacity to adapt on-line the robot to reach the desired position. Also, we present the quaternionic quantum neural networks for pattern recognition using just one quaternion neuron.

facial expression, body posture and finger-spelling to convey meaning. With the development of recent technologies, such as Kinect sensor, new opportunities have emerged in the field of human computer interaction and sign language, allowing to capture both RGB and Depth (RGB-D) information. In the regard to feature extraction, the traditional methods process the RGB and Depth images independently. In this paper, we propose a robust static finger-spelling sign language recognition system adopting the Quaternion algebra that provide a more robust and holistical representation, based on fusing RGB images and Depth information simultaneously. Indeed, we propose, for the first time, a new sets of Quaternion Krawtchouk moments(QKMs) and Explicit Quaternion Krawtchouk Moment Invariants (EQKMIs). The proposed system is evaluated on three well-known finger-spelling datasets, demonstrate the performance of the novel method compared to other methods used in the literature, against geometrical distortion, noisy conditions and complex background, indicating that it could be highly effective for many other computer vision applications.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017021","afid":"60017021","affilname":"Université Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah","affiliation-city":"Fez","affiliation-country":"Morocco"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/125637963","afid":"125637963","affilname":"Faculty of Sciences and Technology","affiliation-city":null,"affiliation-country":null}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57207617462","authid":"57207617462","authname":"Elouariachi I.","surname":"Elouariachi","given-name":"Ilham","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"125637963"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193524950","authid":"57193524950","authname":"Benouini R.","surname":"Benouini","given-name":"Rachid","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"125637963"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12142694700","authid":"12142694700","authname":"Zenkouar K.","surname":"Zenkouar","given-name":"Khalid","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"125637963"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7801340942","authid":"7801340942","authname":"Zarghili A.","surname":"Zarghili","given-name":"Arsalane","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"125637963"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56426407100","authid":"56426407100","authname":"El Fadili H.","surname":"El Fadili","given-name":"Hakim","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017021"}]}],"authkeywords":"Finger-spelling Recognition | Krawtchouk | Moment Invariants | Quaternion Algebra | RST Invariants","article-number":"9287845","source-id":"21100204301","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85100294562"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85100294562?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85100294562&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85100294562&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85100294562","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85100294562","eid":"2-s2.0-85100294562","dc:title":"Privacy-Protected Color Face Recognition Using Double Random Phase Encoding and Quaternion Grassmann Average Networks","dc:creator":"Xu Z.","prism:publicationName":"Jisuanji Fuzhu Sheji Yu Tuxingxue Xuebao/Journal of Computer-Aided Design and Computer Graphics","prism:issn":"10039775","prism:volume":"33","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"116-125","prism:coverDate":"2021-01-20","prism:coverDisplayDate":"20 January 2021","prism:doi":"10.3724/SP.J.1089.2021.18378","dc:description":"To protect the privacy and improve the recognition accuracy, a method of color face privacy protection recognition based on double random phase encoding and quaternion Grassmann average networks is proposed. Firstly, three color components of each color face image are encoded into a pure quaternion matrix. Then the quaternion value matrix is performed double random phase encoding in quaternion gyrator domain. In order to conceal the content of color facial image, only a small part of encrypted data is randomly selected by using random binary amplitude mask and preserved for decryption. For the invisible decrypted face images, quaternion Grassmann average networks is employed to extract features and recognition rate is calculated by linear support vector machine. In case that the face template is leaked, alternative one can be reproduced by new random binary amplitude matrix, which makes face template cancelable and keeps original face images in safe. The four datasets were used including Aberdeen, Georgia Tech, Visible Light and YouTube Makeup and the recognition rates are compared with other three face image privacy protection methods, the experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method can effectively improve the recognition rates and it shows better robustness to the change of dataset.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104429","afid":"60104429","affilname":"Changzhou University","affiliation-city":"Changzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073560","afid":"60073560","affilname":"Jiaxing University","affiliation-city":"Jiaxing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020256","afid":"60020256","affilname":"Capital Normal University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018310","afid":"60018310","affilname":"Nanjing Medical University","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221732766","authid":"57221732766","authname":"Xu Z.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Zihan","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55849891700","authid":"55849891700","authname":"Shao Z.","surname":"Shao","given-name":"Zhuhong","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101867863","authid":"7101867863","authname":"Shang Y.","surname":"Shang","given-name":"Yuanyuan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205768977","authid":"57205768977","authname":"Chen B.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Bin","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073560"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204908307","authid":"57204908307","authname":"Bi H.","surname":"Bi","given-name":"Hui","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104429"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56900588600","authid":"56900588600","authname":"Xiang W.","surname":"Xiang","given-name":"Wentao","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018310"}]}],"authkeywords":"Cancelable face recognition | Double random phase encoding | Quaternion Grassmann average networks | Quaternion Gyrator transform","source-id":"25574","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099667370"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099667370?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85099667370&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85099667370&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099667370","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85099667370","eid":"2-s2.0-85099667370","dc:title":"Applying Deep Learning Techniques to Estimate Patterns of Musical Gesture","dc:creator":"Dalmazzo D.","prism:publicationName":"Frontiers in Psychology","prism:eIssn":"16641078","prism:volume":"11","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-01-05","prism:coverDisplayDate":"5 January 2021","prism:doi":"10.3389/fpsyg.2020.575971","dc:description":"Repetitive practice is one of the most important factors in improving the performance of motor skills. This paper focuses on the analysis and classification of forearm gestures in the context of violin playing. We recorded five experts and three students performing eight traditional classical violin bow-strokes: martelé, staccato, detaché, ricochet, legato, trémolo, collé, and col legno. To record inertial motion information, we utilized the Myo sensor, which reports a multidimensional time-series signal. We synchronized inertial motion recordings with audio data to extract the spatiotemporal dynamics of each gesture. Applying state-of-the-art deep neural networks, we implemented and compared different architectures where convolutional neural networks (CNN) models demonstrated recognition rates of 97.147%, 3DMultiHeaded_CNN models showed rates of 98.553%, and rates of 99.234% were demonstrated by CNN_LSTM models. The collected data (quaternion of the bowing arm of a violinist) contained sufficient information to distinguish the bowing techniques studied, and deep learning methods were capable of learning the movement patterns that distinguish these techniques. Each of the learning algorithms investigated (CNN, 3DMultiHeaded_CNN, and CNN_LSTM) produced high classification accuracies which supported the feasibility of training classifiers. The resulting classifiers may provide the foundation of a digital assistant to enhance musicians' time spent practicing alone, providing real-time feedback on the accuracy and consistency of their musical gestures in performance.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60113750","afid":"60113750","affilname":"Royal College of Music, London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032942","afid":"60032942","affilname":"Universitat Pompeu Fabra Barcelona","affiliation-city":"Barcelona","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015150","afid":"60015150","affilname":"Imperial College London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56560249600","authid":"56560249600","authname":"Dalmazzo D.","surname":"Dalmazzo","given-name":"David","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032942"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192088632","authid":"57192088632","authname":"Waddell G.","surname":"Waddell","given-name":"George","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60113750"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35280935600","authid":"35280935600","authname":"Ramírez R.","surname":"Ramírez","given-name":"Rafael","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032942"}]}],"authkeywords":"bow-strokes | CNN | CNN_LSTM | ConvLSTM | gesture recognition | LSTM | music education | music interaction","article-number":"575971","source-id":"21100216571","fund-acr":"H2020","fund-no":"688269","fund-sponsor":"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099820669"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099820669?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85099820669&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85099820669&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099820669","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85099820669","eid":"2-s2.0-85099820669","dc:title":"Quaternion processing techniques for color synthesized NDT thermography","dc:creator":"Venegas P.","prism:publicationName":"Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","prism:eIssn":"20763417","prism:volume":"11","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"1-24","prism:coverDate":"2021-01-02","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2 January 2021","prism:doi":"10.3390/app11020790","dc:description":"Infrared thermography is a widely used technology that has been successfully applied to many and varied applications. These applications include the use as a non-destructive testing tool to assess the integrity state of materials. The current level of development of this application is high and its effectiveness is widely verified. There are application protocols and methodologies that have demonstrated a high capacity to extract relevant information from the captured thermal signals and guarantee the detection of anomalies in the inspected materials. However, there is still room for improvement in certain aspects, such as the increase of the detection capacity and the definition of a detailed characterization procedure of indications, that must be investigated further to reduce uncertainties and optimize this technology. In this work, an innovative thermographic data analysis methodology is proposed that extracts a greater amount of information from the recorded sequences by applying advanced processing techniques to the results. The extracted information is synthesized into three channels that may be represented through real color images and processed by quaternion algebra techniques to improve the detection level and facilitate the classification of defects. To validate the proposed methodology, synthetic data and actual experimental sequences have been analyzed. Seven different definitions of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) have been used to assess the increment in the detection capacity, and a generalized application procedure has been proposed to extend their use to color images. The results verify the capacity of this methodology, showing significant increments in the SNR compared to conventional processing techniques in thermographic NDT.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028711","afid":"60028711","affilname":"Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia","affiliation-city":"Madrid","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010555","afid":"60010555","affilname":"Fundación CTA","affiliation-city":"Vitoria-Gasteiz","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006793","afid":"60006793","affilname":"Universidad de Oviedo","affiliation-city":"Oviedo","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55752634800","authid":"55752634800","orcid":"0000-0001-8508-057X","authname":"Venegas P.","surname":"Venegas","given-name":"Pablo","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028711"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010555"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6507926393","authid":"6507926393","orcid":"0000-0003-0551-3203","authname":"Usamentiaga R.","surname":"Usamentiaga","given-name":"Rubén","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006793"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603392676","authid":"6603392676","orcid":"0000-0001-5496-7362","authname":"Perán J.","surname":"Perán","given-name":"Juan","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028711"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56032112900","authid":"56032112900","authname":"Sáez De Ocáriz I.","surname":"Sáez De Ocáriz","given-name":"Idurre","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010555"}]}],"authkeywords":"Colorization | Dimensionality reduction | Infrared thermography | Non-destructive testing | Processing technique | Quaternion","article-number":"790","source-id":"21100829268","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85160090749"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85160090749?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85160090749&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85160090749&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85160090749","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85160090749","eid":"2-s2.0-85160090749","dc:title":"Asian Conference on Machine Learning, ACML 2021","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of Machine Learning Research","prism:eIssn":"26403498","prism:volume":"157","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2021","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 114 papers.

In this paper, the UR5e manipulator robot can automatically detect the object using computer vision through the camera as a sensor and OpenCV computer program. Geometrical transformations and statistical approaches transform picture data into position and orientation data for robot control. The system detects the center point coordinates and the orientation angle of the detected object. The coordinates obtained by the camera perception are transformed into robot perception. At the same time, the value of the orientation degree is converted into a quaternion form which becomes the rotational movement parameter for the end effector of the robot. Position and orientation data are sent to the robot controller from the ROS framework computer program via ethernet. The robotic arm can move towards the object, and the end effector can rotate accordingly. The experimental results prove successful recognition of object position and orientation.

Multi-component seismic acquisition suffer from the same sparse and irregular sampling problems as the single component data acquisition. Although researchers have proposed a series of methods to interpolate the irregularly missing multi-component seismic traces, most of these methods are based on real-valued quaternion algorithm. This results in the quaternion-based reconstruction processing losing the conjugate symmetry property. The computational time and cost of multi-component reconstruction are increased. In this paper, we expand the real quaternion model to complexified quaternion model via biquaternion algebra, and present a new vector POCS method via biquaternion Fourier transform to reconstruct 3C-3D data. The proposed method could fully utilize the conjugate symmetry property of the complexified quaternion data, and just only reconstructs the positive frequency slices of the observed 3C data. The computational efficiency is greatly improved. The proposed vector POCS method can also interpolate the 3C data whose components have different missing patterns. Finally, the synthetic data and a field 3C-3D VSP data set are used to examine the performance of the proposed method for multi-component reconstruction.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009409","afid":"60009409","affilname":"China University of Geosciences, Beijing","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56573045500","authid":"56573045500","authname":"Li F.","surname":"Li","given-name":"F.","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009409"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404475071","authid":"7404475071","authname":"Gao J.","surname":"Gao","given-name":"J.","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009409"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56295370600","authid":"56295370600","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Y.","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009409"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57742067000","authid":"57742067000","authname":"Lu J.","surname":"Lu","given-name":"J.","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009409"}]}],"source-id":"21101083777","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"2017YFC0307405","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85126688764"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85126688764?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85126688764&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85126688764&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85126688764","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85126688764","eid":"2-s2.0-85126688764","dc:title":"A Hypercomplex Tensor-SVD and Its Application","dc:creator":"Mizoguchi T.","prism:publicationName":"2021 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference, APSIPA ASC 2021 - Proceedings","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789881476890"}],"prism:pageRange":"179-186","prism:coverDate":"2021-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2021","dc:description":"Expressing multidimensional information as a value in hypercomplex number systems (e.g., quaternion, octonion, etc.) has great potential in signal processing applications.

In this paper, we present a new algebraic real translations of hypercomplex tensors in order to extend tensor-SVD (t-SVD) and related mathematical tools such as tensor tubal rank and tensor low tubal rank approximation into general (Cayley-Dickson) hypercomplex domain. We then propose an algorithmic solution to the hypercomplex tensor principal component pursuit based on a proximal splitting technique.

On the understanding that the brain is a hyper-complex system, describing it only through a linear statistical approach, mainly based on the comparison of differences in the magnitude of the power of the electroencephalographic signal between comparable conditions, leaves incomplete the part of the brain phenomenon that obeys non-linear laws. The present work explores the possibility of characterizing the entropic structure of a human brain, through the construction of order/chaos balance profiles. We proceeded to study the entropic content of the EEG signal, by estimating the Hurst exponent in segments of different sizes, for a set of data from 14 EEG electrodes (Emotiv Epoc Research Edition), taken in basal resting conditions, during 3-5 minutes with eyes closed. The EEG recordings of thirteen subjects (N=13) were studied for the low beta (13-21Hz) and high beta (22-30Hz) sub-bands, in four time-processing windows: 125ms, 250ms, 500ms, and 1s. In addition to obtaining the traditional Hurst estimator, the behavior of two derivatives of the Hurst exponent: the moving-Hurst (muHurst), and the mHurst, an estimator interpreted as a global entropic trend of the time series, were also evaluated. The results showed a clear differentiation between the entropic profiles obtained for low beta and high beta, for all individuals, as well as a different entropic structure of both sub-bands, when comparing Hurst exponents and their derivatives with different time processing windows. At the 1s scale (128 EEG frames), the average entropic content of the time series (muHurst) is relatively higher than the entropic load contained in the mid-term estimation of the whole signal (H(trad)). At the same time, estimates of mHurst, a derivative that assesses the overall entropic trend of the signal, indicated mostly lower entropic (more organized) content than estimates at shorter timescales. Our nonlinear exploration of the entropic structure of the brain revealed a wealth of details that can be used to complement the traditional characterization of the brain that linear approaches have provided so far. Our procedure allowed us to discern substantive differences between the entropic characteristics of the low beta and high beta EEG sub-bands. As well as individual differences within the group, potential substrates for the search of neural markers of psychological, pharmacological, or clinical utility.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60105370","afid":"60105370","affilname":"Universidad Bernardo O'Higgins","affiliation-city":"Santiago","affiliation-country":"Chile"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023383","afid":"60023383","affilname":"Universidad de Santiago de Chile","affiliation-city":"Santiago","affiliation-country":"Chile"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003126","afid":"60003126","affilname":"Universidad Metropolitana de Ciencias de la Educación","affiliation-city":"Santiago","affiliation-country":"Chile"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191250098","authid":"57191250098","authname":"Díaz H.A.M.","surname":"Díaz","given-name":"Hernán A.M.","initials":"H.A.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023383"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57460103100","authid":"57460103100","authname":"Gárate E.","surname":"Gárate","given-name":"Elías","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023383"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205645600","authid":"57205645600","authname":"Maureira F.","surname":"Maureira","given-name":"Fernando","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003126"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206174250","authid":"57206174250","authname":"Flores E.","surname":"Flores","given-name":"Elizabeth","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60105370"}]}],"source-id":"19700182801","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85124685840"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85124685840?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85124685840&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85124685840&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85124685840","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85124685840","eid":"2-s2.0-85124685840","dc:title":"Periodic DMP formulation for Quaternion Trajectories","dc:creator":"Abu-Dakka F.J.","prism:publicationName":"2021 20th International Conference on Advanced Robotics, ICAR 2021","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781665436847"}],"prism:pageRange":"658-663","prism:coverDate":"2021-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2021","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICAR53236.2021.9659319","dc:description":"Imitation learning techniques have been used as a way to transfer skills to robots. Among them, dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) have been widely exploited as an effective and an efficient technique to learn and reproduce complex discrete and periodic skills. While DMPs have been properly formulated for learning point-to-point movements for both translation and orientation, periodic ones are missing a formulation to learn the orientation. To address this gap, we propose a novel DMP formulation that enables encoding of periodic orientation trajectories. Within this formulation we develop two approaches: Riemannian metric-based projection approach and unit quaternion based periodic DMP. Both formulations exploit unit quaternions to represent the orientation. However, the first exploits the properties of Riemannian manifolds to work in the tangent space of the unit sphere. The second encodes directly the unit quaternion trajectory while guaranteeing the unitary norm of the generated quaternions. We validated the technical aspects of the proposed methods in simulation. Then we performed experiments on a real robot to execute daily tasks that involve periodic orientation changes (i.e., surface polishing/wiping and liquid mixing by shaking).","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60118240","afid":"60118240","affilname":"Department of Cognitive Robotics, TU Delft","affiliation-city":"Delft","affiliation-country":"Netherlands"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60103653","afid":"60103653","affilname":"Aalto University","affiliation-city":"Espoo","affiliation-country":"Finland"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009999","afid":"60009999","affilname":"Universität Innsbruck","affiliation-city":"Innsbruck","affiliation-country":"Austria"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54882427200","authid":"54882427200","authname":"Abu-Dakka F.J.","surname":"Abu-Dakka","given-name":"Fares J.","initials":"F.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60103653"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55556026600","authid":"55556026600","authname":"Saveriano M.","surname":"Saveriano","given-name":"Matteo","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009999"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56943287700","authid":"56943287700","authname":"Peternel L.","surname":"Peternel","given-name":"Luka","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60118240"}]}],"source-id":"21101076066","fund-no":"IPN 86-N30","fund-sponsor":"Academy of Finland","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85124537390"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85124537390?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85124537390&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85124537390&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85124537390","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85124537390","eid":"2-s2.0-85124537390","dc:title":"A CLASS OF CUBIC HYPERSURFACES AND QUATERNIONIC KÄHLER MANIFOLDS OF CO-HOMOGENEITY ONE","dc:creator":"Cortés V.","prism:publicationName":"Asian Journal of Mathematics","prism:issn":"10936106","prism:eIssn":"19450036","prism:volume":"25","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2021","prism:doi":"10.4310/AJM.2021.v25.n1.a1","dc:description":"We classify all complete projective special real manifolds with reducible cubic potential, obtaining four series.

First, an observer evolved on S3×R3 is developed guaranteeing asymptotic stability of the closed loop error signals starting from any initial condition. Afterwards, the observer is combined with the proposed controller such that the observer-based controller ensures asymptotic stability of the closed loop error signals starting from any initial condition.

The above-mentioned traditional processing methods will largely lose the effective information of the original image when performing color image retrieval. Aiming at the problem of effective feature description in content-based image retrieval, this paper proposes a color image retrieval method based on improved quaternion convolutional neural network. First, use the quaternion method to characterize the local texture feature LBP value and R, G, and B color information of the image, and use the quaternion discrete cosine transform (QDCT) as the theoretical basis to express the color image as a quaternion matrix form. Secondly, each component of the convolutional neural network is extended to the quaternion domain, and the quaternion matrix obtained above is directly input into the proposed neural network for training and classification. Finally, the result of image retrieval is obtained. Experiments show that this method significantly improves the performance of color image retrieval.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003640","afid":"60003640","affilname":"Northwest Normal University China","affiliation-city":"Lanzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35758063000","authid":"35758063000","authname":"Wei W.","surname":"Wei","given-name":"Weiyi","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003640"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202345426","authid":"57202345426","authname":"Li L.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Lei","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003640"}]}],"authkeywords":"color image retrieval | convolution neural network | quaternion | quaternion discrete cosine transform","source-id":"21101073549","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85123281074"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85123281074?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85123281074&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85123281074&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85123281074","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85123281074","eid":"2-s2.0-85123281074","dc:title":"Posture Calculation of Improved Complementary Filtering Algorithm Based on Quaternion","dc:creator":"Zhu Y.F.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - 2021 2nd International Symposium on Computer Engineering and Intelligent Communications, ISCEIC 2021","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781665441605"}],"prism:pageRange":"38-43","prism:coverDate":"2021-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2021","prism:doi":"10.1109/ISCEIC53685.2021.00016","dc:description":"Attitude calculation is a key technology used in many fields. Reliability and stability of attitude calculation are highly required in industrial design, which needs to adopt multi-sensor data fusion technology. The traditional complementary filtering algorithm has the problems of slow attenuation speed of stopband and steady-state error caused by constant drift of gyroscope. An improved complementary filtering algorithm based on quaternion is proposed for attitude calculation. By adding an integral link on the basis of complementary filtering, complementary filtering algorithm can make better use of accelerometers and magnetometers to compensate gyroscopes, reduce the steady-state error of the system and improve the stability of attitude solution System. An experimental platform based on STM32F103 was built for verification. The experimental results show, under static conditions, the improved complementary filtering algorithm is compared with the traditional complementary filtering algorithm, the stability of roll angle, pitch angle and heading angle are increased by 36.24%,32.0% and 18.0% respectively. Under dynamic conditions, the posture angle fluctuations calculated by the improved algorithm are smaller, and stabilization and convergence are faster. Compared to a conventional complementary filtering algorithm is controlled more easily.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010851","afid":"60010851","affilname":"Hohai University","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57422693000","authid":"57422693000","authname":"Zhu Y.F.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Yun Feng","initials":"Y.F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010851"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude algorithm | Complementary filtering | Multi-sensor | Quaternion | STM32","source-id":"21101073556","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
