However, current star trackers are optimized to maximize accuracy, at the exclusion of all else. Although this produces extremely capable systems, the lofty mass, power consumption, and cost that result are often contradictory to the requirements of smaller space vehicles. Thus, it is of interest to design smaller, lower cost, albeit reduced capability star trackers that can provide adequate attitude and rate determination to small, highly maneuverable, low-cost spacecraft. To meet physical requirements, appropriate constraints on memory, computational speed, and optics must been defined and included in the hardware selection and software design. The primary software algorithms must include functions to extract and centroid stars from image noise and to match star patterns between subsequent images or to a small on-board catalog. Multiple pattern matching algorithms can be implemented in a dynamic manner based on the number of stars present in the image and whether or not current rate information is available. This provides several modes of operation and graceful degradation of performance at higher angular rates. The algorithms used incorporate various aspects from open literature, but include appropriate modifications and improvements where applicable. Thresholding at low signal-to-noise ratios is accomplished via a statistical pre-filter to address high noise content. Centroiding examines the stellar shape to optimally set the aperture shutter time for different rotation rates. Pattern matching between frames implements a 'smart' star selection technique to avoid wasted time on stars that might not appear in both images. An n-vertex pattern match is performed against a star catalog that has been reduced either based on the probability that the stars would be used or by existing attitude information. Finally, quaternion solutions are generated using a recursive estimation technique. This paper discusses the analysis used to select hardware and predict system performance, as well as the algorithms that have been employed to determine attitude information and rotation rates of the spacecraft. The performance of these algorithms using computer simulated images, nighttime photographs, and images captured directly by star tracker prototypes are presented. © 2006 by Kara M.

Extensions to the case of 4 transmit antennas are reported in [4].","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009415","afid":"60009415","affilname":"The University of Texas at Dallas","affiliation-city":"Richardson","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269","afid":"60003269","affilname":"Princeton University","affiliation-city":"Princeton","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55994846500","authid":"55994846500","authname":"Das S.","surname":"Das","given-name":"Sushanta","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009415"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006800187","authid":"7006800187","authname":"Al-Dhahir N.","surname":"Al-Dhahir","given-name":"Naofal","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009415"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35586083000","authid":"35586083000","authname":"Calderbank R.","surname":"Calderbank","given-name":"Robert","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003269"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24476538500","authid":"24476538500","authname":"Chui J.","surname":"Chui","given-name":"Jimmy","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003269"}]}],"source-id":"21100204301","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84862608057"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84862608057?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84862608057&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84862608057&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84862608057","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84862608057","eid":"2-s2.0-84862608057","dc:title":"Quaternionic approach to the one-regular eight-band linear phase paraunitary filter banks","dc:creator":"Parfieniuk M.","prism:publicationName":"European Signal Processing Conference","prism:issn":"22195491","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2006-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2006","dc:description":"Besides perfect reconstruction and linear phase, regularity is a desirable essential property of filter banks for image coding as it is associated with the smoothness of the related wavelet basis. This paper shows how to constrain quaternionic factorizations of eightband linear phase paraunitary filter banks to have the first regularity structurally imposed. The result is not very general but some facts make it notable. Firstly, these systems are a direct extension of the standard eight-point discrete cosine transform (DCT) and this facilitates practical applications. Secondly, the first regularity eliminates the DC leakage which cause visually annoying checkerboard artifact. Finally, our solution offers clear advantages over the known ones as the regularity conditions are formulated directly in terms of quaternionic lattice coefficients. Namely, both regularity and losslessness can be easily preserved regardless of coefficient quantization unavoidable in finite-precision implementations.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002096","afid":"60002096","affilname":"Bialystok University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Bialystok","affiliation-country":"Poland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6506558733","authid":"6506558733","authname":"Parfieniuk M.","surname":"Parfieniuk","given-name":"Marek","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002096"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25937204400","authid":"25937204400","authname":"Petrovsky A.","surname":"Petrovsky","given-name":"Alexander","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002096"}]}],"source-id":"21100204301","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84862602754"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84862602754?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84862602754&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84862602754&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84862602754","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84862602754","eid":"2-s2.0-84862602754","dc:title":"Motion estimation using hypercomplex correlation in the wavelet domain","dc:creator":"Argyriou V.","prism:publicationName":"European Signal Processing Conference","prism:issn":"22195491","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2006-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2006","dc:description":"We present a novel frequency-domain motion estimation technique, which employs hypercomplex correlation in the wavelet domain.

The algorithm is based on the dual-tree quaternion wavelet transform (QWT). Each QWT coefficient features a magnitude and three phase angles; we exploit the fact that two of the phase angles are covariant with image shifts in the horizontal and vertical directions. By fusing phase information across multiple scales, we combat the phase unwrapping problem that has traditionally plagued phase-based disparity estimation techniques. The result is a linear-time algorithm that provides reliable estimates of both small and large image shifts. The algorithm is completely image-based; that is, it involves no extraction of feature points or other landmarks. It can be used as a front-end for image processing and computer vision tasks such as image registration, motion estimation, and stereo matching.

Partly, because there is no straightforward generalization of linear filters available for color. However the algorithms yield more accurate results when the correlation among color bands are exploited which shows fundamental difference to process the color images. Earlier work[8] reported the transformation of the color images using Quaternion Fourier Transforms and the realization of a holistic filter based on Quaternion convolution. Here, we discuss the rotor based convolution techniques, a generalization of the previous work, within a new mathematical framework in Geometric Algebra. Based thereupon, a novel hardware architecture is proposed. Experiments show the edge detection with this technique belong to a class of linear vector filter and is holistic in nature. It is tailored for image processing applications, providing an acceptable application performance requirements. The usefulness of the introduced approach was demonstrated by analyzing and implementing a computation intensive edge detection algorithm on this hardware.","citedby-count":"18","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025225","afid":"60025225","affilname":"University of Southampton","affiliation-city":"Southampton","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34880558800","authid":"34880558800","authname":"Mishra B.","surname":"Mishra","given-name":"Biswajit","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025225"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57225964310","authid":"57225964310","authname":"Wilson P.","surname":"Wilson","given-name":"Peterpr","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025225"}]}],"authkeywords":"Edge Detection | Geometric Algebra | Hardware | Rotor Convolution","source-id":"5400152619","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/51349169573"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/51349169573?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=51349169573&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=51349169573&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/51349169573","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:51349169573","eid":"2-s2.0-51349169573","dc:title":"Particle filter based pose and motion estimation with non-Gaussian noise","dc:creator":"Xuedong W.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"1424407265"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781424407262"}],"prism:pageRange":"979-982","prism:coverDate":"2006-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2006","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICIT.2006.372263","dc:description":"Pose and motion estimation from a monocular sequence of images is crucial for many robot vision tasks, and particle filtering (PF) which is based on sequential importance sampling (SIS) has drawn much attention in recent years due to its capacity to handle nonlinear and non-Gaussian dynamic problems.

In particular, the mutual information between resampled original and fused MS bands is used to measure the spectral quality, while the mutual information between the Pan image and the fused bands yields a measure of spatial quality. The rationale is that the normalized mutual information calculated either between any couple of bands, or between each MS band and the Pan image, should be unchanged after fusion, Le., when passing from the coarse scale of the MS data to the fine scale of the Pan image. Experimental results carried out on QuickBird and Ikonos data demonstrate that the results provided by the proposed information-theoretic method are in trend with analysis performed on spatially degraded data by means of such parameters as Walds's ERGAS, Wang and Bovik's QI, and the novel Q4 score index based on quaternions theory and recently proposed by the authors.

However, as defects of the EKF in nonlinear estimation, there exists estimated error, which affects the accuracy of the state estimation, when it is adopted in nonlinear estimation. In order to yield the higher accuracy of pose and motion estimation, the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) using the principle that a set of discretely sampled points can be used to parameterize mean and covariance was employed in this paper. Given a sequence of 2D monocular images of an moving object, using line features on the image plane as measured inputs and a dual quaternions to represent the 3D transformation, the indirect measurement solutions of pose and motion estimation from monocular vision is presented based on EKF and UKF with simulated data. Simulation results have shown that the UKF is a superior alternative to the EKF. © 2006 IEEE.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60083503","afid":"60083503","affilname":"Fujian University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Fuzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55899249000","authid":"55899249000","authname":"Xuedong W.","surname":"Xuedong","given-name":"Wu","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60083503"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36245234200","authid":"36245234200","authname":"Xinhua J.","surname":"Xinhua","given-name":"Jiang","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60083503"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36846491600","authid":"36846491600","authname":"Rongjin Z.","surname":"Rongjin","given-name":"Zheng","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60083503"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25228754500","authid":"25228754500","authname":"Jiashan H.","surname":"Jiashan","given-name":"Huang","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60083503"}]}],"article-number":"4078800","source-id":"85690","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34848820364"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34848820364?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=34848820364&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=34848820364&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34848820364","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:34848820364","eid":"2-s2.0-34848820364","dc:title":"Accuracy investigation on large blocks of high resolution images","dc:creator":"Passini R.M.","prism:publicationName":"Revue Francaise de Photogrammetrie et de Teledetection","prism:issn":"17689791","prism:issueIdentifier":"184","prism:pageRange":"34-40","prism:coverDate":"2006-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2006","dc:description":"A large block of QuickBird Basic Imagery has been analyzed for optimal control distribution and scene ties.

As the flying object, we consider a golf ball just after impact, whose speed ranges from 40 m/s to 80 m/s. As the sensing device, we employed a high-speed one-line CCD camera instead of employing multiple synchronized 2-D image sensors. On the equator and on its perpendicular great circle, black markers are painted to identify rotation angle. The line sensor captures the golf ball and markers when the ball passes through the image capturing plane. From the image, we estimate the rotation angle of the ball. The quaternion approach is used to estimate the rotation angle instead of the Euler angle expression to avoid the gimbal lock phenomenon. Simulations and experiments were carried out to show the validity of the method, and reasonable results were obtained. © 2006 ICASE.","citedby-count":"17","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030526","afid":"60030526","affilname":"Hosei University","affiliation-city":"Tokyo","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16642547300","authid":"16642547300","authname":"Kadowaki T.","surname":"Kadowaki","given-name":"Tomohiko","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030526"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57208407803","authid":"57208407803","authname":"Kobayashi K.","surname":"Kobayashi","given-name":"Kazuyuki","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030526"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12794035500","authid":"12794035500","authname":"Watanabe K.","surname":"Watanabe","given-name":"Kajiro","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030526"}]}],"authkeywords":"Golf ball | High-speed flying object | One-line CCD camera | Quaternion | Rotation angle","article-number":"4108718","source-id":"6300153122","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34249099301"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34249099301?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=34249099301&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=34249099301&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34249099301","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:34249099301","eid":"2-s2.0-34249099301","dc:title":"Jordan-algebraic approach to convexity theorems for quadratic mappings","dc:creator":"Faybusovich L.","prism:publicationName":"SIAM Journal on Optimization","prism:issn":"10526234","prism:volume":"17","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"558-576","prism:coverDate":"2006-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2006","prism:doi":"10.1137/050635560","dc:description":"We describe a Jordan-algebraic version of results related to convexity of images of quadratic mappings as well as related results on exactness of symmetric relaxations of certain classes of nonconvex optimization problems.

The observer design goal is to reduce the computational load of traditional nonlinear filters without sacrificing accurate and stable estimates in the presence of modeling uncertainties, disturbances, and measurement noise. The estimation routines are particularly suited to satellites (i.e. CATSAT) not equipped with gyroscopes which provide body rate measurements. (For gyro-equipped satellites, the proposed application can also provide angular rate data in the case of gyro failure, a common phenomenon.) Quaternions are used to parameterize spacecraft attitude. In particular, multiplicative quaternion corrections are applied to the SMO. The proposed Sliding Mode Observer uses continuous state propagation with discrete measurement corrections to estimate attitude quaternions and angular rates. This method is implemented on the CATSAT \"world\" simulation model. The observer yields satisfactory attitude and rate estimates in the presence of sensor noise, unknown bounded disturbances/uncertainties, and uncertain system parameters. © 2006 IEEE.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027646","afid":"60027646","affilname":"University System of New Hampshire","affiliation-city":"Durham","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003500","afid":"60003500","affilname":"The Ohio State University","affiliation-city":"Columbus","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16177799900","authid":"16177799900","authname":"Köprübasi K.","surname":"Köprübasi","given-name":"Kerem","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003500"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24067820500","authid":"24067820500","authname":"Thein M.","surname":"Thein","given-name":"May Win L.","initials":"M.W.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027646"}]}],"article-number":"1656470","source-id":"18692","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33947616638"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33947616638?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33947616638&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33947616638&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33947616638","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:33947616638","eid":"2-s2.0-33947616638","dc:title":"High resolution vector-sensor array processing based on biquaternions","dc:creator":"Miron S.","prism:publicationName":"ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - Proceedings","prism:issn":"15206149","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"142440469X"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781424404698"}],"prism:volume":"4","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2006-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2006","dc:description":"This paper presents a version of MUSIC algorithm for linear vector-sensor arrays based on a complexified quaternionic (biquaternionic) modelization of the output three-components vector-signals.
