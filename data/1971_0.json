It is shown that the algebra of all operators on a quaternionic Hilbert space is a real C*-algebra in which (a) every normal operator is unitarily equivalent to its adjoint and (b) every operator in the double commutant of a hermitian operator is hermitian. Unitary representations of locally compact abelian groups in quaternionic Hilbert spaces are studied and, finally, the complete structure theory of commutative von Neumann algebras on quaternionic Hilbert spaces is worked out. © 1971 American Mathematical Society.","citedby-count":"65","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000745","afid":"60000745","affilname":"University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign","affiliation-city":"Urbana","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36780147500","authid":"36780147500","authname":"Viswanath K.","surname":"Viswanath","given-name":"K.","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000745"}]}],"authkeywords":"Character group | Column | Functional calculus | Locally compact abelian groups | Measure algebra | Multiplicity theory | Quaternionic hilbert spaces | Quaternions | Row | Spectral theorem | Sym- plectic image | Unitary representations | Von Neumann algebra","source-id":"24689","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"}]}}]}}
