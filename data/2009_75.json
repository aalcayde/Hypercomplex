However, most of the proposed motion estimation approaches deal only with the luminance component of the images, although the color information is also important. The usual way to apply these techniques in color image sequences is to process each color channel separately. As proposed by Ell, Sangwine and Moxey, a more sophisticated approach is to handle the color channels in a \"holistic\" manner, using quaternions. We present a motion estimation approach which is based on the Hypercomplex (quaternionic) Phase Correlation of Moxey et al. We show that the quaternionic approach is computationally more efficient and more robust to sensor noise, compared with the corresponding three-channels-separately approach. With the assumption of smoothly time-varying velocities we propose the application of a weighted fuzzy c-means clustering procedure to the obtained velocity estimates. This renders the estimation more robust. A methodology in the hypercomplex Fourier transform domain for separating the moving objects/layers is also presented. An energy-minimization-based approach for the spatial assignment of the velocities and the creation of segmentation maps, is given. We furthermore show how to apply the motion estimation approach locally in space for the extraction of dense motion fields. Our experimental results and comparisons with state-of-the-art methodologies verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

This study examines the measurement properties of an optical tracking system utilised in the MRI room. The results were used to assess the suitability of the device to be used as a part of the control system of a surgical robot. The position and orientation of the instrument, MRI scanner and the patient are measured using an optical tracking system in the MRI room. The measurement data can be used to display the instrument used as a part of the image of the patient. The optical tracking system used in the MRI room can also be considered as a part of the control system of a robot located in the room. When considering such use, the operations of the measuring device in different measurement conditions must be known. In terms of robot control, it is important to know the deviation attributed to measurement when defining the translation vector and orientation between two trackers. Five measurement series were carried out using the measurement device to examine the deviation in the translation vector and orientation data between two trackers. The distance and position between the trackers were changed between the measurement series. During the measurement series, the measurement device was moved to different distances from the trackers and the translation vector and orientation between the trackers were defined on the basis of the measurement results obtained. The measurements showed that the deviation of the translation vector did not significantly change as the measurement distance increased, but the deviation of orientation data between different trackers increased significantly. Deviation in the translation vector increased as the distance between trackers increased, but deviation in orientation did not change significantly.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033191","afid":"60033191","affilname":"VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland","affiliation-city":"Espoo","affiliation-country":"Finland"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012954","afid":"60012954","affilname":"Oulun Yliopisto","affiliation-city":"Oulu","affiliation-country":"Finland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35423756800","authid":"35423756800","authname":"Junttila P.","surname":"Junttila","given-name":"Petri","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012954"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6601958410","authid":"6601958410","authname":"Nevala K.","surname":"Nevala","given-name":"Kalervo","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012954"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033191"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24176987400","authid":"24176987400","authname":"Kroneld P.","surname":"Kroneld","given-name":"Petter","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012954"}]}],"authkeywords":"MRI-compatible robot | Optical tracking | Quaternion","source-id":"21100305259","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84869464781"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84869464781?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84869464781&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84869464781&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84869464781","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84869464781","eid":"2-s2.0-84869464781","dc:title":"Hand-Eye Motion-Invariant Pose Estimation with Online 1-Step GA –3D Pose Tracking Accuracy Evaluation in Dynamic Hand-Eye Oscillation–","dc:creator":"Minami M.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Robotics and Mechatronics","prism:issn":"09153942","prism:eIssn":"18838049","prism:volume":"21","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"709-719","prism:coverDate":"2009-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2009","prism:doi":"10.20965/jrm.2009.p0709","dc:description":"This paper presents online pose measurement for a 3dimensional (3-D) object detected by stereo hand-eye cameras.

This work will be applied in Bio-logging which is an interdisciplinary research area at the intersection of animal behavior and bioengineering. It refers to the use of miniaturized adapted-animal systems for logging and/or relaying of data about an animal's movements, physiology and/or environment. Generally, accurate attitude measurements are obtained using accelerometer and magnetometer, but at low frequencies movements. Then, to improve the performance and precision of the attitude estimation at high frequencies, we propose to add gyroscope and to develop an approach relaying on a quaternion-based nonlinear filter for the tracking of rigid body attitude (orientation) and heading. The algorithm fuses data from low-pass sensors such as 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis magnetometer and high-pass sensor such as 3-axis gyroscope. Then, we exploit the sensor readings directly in the designed filter which lead to increase the computational requirements. Finally, the proposed approach is illustrated by an attitude estimation example in an experimental case of noisy measurements which shows the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

In particular, the feasibility of nonlinear techniques for the attitude control of small satellites using only magnetic actuators is becoming a topic of increasing interest in the literature. Since magnetic control systems are relatively lightweight, require low power and are inexpensive, they are attractive for small, inexpensive satellites in low Earth orbits. In this paper we present averaging-based feedback control laws that achieve three-axis stabilized nadir-pointing attitude. We propose nonlinear quaternion feedback laws.

Orthogonal space-time block codes efficiently combine space and time diversity, and they have been studied in detail. Polarization diversity has also been studied, however it is usually considered in a simple concatenation with other coding methods. In this paper, an efficient method for incorporating polarization diversity with space and time diversity is studied. The simple yet highly efficient technique is based on extending orthogonal space-time block codes into the quaternion domain and utilizing a description of the dual-polarized signal by means of quaternions. The resulting orthogonal space-time-polarization block codes have given promising results in simulations. In the example described in this paper, the achievable performance gain for two transmit and one receive antennas is approximately 6 dB at a bit error rate of 10-4 when compared with the Alamouti code. © 2009 Academy Publisher.","citedby-count":"20","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104143","afid":"60104143","affilname":"Franklin W.

The quaternion Ito SDE contains dissipative terms that ensure the mean-square stability of the process. Closed-form deterministic propagation equations are developed for the second-order moment of the quaternion. The quaternion filter produces the linear minimum- variance unbiased estimate of the quaternion from continuous observations with additive white noise. The filter gain computations include coupled Riccati equations of the estimation error matrix and of the quaternion second-order moment. These computations are not estimate-dependent and can therefore be performed off-line. The special case of gyro error white noise with independent identically distributed components is considered. The case of correlated components can be addressed straightforwardly. Additive gyro biases are easily handled via state augmentation. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations are performed in order to validate the Ito model and to illustrate the proposed filter accuracy. Comparative simulations of the novel filter and of a standard additive extended Kalman filter are performed both for attitude-only estimation and for attitude-bias estimation. For practical purposes, the novel modeling and filtering approach shows similar results as the standard approach when the process noise level is low. For high signal-to-noise ratio however, the numerical study suggests that the novel filter can increase the accuracy of a conventional Kalman by orders of magnitudes.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027161","afid":"60027161","affilname":"Ben-Gurion University of the Negev","affiliation-city":"Beer Sheva","affiliation-country":"Israel"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12778249200","authid":"12778249200","authname":"Choukroun D.","surname":"Choukroun","given-name":"Daniel","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027161"}]}],"source-id":"29585","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77951943943"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77951943943?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77951943943&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77951943943&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77951943943","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:77951943943","eid":"2-s2.0-77951943943","dc:title":"Complex diffusion on image graphs","dc:creator":"Seo D.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - International Conference on Image Processing, ICIP","prism:issn":"15224880","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781424456543"}],"prism:pageRange":"2969-2972","prism:coverDate":"2009-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2009","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413577","dc:description":"Complex diffusion was introduced in image processing literature as a means to achieve simultaneous denoising and enhancement of scalar valued images.

These obstructions prevent a continuous state feedback from solving the problem and also lead to robustness issues when (non-hybrid) discontinuous feedback is applied. In this paper, we extend a hybrid control strategy proposed in a companion paper for robust, global asymptotic stabilization of rigid body attitude to the case where translation is also considered. Through Lyapunov analysis, we develop quaternion-based hysteretic hybrid control laws in the kinematic and dynamic settings. In the dynamic setting, two control laws are derived: one from an energy-based Lyapunov function and one by backstepping. Robustness to measurement noise is asserted by employing recently developed stability theory for hybrid systems. A comparison between discontinuous and hysteretic feedback under measurement noise is shown in simulation. ©2009 IEEE.","citedby-count":"24","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029241","afid":"60029241","affilname":"University of California, Santa Barbara","affiliation-city":"Santa Barbara","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010065","afid":"60010065","affilname":"The University of Arizona","affiliation-city":"Tucson","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24450761900","authid":"24450761900","authname":"Mayhew C.G.","surname":"Mayhew","given-name":"Christopher G.","initials":"C.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029241"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8551925200","authid":"8551925200","authname":"Sanfelice R.G.","surname":"Sanfelice","given-name":"Ricardo G.","initials":"R.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010065"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004395540","authid":"7004395540","authname":"Teel A.R.","surname":"Teel","given-name":"Andrew R.","initials":"A.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029241"}]}],"article-number":"5400338","source-id":"87424","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77950173306"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77950173306?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77950173306&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77950173306&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77950173306","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:77950173306","eid":"2-s2.0-77950173306","dc:title":"Quaternion Grassmann-Hamilton-Clifford algebras: New mathematical tools for classical and relativistic modeling","dc:creator":"Girard P.R.","prism:publicationName":"IFMBE Proceedings","prism:issn":"16800737","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783642038815"}],"prism:volume":"25","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"635-637","prism:coverDate":"2009-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2009","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-03882-2_17","dc:description":"The paper presents new mathematical tools for classical and relativistic modeling based on a quaternion formulation of Clifford algebras which we shall call Grassmann-Hamilton-Clifford algebras.

The extension to quaternions is straightforward, but we show that special care must be put in the algorithm implementation because of the peculiar properties of quaternions. Differently from the standard single component approaches, the use of quaternion algebra gives us the capability of exploiting the vectorial nature of the multicomponent data. It results that quaternion deconvolution, either spiking or predictive, generally performs superiorly with respect to standard deconvolution because it better estimates the wavelet, that is decomposed onto the single components. This is of particular importance for those components with a low energy signal and when noise affects differently the various component traces. The advantages of our quaternion technique are discussed by means of synthetic and real data examples and are compared with results obtained through standard single-component deconvolution.

This study examines the measurement properties of an optical tracking system utilised in the MRI room. The results were used to assess the suitability of the device to be used as a part of the control system of a surgical robot. The position and orientation of the instrument, MRI scanner and the patient are measured using an optical tracking system in the MRI room. The measurement data can be used to display the instrument used as a part of the image of the patient. The optical tracking system used in the MRI room can also be considered as a part of the control system of a robot located in the room. When considering such use, the operations of the measuring device in different measurement conditions must be known. In terms of robot control, it is important to know the deviation attributed to measurement when defining the translation vector and orientation between two trackers. Five measurement series were carried out using the measurement device to examine the deviation in the translation vector and orientation data between two trackers. The distance and position between the trackers were changed between the measurement series. During the measurement series, the measurement device was moved to different distances from the trackers and the translation vector and orientation between the trackers were defined on the basis of the measurement results obtained. The measurements showed that the deviation of the translation vector did not significantly change as the measurement distance increased, but the deviation of orientation data between different trackers increased significantly. Deviation in the translation vector increased as the distance between trackers increased, but deviation in orientation did not change significantly. © (2009) Trans Tech Publications.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033191","afid":"60033191","affilname":"VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland","affiliation-city":"Espoo","affiliation-country":"Finland"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012954","afid":"60012954","affilname":"Oulun Yliopisto","affiliation-city":"Oulu","affiliation-country":"Finland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35423756800","authid":"35423756800","authname":"Junttila P.","surname":"Junttila","given-name":"Petri","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012954"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6601958410","authid":"6601958410","authname":"Nevala K.","surname":"Nevala","given-name":"Kalervo","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012954"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033191"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24176987400","authid":"24176987400","authname":"Kroneld P.","surname":"Kroneld","given-name":"Petter","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012954"}]}],"authkeywords":"MRI-compatible robot | Optical tracking | Quaternion","source-id":"21100305259","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70450192111"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70450192111?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=70450192111&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=70450192111&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70450192111","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:70450192111","eid":"2-s2.0-70450192111","dc:title":"Constrained marginal space learning for efficient 3D anatomical structure detection in medical images","dc:creator":"Zheng Y.","prism:publicationName":"2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, CVPR 2009","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781424439935"}],"prism:pageRange":"194-201","prism:coverDate":"2009-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2009","prism:doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2009.5206807","dc:description":"Recently, we proposed marginal space learning (MSL) as a generic approach for automatic detection of 3D anatom- ical structures in many medical imaging modalities. To accurately localize a 3D object, we need to estimate nine parameters (three for position, three for orientation, and three for anisotropic scaling). Instead of uniformly search- ing the original nine-dimensional parameter space, only low-dimensional marginal spaces are uniformly searched in MSL, which significantly improves the speed. In many real applications, a strong correlation may exist among pa- rameters in the same marginal spaces. For example, a large object may have large scaling values along all directions. In this paper, we propose constrained MSL to exploit this correlation for further speed-up. As another major contri- bution, we propose to use quaternions for 3D orientation representation and distance measurement to overcome the inherent drawbacks of Euler angles in the original MSL. The proposed method has been tested on three 3D anatomi- cal structure detection problems in medical images, includ- ing liver detection in computed tomography (CT) volumes, and left ventricle detection in both CT and ultrasound vol- umes. Experiments on the largest datasets ever reported show that constrained MSL can improve the detection speed up to 14 times, while achieving comparable or better detec- tion accuracy. It takes less than half a second to detect a 3D anatomical structure in a volume. ©2009 IEEE.","citedby-count":"36","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60084261","afid":"60084261","affilname":"Siemens USA","affiliation-city":"New York","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030398","afid":"60030398","affilname":"Temple University","affiliation-city":"Philadelphia","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028673","afid":"60028673","affilname":"Siemens AG","affiliation-city":"Munich","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8062522600","authid":"8062522600","authname":"Zheng Y.","surname":"Zheng","given-name":"Yefeng","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60084261"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603044053","authid":"6603044053","authname":"Georgescu B.","surname":"Georgescu","given-name":"Bogdan","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60084261"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191091290","authid":"57191091290","authname":"Ling H.","surname":"Ling","given-name":"Haibin","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030398"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404165802","authid":"7404165802","authname":"Zhou S.K.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"S.

The method is based on minimizing the sum of squared errors between the reference and the deformed frames resulting from the usual optical flow constraint by using an optimized conjugate gradient routine. This method does not require any user-defined parameters or penalty terms, which simplifies its use in a clinical setting. Using a mathematical phantom, the method was quantitatively compared to the principal axis method, as well as an iterative method in which the rotation matrix was represented by Euler angles. The quaternion-based method was shown to be substantially more accurate and robust across a wide range of extramyocardial activity levels than the principal axis method. Compared with the Euler angle representation, the quaternion-based method resulted in similar accuracy but a significant reduction in computation times. Finally, the quaternion-based method was investigated using a respiratory-gated cardiac SPECT acquisition of a human subject.

Various operators can be sequentially applied to the resulting images always using the same ordering. In this paper we propose to consider the result of a prior transformation to define the imaginary part of a complex image, where the real part is the initial image. Then, total orderings between complex numbers allow defining subsequent morphological operations between complex pixels. In this case, the operators take into account simultaneously the information of the initial image and the processed image. In addition, the approach can be generalised to the hypercomplex representation (i.e., real quaternion) by associating to each image three different operations, for instance a directional filter. Total orderings initially introduced for colour quaternions are used to define the derived morphological transformations. Effects of these new operators are illustrated with different examples of filtering. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030506","afid":"60030506","affilname":"Mines Paris - PSL","affiliation-city":"Paris","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102728753","authid":"7102728753","authname":"Angulo J.","surname":"Angulo","given-name":"Jesús","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030506"}]}],"source-id":"25674","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70249145535"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70249145535?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=70249145535&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=70249145535&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70249145535","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:70249145535","eid":"2-s2.0-70249145535","dc:title":"Structure tensor of colour quaternion image representations for invariant feature extraction","dc:creator":"Angulo J.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"3642032648"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783642032646"}],"prism:volume":"5646 LNCS","prism:pageRange":"91-100","prism:coverDate":"2009-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2009","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-03265-3_10","dc:description":"Colour image representation using real quaternions has shown to be very useful for linear and morphological colour filtering.

Leveraging the special properties of Alamouti matrices, we first show that spatial multiplexing of Alamouti signals retains the space-time diversity gain of Alamouti signaling using our proposed low-complexity Alamouti BLAST-MMSE (A-BLAST) Algorithm. Next, in contrast to traditional transmit diversity that focuses on STBC construction at the transmitter, this paper looks at transmit diversity from the perspective of the receiver. In other words, the receiver gets to choose the STBC's, which are favourable to the channel assuming a fixed BLAST receive algorithm. In a multiuserMAC setting, we first present a systematic methodology to exploit different decomposition structure in Alamouti matrices, each with different tradeoff between performance and decoding complexity using possibly different MIMO receive algorithms. We then demonstrate that the notion of angles (the inner product of two quaternionic vectors) between multiuser channels determines the performance of MIMO receive algorithms. As an application of the general theory, we transform the decoding problem for several types of Quasi-Orthogonal STBC (QOSTBC) into multiuser detection of virtual Alamouti users. Building upon our A-BLAST Algorithm, we propose new algorithms for decoding single-user and multiuser QOSTBC. In particular, we show that bit error probability is a function of the quaternionic angle between virtual users (for a single user) or multiple users. This angle varies with the type of QOSTBC and leads to a new form of adaptive modulation called code diversity, where feedback instructs the transmitter how to choose from a plurality of codes. © 2009 IEEE.","citedby-count":"48","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003269","afid":"60003269","affilname":"Princeton University","affiliation-city":"Princeton","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15072338600","authid":"15072338600","authname":"Tan C.","surname":"Tan","given-name":"Chee Wei","initials":"C.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003269"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35586083000","authid":"35586083000","authname":"Calderbank A.","surname":"Calderbank","given-name":"A.

The filter receives only noisy pose measurements from a laser-vision system aboard another satellite (chaser) at a close distance in a neighboring orbit. The filter estimates the full states, all the inertia parameters of the target satellite, and the covariance of the measurement noise. A comprehensive dynamics model that includes aspects of orbital mechanics is incorporated for accurate estimation. The discrete-time model, which involves a state-transition matrix and the covariance of process noise, is derived in closed form, thus rendering the filter suitable for real-time implementation. The statistical characteristics of the measurement noise is formulated by a state-dependent covariance matrix. This model allows additive quaternion noise, while preserving the unitnorm property of the quaternion. The convergence properties of the developed filter is demonstrated by simulation sand experimental results. These results also demonstrate that the filter can continuously produce accurate estimates of pose even when the vision system is occluded for tens of seconds.

The proposed approach consists of two registration steps. First, an initial registration is carried out for two volume images by applying Procrustes analysis theory to the two sets of 3D feature points representing object shapes. During this first stage, a volume image is segmented by using a geometric deformable model. Then, 3D feature points are extracted from the boundary of a segmented object. We conduct an initial registration by applying Procrustes analysis theory with two sets of 3D feature points. Second, a fine registration is followed by using a new measure based on the entropy of conditional probabilities. Here, to achieve the final registration, we define a modified conditional entropy (MCE) computed from the joint histograms for voxel intensities of two given volume images. By using a two step registration method, we can improve the registration precision. To evaluate the performance of the proposed registration method, we conduct various experiments for our method as well as existing methods based on the mutual information (MI) and maximum likelihood (ML) criteria. We evaluate the precision of MI, ML and MCE-based measurements by comparing their registration traces obtained from magnetic resonance (MR) images and transformed computed tomography (CT) images with respect to x-translation and rotation. The experimental results show that our method has great potential for the registration of a variety of medical images. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026511","afid":"60026511","affilname":"Honam University","affiliation-city":"Gwangju","affiliation-country":"South Korea"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019303","afid":"60019303","affilname":"Mokpo National University","affiliation-city":"Muan","affiliation-country":"South Korea"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007215","afid":"60007215","affilname":"Chonnam National University","affiliation-city":"Gwangju","affiliation-country":"South Korea"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56264852800","authid":"56264852800","authname":"Cho W.H.","surname":"Cho","given-name":"Wan Hyun","initials":"W.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007215"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/27169264900","authid":"27169264900","authname":"Kim S.W.","surname":"Kim","given-name":"Sun Worl","initials":"S.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007215"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56142653900","authid":"56142653900","authname":"Lee M.E.","surname":"Lee","given-name":"Myung Eun","initials":"M.E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007215"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23091127000","authid":"23091127000","authname":"Kim S.H.","surname":"Kim","given-name":"Soo Hyung","initials":"S.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007215"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8921212800","authid":"8921212800","authname":"Park S.Y.","surname":"Park","given-name":"Soon Young","initials":"S.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019303"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35902380300","authid":"35902380300","authname":"Jeong C.B.","surname":"Jeong","given-name":"Chang Bu","initials":"C.B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026511"}]}],"authkeywords":"Geometric deformable model | ITK | Modified conditional entropy | Quaternion | Rigid transformation | Spatial procrustes analysis | Volume image segmentation and registration","source-id":"11400153333","fund-acr":"NRF","fund-no":"KRF-2007-311-D00752","fund-sponsor":"National Research Foundation of Korea","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/58049196709"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/58049196709?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=58049196709&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=58049196709&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/58049196709","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:58049196709","eid":"2-s2.0-58049196709","dc:title":"Estimation of motions in color image sequences using hypercomplex Fourier transforms","dc:creator":"Alexiadis D.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","prism:issn":"10577149","prism:volume":"18","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"168-187","prism:coverDate":"2009-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2009","prism:doi":"10.1109/TIP.2008.2007603","dc:description":"Although the motion estimation problem has been extensively studied, most of the proposed estimation approaches deal mainly with monochrome videos. The most usual way to apply them also in color image sequences is to process each color channel separately. A different, more sophisticated approach is to process the color channels in a \"holistic\" manner using quaternions, as proposed by Ell and Sangwine. In this paper, we extend standard spatiotemporal Fourier-based approaches to handle color image sequences, using the hypercomplex Fourier transform. We show that translational motions are manifested as energy concentration along planes in the hypercomplex 3-D Fourier domain and we describe a methodology to estimate the motions, based on this property. Furthermore, we compare the three-channels-separately approach with our approach and we show that the computational effort can be reduced by a factor of 1/3, using the hypercomplex Fourier transform. Also, we propose a simple, accompanying method to extract the moving objects in the hypercomplex Fourier domain.
