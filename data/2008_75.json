On consideration of some shortcomings in classic methods, a new, quaternion-based, closed-form solution is presented here. The concept of quaternion and its operation rules were introduced first, then formulae for space resection based on unit quaternion were deduced. The new method uses unit quaternion to represent rotation. Based on the least square principle, the closed-form solution to unit quaternion is solved out first. Then the rotation matrix is obtained, and angular elements are derived. Lastly coordinates of projective centre is computed. The main advantages of the method are that initial values of exterior orientation parameters need not to be provided, and linearization for the collinearity equations is not involved in formula deduction, so iterative computing of exterior orientation parameters is avoided. The numerical experiments are done and results show the correctness and reliability of the method.","citedby-count":"22","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60172561","afid":"60172561","affilname":"Jiangxi Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Nanchang","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60080101","afid":"60080101","affilname":"East China Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Fuzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073652","afid":"60073652","affilname":"Tongji University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24721466100","authid":"24721466100","authname":"Guan Y.L.","surname":"Guan","given-name":"Yun Lan","initials":"Y.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073652"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60080101"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401754145","authid":"7401754145","authname":"Cheng X.J.","surname":"Cheng","given-name":"Xiao Jun","initials":"X.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073652"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55801857700","authid":"55801857700","authname":"Zhou S.J.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Shi Jian","initials":"S.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60080101"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60172561"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25630683600","authid":"25630683600","authname":"Liao Z.P.","surname":"Liao","given-name":"Zhong Ping","initials":"Z.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073652"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402684544","authid":"7402684544","authname":"Lu T.D.","surname":"Lu","given-name":"Tie Ding","initials":"T.D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60080101"}]}],"authkeywords":"Exterior orientation parameters | Rotation matrix | Spatial resection | Unit quaternion","source-id":"144612","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/37849036598"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/37849036598?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=37849036598&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=37849036598&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/37849036598","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:37849036598","eid":"2-s2.0-37849036598","dc:title":"A novel pose estimation algorithm based on points to regions correspondence","dc:creator":"McInroy J.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision","prism:issn":"09249907","prism:volume":"30","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"195-207","prism:coverDate":"2008-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"February 2008","prism:doi":"10.1007/s10851-007-0045-2","dc:description":"A novel pose estimation algorithm is put forward in this paper.

Such a system records directly on a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera a couple of diffraction patterns produced by small particles illuminated by a modulated laser diode. The numerical reconstruction is based on the wavelet transformation method. A 3D particle field is reconstructed by computing the wavelet components for different scale parameters. The scale parameter is directly related to the axial distance between a given particle and the CCD camera. The particle images are identified and localized by analyzing the maximum of the wavelet transform modulus (WTMM) and the equivalent diameter of the particle image (Deq). Afterwards, a 3D point-matching (PM) algorithm is applied to the pair of sets containing the 3D particle locations. In the PM algorithm, the displacement of the particles is modeled by an affine transformation. This affine transformation is based on the use of the dual number quaternions. Afterwards, the velocity-field extraction is performed. This system is tested with simulated particle field displacements and the feasibility is checked with an experimental displacement. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin/Heidelberg.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60112043","afid":"60112043","affilname":"Environnement Méditerranéen et Modélisation des Agro-Hydrosystèmes - (EMMAH)","affiliation-city":"Avignon","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032922","afid":"60032922","affilname":"Université de Rouen Normandie","affiliation-city":"Mont-Saint-Aignan","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192368395","authid":"57192368395","authname":"Malek M.","surname":"Malek","given-name":"Mokrane","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60112043"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004657640","authid":"7004657640","authname":"Lebrun D.","surname":"Lebrun","given-name":"Denis","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032922"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602491592","authid":"6602491592","authname":"Allano D.","surname":"Allano","given-name":"Daniel","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032922"}]}],"source-id":"12384","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099492048"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099492048?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85099492048&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85099492048&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099492048","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85099492048","eid":"2-s2.0-85099492048","dc:title":"Projective-space colour filters using quaternion algebra","dc:creator":"Ell T.A.","prism:publicationName":"European Signal Processing Conference","prism:issn":"22195491","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2008-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2008","dc:description":"Instead of mapping colour image pixels into Euclidean vectors as is conventionally done in colour image processing, we present the idea of using projective space mapping based on homogeneous coordinates. This approach offers a much richer set of geometric operations in the colour space compared to the Euclidean geometry operations that exist in classical colour spaces. The projective geometry of points (pixel values) is described and compared to the classical Euclidean view of pixel values as vectors. The use of homogeneous coordinates is introduced and the geometric operations that are possible are outlined. Then it is shown how colour image pixel values may be transformed into and out of homogeneous coordinates, based on a representation in both cases using quaternions.

In the formalism of quaternions, this canonic form has at most 4 quaternion coefficients. In the formalism of matrices and groups, the coefficients are 4-4 matrices, or members of the General Linear Group of order 4.

By making use of Slerp formula to accomplish uniform interpolation of camera attitude on the sampling cycles between two orientation images, new mathematic model based on unit quaternion for the reconstruction of the exterior orientation parameters of three-line images is set up.

It provides us an ideal and robust approach for the calibration and triangulation of three-line array CCD sensor.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60089932","afid":"60089932","affilname":"Zhengzhou Institute of Surveying and Mapping","affiliation-city":"Zhengzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55705939100","authid":"55705939100","authname":"Liu J.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Jun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60089932"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55713218500","authid":"55713218500","authname":"Wang D.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Donghong","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60089932"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56414442400","authid":"56414442400","authname":"Zhang Y.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Yongsheng","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60089932"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude | Orientation image | Quaternion | Spherical linear interpolation | Three-line | Triangulation","source-id":"21100248929","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/78651091815"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/78651091815?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=78651091815&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=78651091815&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/78651091815","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:78651091815","eid":"2-s2.0-78651091815","dc:title":"An adaptive Kalman filter for motion esitmation/prediction of a free-falling space object using laser-vision data with uncertain inertial and noise characteristics","dc:creator":"Aghili F.","prism:publicationName":"AIAA Guidance, Navigation and Control Conference and Exhibit","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781563479458"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2008-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2008","prism:doi":"10.2514/6.2008-7317","dc:description":"A computationally efficient, noise adaptive Kalman filter is presented for the motion estimation and prediction of a free-falling tumbling satellite (target). The filter receives only noisy pose measurements from a laser vision system aboard another satellite (chaser) at a close distance in a neighboring orbit. The filter estimates the full sates, all the inertia parameters of the target satellite, as well as the covariance of the measurement noise. A comprehensive dynamics model that includes aspects of orbital mechanics is incorporated for accurate estimation. The discrete-time model, which involves a state-transition matrix and the covariance of process noise, is derived in closed form, thus rendering the filter suitable for real-time implementation. The statistical characteristics of the measurement noise is formulated by a state-dependent covariance matrix. This model allows additive quaternion noise, while preserving the unit-norm property of the quaternion. The convergence properties of the developed filter is demonstrated by simulation and experimental results. These results also demonstrate that the filter can continuously produce accurate estimates of pose even when the vision system is occluded for tens of seconds. © 2008 by Government of Canada.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024436","afid":"60024436","affilname":"ESAB Welding and Cutting","affiliation-city":"Florence","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007248","afid":"60007248","affilname":"Canadian Space Agency","affiliation-city":"Longueuil","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113310934","afid":"113310934","affilname":"Space Technologies","affiliation-city":"Andover","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003923445","authid":"7003923445","authname":"Aghili F.","surname":"Aghili","given-name":"F.","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007248"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113310934"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701319457","authid":"6701319457","authname":"Parsa K.","surname":"Parsa","given-name":"K.","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007248"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113310934"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024436"}]}],"article-number":"2008-7317","source-id":"19700182054","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77953377779"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77953377779?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77953377779&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77953377779&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77953377779","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:77953377779","eid":"2-s2.0-77953377779","dc:title":"High-rate space-time block coding schemes","dc:creator":"Nguyen D.","prism:publicationName":"IEICE Transactions on Fundamentals of Electronics, Communications and Computer Sciences","prism:issn":"09168508","prism:eIssn":"17451337","prism:volume":"E91-A","prism:issueIdentifier":"11","prism:pageRange":"3393-3397","prism:coverDate":"2008-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2008","prism:doi":"10.1093/ietfec/e91-a.11.3393","dc:description":"A rate-6/4 full-diversity orthogonal space-time block code (STBC) is constructed for QPSK and 2 transmit antennas by applying constellation scaling and rotation to the set of quaternions used in Alamouti code.

The computational complexity for the SVD of an RB matrix is only one-fourth of that for the SVD of conventional quaternion matrices. Therefore, many useful image-processing methods using the SVD can be extended to a color image without separating the color image into three channels.

Moreover, the fast algorithms of FRQFT (FFRQFT) are yielded as well.

In 2004, Ku et al pointed out that Chien et al's scheme is insecure, and proposed an improved password-based remote user authentication scheme. In this paper, the security of Ku's scheme is analyzed. It is demonstrated that Ku's scheme still has some weaknesses: it cannot withstand against the parallel session attack; it is vulnerable to the password guessing attacks and another new attack; it cannot resist on changing time stamp attack. It is then concluded that Ku's scheme cannot achieve the security requirements as their claims. Based on the analysis, we find all the attacks are happened because of the simple computation of h(ci ⊕ Tj) in all the phases of remote authentication, thus we develop a hyper-complex chaotic hash scheme. It is evidently shown that the security of the improved remote user authentication scheme is efficiently enhanced. ©2008 IEEE.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010606","afid":"60010606","affilname":"East China Jiaotong University","affiliation-city":"Nanchang","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010432","afid":"60010432","affilname":"Soochow University","affiliation-city":"Suzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8846493500","authid":"8846493500","authname":"Zhu C.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Canyan","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010432"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55709254800","authid":"55709254800","authname":"Zhang L.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Lihua","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010606"}]}],"authkeywords":"Authentication | Chaotic map | Cryptanalysis | Security","article-number":"4590325","source-id":"12100156839","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/51549091208"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/51549091208?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=51549091208&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=51549091208&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/51549091208","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:51549091208","eid":"2-s2.0-51549091208","dc:title":"High-rate space-time block coding schemes","dc:creator":"Nguyen D.H.N.","prism:publicationName":"HUT-ICCE 2008 - 2nd International Conference on Communications and Electronics","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781424424269"}],"prism:pageRange":"176-179","prism:coverDate":"2008-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2008","prism:doi":"10.1109/cce.2008.4578953","dc:description":"A rate-6/4 full-diversity orthogonal space-time block code (STBC) is constructed for QPSK and 2 transmit antennas by applying constellation scaling and rotation to the set of quaternions used in Alamouti code.

When the aircraft changes in the roll, pitch or heading, it is necessary to track the real time attitudes to stabilize the antenna pointing. While the strapdown inertial navigation system can fulfill the requirement. The instant attitude updating is one of the main tasks of attitude measurement for strapdown system. Consideration of the real time ability and stable performance, a new derivation method of the transformation equations between quaternion and attitudes is proposed. The influence of angle motion in airplane on SAR imaging is analyzed based on the derived equations. The method given in the paper can highly reduce the operation of triangle function and improve the efficiency of the system.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027363","afid":"60027363","affilname":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019499","afid":"60019499","affilname":"Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57217435606","authid":"57217435606","authname":"Guo C.M.","surname":"Guo","given-name":"Chun Mei","initials":"C.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019499"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54790599900","authid":"54790599900","authname":"Wang Y.F.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yan Fei","initials":"Y.F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019499"}]}],"authkeywords":"Angle motion error | Direction cosine matrix | Motion compensation | Quaternion | SAR | Strapdown inertial navigation","source-id":"24290","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/43249088113"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/43249088113?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=43249088113&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=43249088113&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/43249088113","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:43249088113","eid":"2-s2.0-43249088113","dc:title":"Determining the rotational variables of a spatial group point object from the object's filtering results","dc:creator":"Furman Y.A.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Communications Technology and Electronics","prism:issn":"10642269","prism:volume":"53","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"78-89","prism:coverDate":"2008-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"January 2008","prism:doi":"10.1134/s1064226908010105","dc:description":"Solution of the problem of finding the rotational variables of the image of a spatial group point object (SGPO) from the results of filtering of this object is considered.

Comparing with the traditional methods, the hypercomplex processing methods can better describe the intrinsic color relationships of images. Hypercomplex correlation techniques have been widely used in many applications of color image processing. This paper analyzes and introduces the fast algorithms of the 2-D hypercomplex Fourier transform and hypercomplex correlation by using the traditional complex fast Fourier transforms. And our novel algorithms are proposed, which respectively calculate each part Fourier transform by FFT algorithm by means of separating a hypercomplex into a real part and other imaginary parts. When reverting the corresponding unit imaginary operators and combining the results of the real and imaginary parts Fourier transforms, we can get the hypercomplex results. The analytical results show that our algorithms are easier to implement and have less computing complexity than the known fast algorithms. Finally some new results by applying hypercomplex correlation into object tracking are introduced.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009860","afid":"60009860","affilname":"Fudan University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14619404200","authid":"14619404200","authname":"Jiang S.","surname":"Jiang","given-name":"Shu Hong","initials":"S.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009860"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36111080200","authid":"36111080200","authname":"Hao M.","surname":"Hao","given-name":"Ming Fei","initials":"M.F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009860"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55949856300","authid":"55949856300","authname":"Zhang J.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Jian Qiu","initials":"J.Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009860"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56969610100","authid":"56969610100","authname":"Hu B.","surname":"Hu","given-name":"Bo","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009860"}]}],"authkeywords":"Hypercomplex | Hypercomplex correlation and object tracking | Hypercomplex Fourier transform | Image processing","source-id":"24288","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
