Previous CRC and SRC are originally designed in the real setting for grayscale image-based FR. They separately represent the color channels of a query color image and ignore the structural correlation information among the color channels. To remedy this limitation, in this paper, we propose two novel RC methods for color FR, namely, quaternion CRC (QCRC) and quaternion SRC (QSRC) using quaternion ell -{1}minimization. By modeling each color image as a quaternionic signal, they naturally preserve the color structures of both query and gallery color images while uniformly coding the query channel images in a holistic manner. Despite the empirical success of CRC and SRC on FR, a few theoretical results are developed to guarantee their effectiveness. Another purpose of this paper is to establish the theoretical guarantee for QCRC and QSRC under mild conditions. Comparisons with competing methods on benchmark real-world databases consistently show the superiority of the proposed methods for both color FR and reconstruction.","citedby-count":"110","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188872929","authid":"57188872929","authname":"Zou C.","surname":"Zou","given-name":"Cuiming","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003837546","authid":"7003837546","authname":"Kou K.","surname":"Kou","given-name":"Kit Ian","initials":"K.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55568493500","authid":"55568493500","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yulong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]}],"authkeywords":"color image | face recognition | Quaternion collaborative representation | quaternion sparse representation","article-number":"7468463","source-id":"25534","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"11401606","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84965062501"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84965062501?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84965062501&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84965062501&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1047320316300463"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84965062501","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84965062501","eid":"2-s2.0-84965062501","dc:title":"Local quaternion PHT based robust color image watermarking algorithm","dc:creator":"Wang X.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation","prism:issn":"10473203","prism:eIssn":"10959076","prism:volume":"38","prism:pageRange":"678-694","prism:coverDate":"2016-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2016","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jvcir.2016.04.011","pii":"S1047320316300463","dc:description":"It is a challenging work to design a robust localized color image watermarking scheme against desynchronization attacks. There are two main drawbacks indwelled in current localized color image watermarking: firstly, the pure gray-based feature points detectors were utilized, in which the important color information is ignored. Secondly, the watermarking algorithms were designed mainly to mark the image luminance component only, in which the significant color channels correlation are neglected. In this paper, we propose a robust color image watermarking algorithm using local quaternion PHT (Polar Harmonic Transform), which is invariant to various noises, local geometric transformations, and color variations. Firstly, the stable color image feature points are extracted by using new color image feature point detector, in which the SIFER (Scale-Invariant Feature detector with Error Resilience) detector and color invariance model are incorporated. Then, the affine invariant local regions are built adaptively according to local image content variation. Finally, the digital watermark is embedded into the local regions by modulating the invariant quaternion PHT modulus coefficients. Experiments are carried out on a color image set collected from Internet, and the extensive experimental works have shown that the proposed color image watermarking is not only invisible and robust against common image processing operations such as median filtering, noise adding, and JPEG compression, but also has conquered those challenging desynchronization attacks.","citedby-count":"23","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017010","afid":"60017010","affilname":"Liaoning Normal University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972239800","authid":"34972239800","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiang Yang","initials":"X.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56604552600","authid":"56604552600","authname":"Liu Y.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Yu Nan","initials":"Y.N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189075447","authid":"57189075447","authname":"Han M.","surname":"Han","given-name":"Meng Meng","initials":"M.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972350300","authid":"34972350300","authname":"Yang H.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Hong Ying","initials":"H.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]}],"authkeywords":"Algebra of quaternions | Color image watermarking | Color invariance model | Desynchronization attacks | Polar harmonic transform | SIFER detector","source-id":"25592","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61272416","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960118001"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960118001?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84960118001&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84960118001&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960118001","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84960118001","eid":"2-s2.0-84960118001","dc:title":"Global and local saliency analysis for the extraction of residential areas in high-spatial-resolution remote sensing image","dc:creator":"Zhang L.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","prism:issn":"01962892","prism:volume":"54","prism:issueIdentifier":"7","prism:pageRange":"3750-3763","prism:coverDate":"2016-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2016","prism:doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2016.2527044","dc:description":"Extraction of residential areas plays an important role in remote sensing image processing. Extracted results can be applied to various scenarios, including disaster assessment, urban expansion, and environmental change research. Quality residential areas extracted from a remote sensing image must meet three requirements: well-defined boundaries, uniformly highlighted residential area, and no background redundancy in residential areas. Driven by these requirements, this study proposes a global and local saliency analysis model (GLSA) for the extraction of residential areas in high-spatial-resolution remote sensing images. In the proposed model, a global saliency map based on quaternion Fourier transform (QFT) and a global saliency map based on adaptive directional enhancement lifting wavelet transform (ADE-LWT) are generated along with a local saliency map, all of which are fused into a main saliency map based on complementarities. In order to analyze the correlation among spectrums in the remote sensing image, the phase spectrum information of QFT is used on the multispectral images for producing a global saliency map. To acquire the texture and edge features of different scales and orientations, the coefficients acquired by ADE-LWT are used to construct another global saliency map. To discard redundant backgrounds, the amplitude spectrum of the Fourier transform and the spatial relations among patches are introduced into the panchromatic image to generate the local saliency map. Experimental results indicate that the GLSA model can better define the boundaries of residential areas and achieve complete residential areas than current methods. Furthermore, the GLSA model can prevent redundant backgrounds in residential areas and thus acquire more accurate residential areas.","citedby-count":"77","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60124572","afid":"60124572","affilname":"Key Laboratory of Machine Perception, Ministry of Education","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023237","afid":"60023237","affilname":"Beijing Normal University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35325855000","authid":"35325855000","authname":"Zhang L.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Libao","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023237"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56215131600","authid":"56215131600","authname":"Li A.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Aoxue","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60124572"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55721645400","authid":"55721645400","authname":"Zhang Z.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Zhongjun","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023237"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55353851800","authid":"55353851800","authname":"Yang K.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Kaina","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023237"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive directional enhancement lifting wavelet transform (ADE-LWT) | image processing | quaternion Fourier transform (QFT) | remote sensing | saliency analysis","article-number":"7422740","source-id":"17360","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61071103","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84958794171"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84958794171?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84958794171&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84958794171&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84958794171","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84958794171","eid":"2-s2.0-84958794171","dc:title":"Uncertainty principles associated with quaternionic linear canonical transforms","dc:creator":"Kou K.I.","prism:publicationName":"Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences","prism:issn":"01704214","prism:eIssn":"10991476","prism:volume":"39","prism:issueIdentifier":"10","prism:pageRange":"2722-2736","prism:coverDate":"2016-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 July 2016","prism:doi":"10.1002/mma.3724","dc:description":"In the present paper, we generalize the linear canonical transform (LCT) to quaternion-valued signals, known as the quaternionic LCT (QLCT).

More recently, a few moment-based approaches were developed to embed watermark into color host image by marking the luminance component or three color channels, and they always cannot obtain better imperceptibility and robustness because of ignoring the correlation between different color channels. Quaternion is a generalization of the complex numbers, and can treat a color image as a vector field without losing color information. In this paper, based on algebra of quaternions and radial harmonic Fourier moments (RHFMs), we introduced quaternion radial harmonic Fourier moments (QRHFMs) for color images, which can be seen as the generalization of RHFMs for gray-level images. We analyzed and discussed the geometric invariant property of QRHFMs, and proposed a geometric invariant color image watermarking scheme using QRHFMs. Experimental results show that the proposed watermarking scheme not only provides better imperceptibility and robustness against various attacks (including common image processing operations and geometric distortions), but also yields better watermark detection performance than some state-of-the-art image watermarking schemes.","citedby-count":"32","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017010","afid":"60017010","affilname":"Liaoning Normal University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010432","afid":"60010432","affilname":"Soochow University","affiliation-city":"Suzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16205443400","authid":"16205443400","authname":"Niu P.p.","surname":"Niu","given-name":"Pan pan","initials":"P.p.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56244170000","authid":"56244170000","authname":"Wang P.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Pei","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56604552600","authid":"56604552600","authname":"Liu Y.n.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Yu nan","initials":"Y.n.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972350300","authid":"34972350300","authname":"Yang H.y.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Hong ying","initials":"H.y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972239800","authid":"34972239800","authname":"Wang X.y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiang yang","initials":"X.y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010432"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image watermarking | Geometric invariance | Imperceptibility | Quaternion radial harmonic Fourier moments | Robustness","source-id":"25627","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"L2013407","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84977512597"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84977512597?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84977512597&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84977512597&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84977512597","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84977512597","eid":"2-s2.0-84977512597","dc:title":"Attitude tracking sliding mode control using extended state observer for nonparallel-ground-track imaging","dc:creator":"Ye D.","prism:publicationName":"Yuhang Xuebao/Journal of Astronautics","prism:issn":"10001328","prism:volume":"37","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"720-728","prism:coverDate":"2016-06-30","prism:coverDisplayDate":"30 June 2016","prism:doi":"10.3873/j.issn.1000-1328.2016.06.012","dc:description":"A nonsingular and fast terminal sliding mode controller based on the extended state observer is designed for the nonparallel-ground-track imaging mode, whose ground targets and ground track are not parallel. First, the specific method of attitude adjustment for nonparallel-ground-track imaging satellite is studied to get the desired attitude trajectory. According to the tracking error dynamics and kinematics described by unit quaternion error, a nonsingular and fast terminal sliding mode controller is derived. Considering the disturbance rejection, an extended state observer is introduced to estimate the general disturbance which efficiently weaken the chattering inherent in sliding mode structure by reducing the switching gain. Furthermore, an adaptive fuzzy system is applied to approximate the switching term in the control law online to soften the control signal so as to effectively suppress the chattering. Finally, numerical simulations on the attitude tracking control for spacecraft in the presence of environmental disturbance and parameters uncertainties are performed, whose results show the designed control scheme can meet the requirements of control precision for the smart imaging with fast convergence speed and high control accuracy.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073440","afid":"60073440","affilname":"Beijing Institute of Control Engineering","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57215232481","authid":"57215232481","authname":"Ye D.","surname":"Ye","given-name":"Dong","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56941302100","authid":"56941302100","authname":"Tu Y.Y.","surname":"Tu","given-name":"Yuan Yuan","initials":"Y.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073440"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404240577","authid":"7404240577","authname":"Sun Z.W.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Zhao Wei","initials":"Z.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive fuzzy | Attitude tracking | Extended state observer | Remote sensing | Sliding mode control","source-id":"13628","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84982803737"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84982803737?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84982803737&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84982803737&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84982803737","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84982803737","eid":"2-s2.0-84982803737","dc:title":"A self calibrating star tracker system","dc:creator":"Tola E.","prism:publicationName":"2016 24th Signal Processing and Communication Application Conference, SIU 2016 - Proceedings","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781509016792"}],"prism:pageRange":"925-928","prism:coverDate":"2016-06-20","prism:coverDisplayDate":"20 June 2016","prism:doi":"10.1109/SIU.2016.7495892","dc:description":"Star trackers are optical devices that estimate their attitude by capturing sky images and identifying the observed stars through the use of pattern recognition algorithms and a star catalog.

Secondly, it processes the left view image, the right view image, the estimated disparity map, the estimated disparity-compensated right view image with QWT. Thirdly, it computes the energy and weight standard deviation of all image QWT coefficient. Then it computes the statistical feature entropy and median of the estimated disparity confidence map. At last, these features above are used as the input of ELM with kernel to predict the quality of the tested stereo images.

In the present research, we conducted imaging studies of 25 carotid Doppler images obtained by the Department of Cardiology at Firat University. After implementing fuzzy c-means segmentation and quaternion-based convolution on all Doppler images, we obtaineda model that can be analyzed easily by the doctors usinga bottom-up saliency model. These methods were applied to25 carotid Doppler images and then interpreted by specialists. In the present study, we used color-filtering methods to obtaincarotid color images. Saliency mapping was performed on the obtained images, and the carotid artery IMT was detected andinterpreted on the obtained images from both methods and the raw images are shown in Results. Also these results were investigated by using Mean Square Error (MSE) for the raw IMT images and the method which gives the best performance is the Quaternion Based Saliency Mapping (QBSM). 0,0014and 0,000191 mm2 MSEs were obtained for artery lumen diameters and plaque diameters in carotid arteries respectively. We found that computer-based image processing methods used on carotid Doppler could aid doctors’ in their decision making process.

the signal of interest (SOI). To tackle the problem, the spatial smoothing technique is adopted in quaternion domain to decorrelate the interferences by using linearly and uniformly spaced two-component electromagnetic vector-sensors. By averaging several translational invariant subarray quaternion covariance matrices, the quaternion spatial smoothing is performed to prevent the SOI cancellation phenomena caused by the presence of coherent interferences. It is demonstrated that the quaternion spatial smoothing Q-Capon beamformer can suppress the coherent interferences remarkably while the computational cost is lower than the complex domain long vector spatial smoothing counterpart. Theoretical analyses and simulation results validate the efficacy of the spatially smoothed Q-Capon beamformer in terms of coherent interference suppression capability.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016835","afid":"60016835","affilname":"Beijing Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192586797","authid":"57192586797","authname":"Liu Z.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Zhi Wen","initials":"Z.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190093660","authid":"57190093660","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Ya Xin","initials":"Y.X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24765534000","authid":"24765534000","authname":"Zhang X.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xi Rui","initials":"X.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16320275100","authid":"16320275100","authname":"Xu Y.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"You Gen","initials":"Y.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive beamforming | Electromagnetic vector-sensor array | Quaternion | Spatial smoothing","source-id":"19474","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61331019","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84944937575"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84944937575?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84944937575&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84944937575&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84944937575","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84944937575","eid":"2-s2.0-84944937575","dc:title":"A Modified Uncertainty Principle for Two-Sided Quaternion Fourier Transform","dc:creator":"Bahri M.","prism:publicationName":"Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras","prism:issn":"01887009","prism:eIssn":"16614909","prism:volume":"26","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"513-527","prism:coverDate":"2016-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2016","prism:doi":"10.1007/s00006-015-0617-y","dc:description":"This paper proposes a new uncertainty principle for the two-sided quaternion Fourier transform.

Although an intensive work has been done in developing GNSS Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) algorithms, a reliable procedure to mitigate multiple simultaneous outliers is still lacking. The presented work evaluates the performance of several methods for multiple outlier mitigation based on robust estimation framework and compares them to the performance of state-of-the-art RAIM methods. The relevant methods include M-estimation, S-estimation, LMS and RANSAC-based approaches as well as corresponding modifications for C/N0-based weighting schemes. The snapshot positioning methods are also tested within the quaternion-based Cubature Quadrature Kalman filter for integrated inertial/GNSS solution. The presented schemes are evaluated using real measurement data from challenging inland water scenarios with multiple bridges and a waterway lock. The initial results are encouraging and clearly indicate the potential of the discussed methods both for classical snapshot solutions as well for the methods with complementary sensors.","citedby-count":"20","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007798","afid":"60007798","affilname":"Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR)","affiliation-city":"Koln","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24802528500","authid":"24802528500","authname":"Medina D.A.","surname":"Medina","given-name":"Daniel Arias","initials":"D.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007798"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36716942200","authid":"36716942200","authname":"Romanovas M.","surname":"Romanovas","given-name":"Michailas","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007798"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190227158","authid":"57190227158","authname":"Herrera-Pinzon I.","surname":"Herrera-Pinzon","given-name":"Ivan","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007798"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602318661","authid":"6602318661","authname":"Ziebold R.","surname":"Ziebold","given-name":"Ralf","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007798"}]}],"authkeywords":"GNSS | Inertial Sensing | Integrated Navigation Systems | Kalman Filtering | PNT | Robust Estimation","article-number":"7479737","source-id":"21100468779","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84973348806"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84973348806?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84973348806&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84973348806&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84973348806","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84973348806","eid":"2-s2.0-84973348806","dc:title":"Closed-form solution to space resection based on homography matrix","dc:creator":"Huang X.","prism:publicationName":"Yaogan Xuebao/Journal of Remote Sensing","prism:issn":"10074619","prism:volume":"20","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"431-440","prism:coverDate":"2016-05-25","prism:coverDisplayDate":"25 May 2016","prism:doi":"10.11834/jrs.20165182","dc:description":"Space resection is the method of acquiring the exterior orientation parameters of a camera based on three ground control points (GCPs) at least and the corresponding image points. The traditional least squares method of space resection needs good initial values of exterior orientation parameters. However, good initial values are difficult to obtain in the oblique photogrammetry condition. The objective of this study is to compute accurate exterior orientation parameters automatically to provide good initial values for the least squares method of space resection. Solving the space resection problem needs three GCPs and the corresponding image points at least. This study initially starts from three GCPs and then derives a direct solution model of space resection. The three GCPs must be coplanar and the corresponding image points must also be coplanar. Thus, the homography matrix can be used to describe the geometric relationship between a set of coplanar points and another set of coplanar points. This study transforms the collinearity equation into a homography matrix model and derives two constraints based on the orthogonality of the rotation matrix. When only three GCPs exist, the space resection problem can be transformed into a set of binary quadratic equations. The binary quadratic equations have four solutions at most. An additional GCP is necessary to decide the unique solution. When three ground control points exist, the unique solution can be directly computed based on a set of linear equations, which are derived from the homography matrix model. After computing the homography matrix solution, the exterior orientation parameters can be obtained using the relationship between the homography matrix and collinearity equation. Three experiments tested the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method. The first experiment aimed to test the performance of the proposed method when only three GCPs exist. The experimental data comprise done oblique image of the Yangjiang area and four evenly distributed GCPs. Three of the GCPs were used to compute the exterior orientation parameters, and the remaining one was used to decide the unique solution. The proposed method was compared with the traditional range and imaging equation models. In the first experiment, the proposed method showed the best back substitution accuracy, which reached as high as 9.908010E-9 pixels. However, the back substitution accuracies of the range and imaging equation models were merely 5.891172E-6 pixels and 9.285811E-4 pixels, respectively. The second experiment aimed to show the influence of the proposed method on the least squares result of space resection in different camera angle conditions. Two different datasets were used in the second experiment. The first dataset was still the oblique image of the Yangjiang area. The initial values using the proposed method were compared with the values from the traditional method and the man-made methods. In the large camera angle condition, the least squares iteration based on the traditional method was unable to converge. The accuracy of the least squares results based on the proposed method was as good as that of the man-made initial values. Both methods had back projection accuracies of 0.03592 pixels. However, the convergence rate of the proposed method was good. The second dataset was an aerial image of the Toronto area. Given that the camera angle was small, the traditional method achieved good initial values. Accordingly, the proposed method was compared with the traditional method. In the small camera angle condition, the back projection accuracy of the proposed method was as good as that of the traditional method. The accuracy of both methods was 0.02525 pixels, but the convergence rate of the proposed method is better than the traditional one. The third experiment compared the proposed method with currently popular direct solution models of space resection in the case of multiple coplanar GCPs. Camera calibration data were used in the third experiment. The accuracy of the proposed method was better than that of the coordinate transformation and polynomial models, and was as good as the accuracy of the virtual GCP model. This study proposes a new direct solution model of space resection based on the homography matrix. It transforms the space resection model into a set of binary quadratic equations and acquires the direct solution of exterior orientation parameters. When multiple coplanar GCPs exist, the proposed method is able to transform the collinearity equation into a set of linear equations. Experimental results show that the proposed method can provide good initial values for the least squares method of space resection, which can be applied in oblique photogrammetry, close-range photogrammetry, and so on. Future studies will focus on acquiring direct solutions in the case of non-coplanar GCP s to improve the universality of the proposed method.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029306","afid":"60029306","affilname":"Wuhan University","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36816004500","authid":"36816004500","authname":"Huang X.","surname":"Huang","given-name":"Xu","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029306"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55577971100","authid":"55577971100","authname":"Zhang Y.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Yongjun","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029306"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189600555","authid":"57189600555","authname":"Yang J.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Jinglin","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029306"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189597949","authid":"57189597949","authname":"Ma L.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Lianwei","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029306"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54421630900","authid":"54421630900","authname":"Xiong X.","surname":"Xiong","given-name":"Xiaodong","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029306"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/43561306000","authid":"43561306000","authname":"Huang R.","surname":"Huang","given-name":"Rongyong","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029306"}]}],"authkeywords":"Closed-form solution | Co-planar points | Homography matrix | Space resection | Unit quaternions","source-id":"21100248003","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"41171292","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85009424618"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85009424618?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85009424618&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85009424618&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85009424618","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85009424618","eid":"2-s2.0-85009424618","dc:title":"MATEC Web of Conferences","prism:publicationName":"MATEC Web of Conferences","prism:eIssn":"2261236X","prism:volume":"59","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2016-05-24","prism:coverDisplayDate":"24 May 2016","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 48 papers.

Recently, the Conventional Disc-Harmonic Moments (CDHMs) are used to describe binary and gray scale images. In order to deal with color images in a holistic manner, these CDHMs are generalized as Quaternion Disc-Harmonic Moments (QDHMs) by using the quaternion algebra. Then the Rotation, Scaling and Translation (RST) invariants (CDHMIs and QDHMIs) are derived for more description of images that have undergone affine transformations. In this paper we first illustrate the discrimination power of these moments by evaluating their efficiency in image reconstruction application. Then we propose a new approach for human face recognition based on these moment invariants (CDHMIs and QDHMIs) as descriptors and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) as supervised learning models that analyze data and recognize patterns. Experimental results, obtained using two public datasets, show that the proposed approach is more efficient when the disc-harmonic moments are used instead of other existing descriptors.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60117237","afid":"60117237","affilname":"Laboratoire Informatique, Imagerie &amp; Analyse Numérique, Université Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah","affiliation-city":"Fez","affiliation-country":"Morocco"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56705428000","authid":"56705428000","authname":"Moujahid D.","surname":"Moujahid","given-name":"Driss","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60117237"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56955542300","authid":"56955542300","authname":"Elharrouss O.","surname":"Elharrouss","given-name":"Omar","initials":"O.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60117237"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14632764700","authid":"14632764700","authname":"Tairi H.","surname":"Tairi","given-name":"Hamid","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60117237"}]}],"authkeywords":"disc-harmonic moments | image reconstruction | moment invariants | pattern recognition | quaternion algebra","article-number":"7467699","source-id":"21100464914","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84984846196"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84984846196?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84984846196&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84984846196&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84984846196","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84984846196","eid":"2-s2.0-84984846196","dc:title":"The sensor fusion for accurate attitude measurement","dc:creator":"Jeon Y.H.","prism:publicationName":"Information (Japan)","prism:issn":"13434500","prism:eIssn":"13448994","prism:volume":"19","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"1493-1499","prism:coverDate":"2016-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May 2016","dc:description":"The Complementary filter is used in many signal processing algorithms in a simple way. We design the Complementary filter that is possible to design having the second or third Butterworth filter. The characteristic of complementary filter is that a gain in the passband makes uniform, and a rejection properties in the blocking band are good. We show the performance improvement to set the filter coefficients using the Q value that can determine the width of the passband. The Quaternion state value is the one of the posture representation method. The performance is improved through the simulation that composes two measurement period signals of angular speed and angle using the Quatemion value.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/117261029","afid":"117261029","affilname":"Jangwon University","affiliation-city":null,"affiliation-country":"South Korea"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57220772387","authid":"57220772387","authname":"Jeon Y.H.","surname":"Jeon","given-name":"Yong Ho","initials":"Y.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"117261029"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55330895100","authid":"55330895100","authname":"Lee S.W.","surname":"Lee","given-name":"Shin Won","initials":"S.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"117261029"}]}],"authkeywords":"Butterwortli filter | Complementary filter | Quaternion","source-id":"21100201065","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
