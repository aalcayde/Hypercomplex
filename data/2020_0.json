As a configurational space of rotations, it is proposed to consider a sphere with a radius of 2 π in the three-dimensional Euclidean space, which is the image of the unit Sp(1) quaternions. A linear relationship has been established between the angular velocity vector of a solid in its spherical motion and the velocity of a point in a sphere allowing to relate the rotation of a solid to the motion of a point inside a three-dimensional sphere. This approach allows to clearly interpret the spherical motion of a solid by the movement of a point inside this sphere, which is used by the authors to describe the rotation of a solid at arbitrary given boundary conditions for angular positions, velocities and accelerations.

In this study, twenty participants were instrumented with wearable inertial sensors placed above and below both knees while performing activities of daily living. Collected multivariate time series data were encoded as colour images and three convolutional neural networks were developed to classify activities into eleven classes. Performance was evaluated using twenty iterations of a leave-one-subject-out scheme. A first-stage classification model was able to differentiate static vs. dynamic activities almost perfectly and a second-stage model was able to further classify specific static activities performed with 99% accuracy. A separate second-stage model was developed to classify dynamic activities with 91% accuracy. Cycling and ascending/descending stairs were the most commonly confused activities. The current work has demonstrated that both static and dynamic activities of daily living can be classified using only leg instrumentation which is beneficial for applications studying knee performance in varying environments.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010884","afid":"60010884","affilname":"Western University","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202056400","authid":"57202056400","orcid":"0000-0002-2592-5515","authname":"Bloomfield R.A.","surname":"Bloomfield","given-name":"Riley A.","initials":"R.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010884"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23983469500","authid":"23983469500","orcid":"0000-0002-3911-3171","authname":"Teeter M.G.","surname":"Teeter","given-name":"Matthew G.","initials":"M.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010884"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603587438","authid":"6603587438","orcid":"0000-0001-7583-0496","authname":"McIsaac K.A.","surname":"McIsaac","given-name":"Kenneth A.","initials":"K.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010884"}]}],"authkeywords":"convolutional neural network | Human activity classification | multivariate time series | quaternion | wearable sensors","article-number":"9146536","source-id":"15047","fund-acr":"CIHR","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Canadian Institutes of Health Research","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089464189"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089464189?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85089464189&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85089464189&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0024379520303827"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089464189","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85089464189","eid":"2-s2.0-85089464189","dc:title":"Equivalence of slice semi-regular functions via Sylvester operators","dc:creator":"Altavilla A.","prism:publicationName":"Linear Algebra and Its Applications","prism:issn":"00243795","prism:volume":"607","prism:pageRange":"151-189","prism:coverDate":"2020-12-15","prism:coverDisplayDate":"15 December 2020","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.laa.2020.08.009","pii":"S0024379520303827","dc:description":"The aim of this paper is to study some features of slice semi-regular functions SEM(Ω) on a circular domain Ω contained in the skew-symmetric algebra of quaternions H via the analysis of a family of linear operators built from left and right ⁎-multiplication on SEM(Ω); this class of operators includes the family of Sylvester-type operators Sf,g. Our goal is achieved by a strategy based on a matrix interpretation of these operators as we show that SEM(Ω) can be seen as a 4-dimensional vector space on the field SEMR(Ω). We then study the rank of Sf,g and describe its kernel and image when it is not invertible, finding meaningful differences in the cases when the rank is either 2 or 3. By using these results, we are able to characterize when the functions f and g are either equivalent under ⁎-conjugation or intertwined by means of a zero divisor, thus proving a number of statements on the behaviour of slice semi-regular functions. In this way, information about the operator obtained by linear algebra techniques give as a significant application the solution of a problem in an area of function theory which had a remarkable development in the last decade (see [16]). We also provide a complete classification of idempotents and zero divisors on product domains of H.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031624","afid":"60031624","affilname":"Università Politecnica delle Marche","affiliation-city":"Ancona","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022778","afid":"60022778","affilname":"Università degli studi di Bari Aldo Moro","affiliation-city":"Bari","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56041637600","authid":"56041637600","authname":"Altavilla A.","surname":"Altavilla","given-name":"A.","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022778"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56629899100","authid":"56629899100","authname":"de Fabritiis C.","surname":"de Fabritiis","given-name":"C.","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031624"}]}],"authkeywords":"Idempotent functions | Matrix representation of Sylvester operators | Semi-regular functions | Slice-regular functions | Sylvester equation | ⁎-product of slice-regular functions","source-id":"24475","fund-acr":"INdAM","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica \"Francesco Severi\"","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099881942"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099881942?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85099881942&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85099881942&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099881942","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85099881942","eid":"2-s2.0-85099881942","dc:title":"Dual Quaternion Visual Servo Control","dc:creator":"Saltus R.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","prism:issn":"07431546","prism:eIssn":"25762370","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781728174471"}],"prism:volume":"2020-December","prism:pageRange":"5956-5961","prism:coverDate":"2020-12-14","prism:coverDisplayDate":"14 December 2020","prism:doi":"10.1109/CDC42340.2020.9303955","dc:description":"This paper focuses on a dual quaternion-based estimation and control approach for position-based visual servoing (PBVS). The pose estimation of the camera is achieved using a dual quaternion-based Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which estimates the position and orientation of the camera based on feature points acquired through a sequence of camera images. Based on the estimation, a dual quaternion control law is developed to regulate the camera to the desired pose. Leveraging the local exponential stability of the EKF and the global exponential stability of the designed controller, a nonlinear separation principle is used to prove the stability of the joint estimation and control for PBVS. The method is distinguished from other PBVS methods in the sense that a compact representation of dual quaternion is used to represent the pose, and a joint stability of estimator and controller for PBVS in dual quaternion space is presented. The proposed dual quaternion PBVS method is validated using a simulation.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022659","afid":"60022659","affilname":"University of Connecticut","affiliation-city":"Storrs","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211024211","authid":"57211024211","authname":"Saltus R.","surname":"Saltus","given-name":"Ryan","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022659"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203654500","authid":"57203654500","authname":"Salehi I.","surname":"Salehi","given-name":"Iman","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022659"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211018427","authid":"57211018427","authname":"Rotithor G.","surname":"Rotithor","given-name":"Ghananeel","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022659"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24922822300","authid":"24922822300","authname":"Dani A.P.","surname":"Dani","given-name":"Ashwin P.","initials":"A.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022659"}]}],"article-number":"9303955","source-id":"87424","fund-acr":"ONR","fund-no":"80NSSC19K1076","fund-sponsor":"Office of Naval Research","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099782316"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099782316?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85099782316&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85099782316&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099782316","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85099782316","eid":"2-s2.0-85099782316","dc:title":"Planar Feature-Constrained, Quaternion-Based Registration Algorithm for LiDAR Point Clouds","dc:creator":"Wang Y.","prism:publicationName":"Guangxue Xuebao/Acta Optica Sinica","prism:issn":"02532239","prism:volume":"40","prism:issueIdentifier":"23","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-12-10","prism:coverDisplayDate":"10 December 2020","prism:doi":"10.3788/AOS202040.2310001","dc:description":"The present work systematically discusses the planar-feature-based registration method of high-precision fusion of terrestrial LiDAR point clouds, wherein unit quaternion is used as the description operator of spatial rotation transformation. The 4-tuple representation method of planar features in three-dimensional (3D) space is given first. Then, the planar feature-based spatial similarity transformation model is constructed on the basis of ensuring the uniqueness of those planar features' mathematical expressions. Using the parameter equivalent of each conjugate planar features after registration as the constraint condition, the objective function of the 3D spatial similarity transformation is constructed according to the least square criterion, and the iterative solution of the registration parameters is analyzed according to the extremum of the function. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of the algorithm are verified by two sets of LiDAR point cloud data. Results show that in solving the spatial similarity transformation parameters, the 4-tuple expression method of planar features is used in judging the consistency of the same-name features after registration through the condition constraints of the parameter equivalent. Simultaneously, the two constraints of normal consistency and distance zero between the same-name plane features are considered. Introducing quaternion makes the expressions of the spatial similarity transformation model more concise, and there are fewer additional constraints in during registration. In the experimental scheme, given any initial value of an unknown parameter, the proposed algorithm can run and get correct results.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073460","afid":"60073460","affilname":"China University of Mining and Technology","affiliation-city":"Xuzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/20436472100","authid":"20436472100","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yongbo","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073460"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073460"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55951608000","authid":"55951608000","authname":"Zheng N.","surname":"Zheng","given-name":"Nanshan","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073460"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073460"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7103314735","authid":"7103314735","authname":"Bian Z.","surname":"Bian","given-name":"Zhengfu","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073460"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073460"}]}],"authkeywords":"Image processing | LiDAR | Point cloud | Quaternion | Registration | Spatial similarity transformation","article-number":"2310001","source-id":"29717","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85103769774"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85103769774?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85103769774&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85103769774&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85103769774","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85103769774","eid":"2-s2.0-85103769774","dc:title":"2020 International Symposium on Autonomous Systems, ISAS 2020","prism:publicationName":"2020 International Symposium on Autonomous Systems, ISAS 2020","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781665418829"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-12-06","prism:coverDisplayDate":"6 December 2020","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 48 papers.

The ECG beats give useful information about the status of the monitored heart condition. Up to now, various artificial intelligence-based methods have been proposed for ECG based heart failure detection. These methods were generally based on either time or frequency domain signal processing routines. In this study, we propose a different approach for ECG beat classification. The proposed approach is based on image processing. Thus, the initial step of the proposed work is converting the ECG beat signals to the ECG beat images. To do that, the ECG beat snapshots are initially saved as ECG beat images and then local feature descriptors are considered for feature extraction from ECG beat images. Eight local feature descriptors namely Local Binary Patterns, Frequency Decoded LBP, Quaternionic Local Ranking Binary Pattern, Binary Gabor Pattern, Local Phase Quantization, Binarized Statistical Image Features, CENsus TRansform hISTogram and Pyramid Histogram of Oriented Gradients are considered for feature extraction. The Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier is used in the classification stage of the study. Linear, Quadratic, Cubic and Gaussian kernel functions are used in the SVM classifier. Five types of ECG beats from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset are considered in experiments and the classification accuracy is used for performance measure. To construct a balanced training and test sets, 5000 and 10,000 ECG beat samples are randomly selected and are used in experiments in tenfold cross-validation fashion. The obtained results show that the proposed method is quite efficient where the calculated accuracy score is 99.9% and the comparisons with the state-of-the-art method show that the proposed method outperforms other methods.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60118438","afid":"60118438","affilname":"Sulaimani Polytechnic University","affiliation-city":"Sulaymaniyah","affiliation-country":"Iraq"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004863","afid":"60004863","affilname":"Firat Üniversitesi","affiliation-city":"Elazig","affiliation-country":"Turkey"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216583032","authid":"57216583032","authname":"Abdullah D.A.","surname":"Abdullah","given-name":"Daban Abdulsalam","initials":"D.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60118438"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219959131","authid":"57219959131","authname":"Akpınar M.H.","surname":"Akpınar","given-name":"Muhammed H.","initials":"M.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004863"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12545159900","authid":"12545159900","orcid":"0000-0003-1614-2639","authname":"Şengür A.","surname":"Şengür","given-name":"Abdulkadir","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004863"}]}],"authkeywords":"Arrhythmia detection | ECG beats | Local feature descriptors | Support vector machines","article-number":"20","source-id":"21100853958","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85097332932"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85097332932?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85097332932&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85097332932&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85097332932","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85097332932","eid":"2-s2.0-85097332932","dc:title":"Near orthogonal discrete quaternion Fourier transform components via an optimal frequency rescaling approach","dc:creator":"Hu L.","prism:publicationName":"IET Signal Processing","prism:issn":"17519675","prism:eIssn":"17519683","prism:volume":"14","prism:issueIdentifier":"9","prism:pageRange":"634-642","prism:coverDate":"2020-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 December 2020","prism:doi":"10.1049/iet-spr.2020.0199","dc:description":"The quaternion-valued signals consist of four signal components. The discrete quaternion Fourier transform is to map these four signal components in the time domain to that in the frequency domain. These four signal components in the frequency domain are called the discrete quaternion Fourier transform components. There are a total of 16 inner products among any two discrete quaternion Fourier transform components. The total orthogonal error among the discrete quaternion Fourier transform components is defined based on these 16 inner products. This study aims to find the optimal quaternion number in the discrete quaternion Fourier transforms so that the total orthogonal errors among the discrete quaternion Fourier transform components are minimised. It is worth noting that finding the optimal quaternion number in the discrete quaternion Fourier transform is equivalent to finding the optimal rescaling factors. Since the discrete quaternion Fourier transform components are expressed in terms of the high-order polynomials of the trigonometric functions of the rescaling factors, this optimisation problem is non-convex. To address this problem, a two-stage approach is employed for finding the solution to the optimisation problem.

The drone navigation problem consists of two parts. The first part is finding the real position and orientation of the drone. The second part is finding the difference between desirable and real position and orientation of the drone and creation of the correspondent control signal for decreasing the difference. For the first part of the drone navigation problem, the paper presents a method for determining the coordinates of the drone camera with respect to known three-dimensional (3D) ground objects using deep learning. The algorithm has two stages. It causes the algorithm to be easy for interpretation by artificial neural network (ANN) and consequently increases its accuracy. At the first stage, we use the first ANN to find coordinates of the object origin projection. At the second stage, we use the second ANN to find the drone camera position and orientation. The algorithm has high accuracy (these errors were found for the validation set of images as differences between positions and orientations, obtained from a pretrained artificial neural network, and known positions and orientations), it is not sensitive to interference associated with changes in lighting, the appearance of external moving objects and the other phenomena where other methods of visual navigation are not effective. For the second part of the drone navigation problem, the paper presents a method for stabilization of drone flight controlled by autopilot with time delay. Indeed, image processing for navigation demands a lot of time and results in a time delay. However, the proposed method allows to get stable control in the presence of this time delay.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60080064","afid":"60080064","affilname":"Ariel University","affiliation-city":"Ariel","affiliation-country":"Israel"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/125506792","afid":"125506792","affilname":"Transist Video Llc","affiliation-city":"Skolkovo, Moscow","affiliation-country":"Russian Federation"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36704747000","authid":"36704747000","authname":"Kupervasser O.","surname":"Kupervasser","given-name":"Oleg","initials":"O.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60080064"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"125506792"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211536402","authid":"57211536402","authname":"Kutomanov H.","surname":"Kutomanov","given-name":"Hennadii","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60080064"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57220205303","authid":"57220205303","authname":"Levi O.","surname":"Levi","given-name":"Ori","initials":"O.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60080064"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57220211639","authid":"57220211639","authname":"Pukshansky V.","surname":"Pukshansky","given-name":"Vladislav","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60080064"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55960217000","authid":"55960217000","authname":"Yavich R.","surname":"Yavich","given-name":"Roman","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60080064"}]}],"authkeywords":"Alex-Net | Artificial neural network | Autopilot | Deep learning convolution network | Drone | Machine learning | Quaternions | Stability of differential equations | Time delay | Vision-based navigation | Visual navigation","article-number":"2140","source-id":"21100830702","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85093942264"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85093942264?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85093942264&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85093942264&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S104784772030174X"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85093942264","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85093942264","eid":"2-s2.0-85093942264","dc:title":"Unit quaternion description of spatial rotations in 3D electron cryo-microscopy","dc:creator":"Hu M.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Structural Biology","prism:issn":"10478477","prism:eIssn":"10958657","prism:volume":"212","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 December 2020","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jsb.2020.107601","pii":"S104784772030174X","dc:description":"Electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) involves the estimation of spatial rotations, or saying orientations, of projection images or three-dimensional (3D) volumes. Euler angle system is widely used to describe spatial rotations in most cryoEM algorithms and software. In this review, we introduce unit quaternion as an alternate to Euler angles for describing spatial rotations, customize and develop corresponding tools for increasing demands of statistical analysis of spatial rotations in cryoEM. Some basic properties and definitions of quaternion are first recalled. Thereafter, distance and geodesic between rotations are introduced to aid comparisons and interpolations between rotations, which are prerequisites of statistics of rotations in 3D cryoEM. Furthermore, statistics of rotations are reviewed. Techniques potentially useful in cryoEM, such as calculations of the average rotation, generation of quasi-regular grids, sampling, inference with uniform distribution and angular central Gaussian (ACG) distribution, and estimation of rotation precision, are reviewed and developed. Finally, molecular symmetry presented in unit quaternion form is discussed. Unit quaternion system is shown as a convenient and comprehensive mathematical tool for cryoEM.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025278","afid":"60025278","affilname":"Tsinghua University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/123015358","afid":"123015358","affilname":"Beijing Frontier Research Center for Biological Structure","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/111605280","afid":"111605280","affilname":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Structural Biology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"33068699","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"re","subtypeDescription":"Review","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55972426700","authid":"55972426700","orcid":"0000-0003-3603-3966","authname":"Hu M.","surname":"Hu","given-name":"Mingxu","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025278"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025278"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"111605280"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219563714","authid":"57219563714","authname":"Zhang Q.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Qi","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025278"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57218299885","authid":"57218299885","authname":"Yang J.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Jing","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025278"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/37034553000","authid":"37034553000","orcid":"0000-0002-8451-9947","authname":"Li X.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Xueming","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025278"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025278"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"111605280"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"123015358"}]}],"article-number":"107601","source-id":"29659","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"11471178","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85091306471"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85091306471?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85091306471&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85091306471&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85091306471","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85091306471","eid":"2-s2.0-85091306471","dc:title":"A Novel Joint Angle Estimation Method for Serial Manipulator Using Micro-Electromechanical Systems Sensors","dc:creator":"Xu X.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","prism:issn":"02780046","prism:eIssn":"15579948","prism:volume":"67","prism:issueIdentifier":"12","prism:pageRange":"10610-10620","prism:coverDate":"2020-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2020","prism:doi":"10.1109/TIE.2019.2962442","dc:description":"This article focuses on the use of low-cost micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) magnetic, angular rate, and gravity (MARG) sensors in the field of estimating the joint angles of revolute serial manipulators. In particular, an easy-to-install joint angle estimation method, named the incremental decomposition method (IDM), is proposed. It allows the MEMS MARG sensors to be mounted in any attitude on any position of the manipulator's links, with at least one attitude measurement unit on the output side of each joint. The IDM is completely independent from the encoder-based joint angle estimator. Hence, it can work as an assistant fault-detection criterion for the economical robotic arms. A robotic arm with six degrees of freedom is used as the experimental setup. The IDM can estimate the manipulator's joint angles by fusing the attitude quaternion output by the MARG sensors. To validate the performances and limitations of this method, five experiments have been accomplished in this article. The experimental results are reported in order, in comparison with the high-resolution encoders.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031031","afid":"60031031","affilname":"Shandong University","affiliation-city":"Jinan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203034364","authid":"57203034364","orcid":"0000-0002-1953-2037","authname":"Xu X.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Xiaolong","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031031"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57868033200","authid":"57868033200","orcid":"0000-0001-8155-5697","authname":"Sun Y.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Yujie","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031031"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16314037100","authid":"16314037100","orcid":"0000-0001-9814-9521","authname":"Tian X.","surname":"Tian","given-name":"Xincheng","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031031"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36997629100","authid":"36997629100","orcid":"0000-0003-3308-870X","authname":"Zhou L.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Lelai","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031031"}]}],"authkeywords":"Calibration | manipulators | microelectro-mechanical devices | quaternions | rotation measurement","article-number":"8948354","source-id":"26053","fund-acr":"SDU","fund-no":"2016ZDJS02A07","fund-sponsor":"Shandong University","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85090270950"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85090270950?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85090270950&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85090270950&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85090270950","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85090270950","eid":"2-s2.0-85090270950","dc:title":"Orthogonal approach to independent component analysis using quaternionic factorization","dc:creator":"Borowicz A.","prism:publicationName":"Eurasip Journal on Advances in Signal Processing","prism:issn":"16876172","prism:eIssn":"16876180","prism:volume":"2020","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 December 2020","prism:doi":"10.1186/s13634-020-00697-0","dc:description":"Independent component analysis (ICA) is a popular technique for demixing multichannel data. The performance of a typical ICA algorithm strongly depends on the presence of additive noise, the actual distribution of source signals, and the estimated number of non-Gaussian components. Often, a linear mixing model is assumed and source signals are extracted by data whitening followed by a sequence of plane (Jacobi) rotations. In this article, we develop a novel algorithm, based on the quaternionic factorization of rotation matrices and the Newton-Raphson iterative scheme. Unlike conventional rotational techniques such as the JADE algorithm, our method exploits 4×4 rotation matrices and uses approximate negentropy as a contrast function. Consequently, the proposed method can be adjusted to a given data distribution (e.g., super-Gaussians) by selecting a suitable non-linear function that approximates the negentropy. Compared to the widely used, the symmetric FastICA algorithm, the proposed method does not require an orthogonalization step and is more accurate in the presence of multiple Gaussian sources.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002096","afid":"60002096","affilname":"Bialystok University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Bialystok","affiliation-country":"Poland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25645907600","authid":"25645907600","authname":"Borowicz A.","surname":"Borowicz","given-name":"Adam","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002096"}]}],"authkeywords":"BSS | ICA | Jacobi rotations | Negentropy | Quaternions","article-number":"39","source-id":"15300154801","fund-acr":"BUT","fund-no":"WZ/WI-IIT/4/2020","fund-sponsor":"Politechnika Bialostocka","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85078788927"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85078788927?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85078788927&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85078788927&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85078788927","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85078788927","eid":"2-s2.0-85078788927","dc:title":"User-Robot Interaction for Safe Navigation of a Quadrotor","dc:creator":"Sanchez L.F.","prism:publicationName":"Robotica","prism:issn":"02635747","prism:eIssn":"14698668","prism:volume":"38","prism:issueIdentifier":"12","prism:pageRange":"2189-2203","prism:coverDate":"2020-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 December 2020","prism:doi":"10.1017/S026357472000003X","pii":"S026357472000003X","dc:description":"This paper introduces an intuitive and safe command approach for a quadrotor, where inertial and muscular gestures are used for semi-autonomous flight.

Secondly, compliance with computational accuracy requirements with power limitations of the microcomputer base. In order to solve these problems, it is proposed to use the Method of trajectory control UAV in autonomous flight mode using neural network.

To solve the scientific and technical problem, for the first time it was proposed to use a unit for converting navigation data into a quaternion form to reduce the dimension of the input data, which in turn made it possible to increase the speed and accuracy of training the neural network without using the quantization process. For the first time, the MELM neural network algorithm was applied to solve autonomous navigation problems to reduce the deviation of UAVs from the target trajectory during the disappearance of GPS signals. It has been experimentally proved that the application of the developed technique has ensured a relatively slightest error in predicting the navigation parameters of the trajectory, which occurs in the event of the disappearance of signals of global satellite positioning systems.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60110449","afid":"60110449","affilname":"Kruty Heroes Military Institute of Telecommunications and Information Technologies","affiliation-city":"Kyiv","affiliation-country":"Ukraine"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57361395500","authid":"57361395500","authname":"Fesenko O.","surname":"Fesenko","given-name":"Oleksii","initials":"O.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60110449"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57210357169","authid":"57210357169","authname":"Bieliakov R.","surname":"Bieliakov","given-name":"Robert","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60110449"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57687233300","authid":"57687233300","authname":"Radzivilov H.","surname":"Radzivilov","given-name":"Hrygorii","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60110449"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57361565500","authid":"57361565500","authname":"Hulii V.","surname":"Hulii","given-name":"Volodymyr","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60110449"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221860471","authid":"57221860471","authname":"Kovalchuk O.","surname":"Kovalchuk","given-name":"Oleh","initials":"O.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60110449"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57361652000","authid":"57361652000","authname":"Korotchenko L.","surname":"Korotchenko","given-name":"Liudmyla","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60110449"}]}],"authkeywords":"Extreme learning machine | Flying Ad-Hoc Networks | Neural network | Unmanned aerial vehicles","source-id":"21101067501","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85098919479"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85098919479?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85098919479&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85098919479&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85098919479","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85098919479","eid":"2-s2.0-85098919479","dc:title":"A Contour Detection Method Based on Image Saliency","dc:creator":"Pan Y.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of 2020 IEEE 9th Data Driven Control and Learning Systems Conference, DDCLS 2020","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781728159225"}],"prism:pageRange":"42-46","prism:coverDate":"2020-11-20","prism:coverDisplayDate":"20 November 2020","prism:doi":"10.1109/DDCLS49620.2020.9275283","dc:description":"The object contour detection in natural scenes is an important research problem in computer vision. The difficulty is that the integrity of contour extracted is interfered with a large number of texture edges in the background seriously. In recent years, some researchers have introduced image contour detection method with biological visual features and achieved preferable results. Such as, based on the fact of visual outer region suppression, they can suppress a certain amount of texture edge while extracting the contour of the object, and obtain the proper contour edge. However, when this method is used for contour detection in some image which the texture is similar to the contour, the texture edge still cannot be removed well, and the result is unsatisfactory. In consideration of the merit and demerit of the feature suppressed method, we propose an improved algorithm for object contour detection in natural scene based on image saliency. Firstly, the initial contour is obtained by using the suppression effect of non-classical receptive field, and the saliency map is obtained by using the hyper-complex Fourier transform image saliency detection method, and then the initial contour and the saliency map are integrated into the final contour. Compared with the traditional contour detection method, the contour extraction algorithm based on image saliency can remove more background information and improve the accuracy and integrity of object contour extracted in natural scenes.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60088965","afid":"60088965","affilname":"Guangxi University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Liuzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216386451","authid":"57216386451","authname":"Pan Y.","surname":"Pan","given-name":"Yongcai","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60088965"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55358587500","authid":"55358587500","authname":"Zhang Y.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Yuwei","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60088965"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57212729948","authid":"57212729948","authname":"Liu Q.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Qingzheng","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60088965"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221356255","authid":"57221356255","authname":"Wu Z.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Zhaobin","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60088965"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221356214","authid":"57221356214","authname":"Hu W.","surname":"Hu","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60088965"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57217007946","authid":"57217007946","authname":"Wei Y.","surname":"Wei","given-name":"Yanxia","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60088965"}]}],"authkeywords":"Compound receptive field | Contour detection | Image saliency | Target identification","article-number":"9275283","source-id":"21101033279","fund-no":"IPICT-2016-07","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85101105575"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85101105575?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85101105575&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85101105575&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85101105575","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85101105575","eid":"2-s2.0-85101105575","dc:title":"DOA Estimation for Electromagnetic Vector-Sensor Array Based on Biquaternion","dc:creator":"Zhu Q.","prism:publicationName":"ICEICT 2020 - IEEE 3rd International Conference on Electronic Information and Communication Technology","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781728190457"}],"prism:pageRange":"509-513","prism:coverDate":"2020-11-13","prism:coverDisplayDate":"13 November 2020","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICEICT51264.2020.9334256","dc:description":"As a kind of hypercomplex number with strict orthogonality, quaternion can bring many benefits when applied to the signal processing for electromagnetic vector sensor array, but the quaternion model can deal two-component electromagnetic vector-sensors only.

The orthogonal information between electric dipoles is retained effectively, and the orthogonality between quaternions is more constrained than that between vectors, which can achieve better angle measurement performance.

However, the point correspondence-based algorithms require at least four feature points in the field of view. This paper considers the situation that there are only two feature points. Focusing on the attitude estimation, we propose to fuse a camera with low-cost inertial sensors based on a nonlinear complementary filter design. An implicit geometry measurement model is derived using two feature points in an image. This geometry measurement is fused with the angle rate measurement and vector measurement from inertial sensors using the proposed nonlinear complementary filter with only two parameters to be adjusted. The proposed nonlinear complementary filter is posed directly on the special orthogonal group SO(3). Based on the theory of nonlinear system stability analysis, the proposed filter ensures locally asymptotic stability. A quaternion-based discrete implementation of the filter is also given in this paper for computational efficiency. The proposed algorithm is validated using a smartphone with built-in inertial sensors and a rear camera. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms all the compared counterparts in estimated accuracy and provides competitive computational complexity.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025084","afid":"60025084","affilname":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"33255946","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189710832","authid":"57189710832","authname":"Zheng L.","surname":"Zheng","given-name":"Lingxiao","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8351858100","authid":"8351858100","authname":"Zhan X.","surname":"Zhan","given-name":"Xingqun","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192504994","authid":"57192504994","authname":"Zhang X.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude estimation | Camera | Consumer electronics | Inertial sensors | Nonlinear complementary filter","article-number":"6752","source-id":"130124","fund-no":"20181ACE50027","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85101474913"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85101474913?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85101474913&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85101474913&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85101474913","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85101474913","eid":"2-s2.0-85101474913","dc:title":"Deep Depth Estimation on 360° Images with a Double Quaternion Loss","dc:creator":"Feng B.Y.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - 2020 International Conference on 3D Vision, 3DV 2020","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781728181288"}],"prism:pageRange":"524-533","prism:coverDate":"2020-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2020","prism:doi":"10.1109/3DV50981.2020.00062","dc:description":"While 360° images are becoming ubiquitous due to popularity of panoramic content, they cannot directly work with most of the existing depth estimation techniques developed for perspective images.

We introduce double quaternion approximation to combine the loss of the joint estimation of depth and surface normal. Furthermore, we use the double quaternion formulation to also measure stereo consistency between the horizontally displaced depth maps, leading to a new loss function for training a depth estimation CNN.

In this paper, a method for measuring grinding surface roughness grinding based on the singular value entropy of the color image quaternion matrix is proposed. Color images captured at different levels of surface roughness are analyzed using a quaternion matrix, which is subjected to singular value decomposition from which a quaternion singular value entropy is derived as an index for evaluating roughness. Our experimental results show that this method for measuring grinding surface roughness based on quaternion singular value entropy is a more feasible roughness detection method than color difference indices because the singular value entropy is more strongly correlated with the actual roughness, with the monotonicity of the entropy decreasing more significantly as the roughness increases. Roughness prediction results obtained using a support vector machine also support the feasibility of measuring surface roughness based on the singular value entropy of the color image quaternion matrix, which can provide a reliable engineering application for the automatic measurement of surface roughness. Finally, the high degree of correspondence between the pure quaternion matrix and the image color matrix in the mathematical structure provides a broad mathematical space for the design and optimization of the color index.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006356","afid":"60006356","affilname":"Guilin University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Guilin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190381787","authid":"57190381787","orcid":"0000-0002-8983-9907","authname":"Huaian Y.","surname":"Huaian","given-name":"Yi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006356"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216371876","authid":"57216371876","orcid":"0000-0002-9696-6066","authname":"Xinjia Z.","surname":"Xinjia","given-name":"Zhao","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006356"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219133161","authid":"57219133161","authname":"Le T.","surname":"Le","given-name":"Tang","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006356"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222474353","authid":"57222474353","authname":"Yonglun C.","surname":"Yonglun","given-name":"Chen","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006356"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219133449","authid":"57219133449","authname":"Jie Y.","surname":"Jie","given-name":"Yang","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006356"}]}],"authkeywords":"color index | quaternion | singular value decomposition | surface roughness","article-number":"115006","source-id":"15526","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089566585"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089566585?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85089566585&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85089566585&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089566585","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85089566585","eid":"2-s2.0-85089566585","dc:title":"Fast and accurate online calibration of optical see-through head-mounted display for AR-based surgical navigation using Microsoft HoloLens","dc:creator":"Sun Q.","prism:publicationName":"International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery","prism:issn":"18616410","prism:eIssn":"18616429","prism:volume":"15","prism:issueIdentifier":"11","prism:pageRange":"1907-1919","prism:coverDate":"2020-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 November 2020","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11548-020-02246-4","dc:description":"Purpose:: The use of an optical see-through head-mounted display (OST-HMD) in augmented reality (AR) has significantly increased in recent years, but the alignment between the virtual scene and physical reality is still a challenge. A fast and accurate calibration method of OST-HMD is important for augmented reality in the medical field. Methods:: We proposed a fast online calibration procedure for OST-HMD with the aid of an optical tracking system. Two 3D datasets are collected in this procedure: the virtual points rendered in front of the observer’s eyes and the corresponding points in optical tracking space. The transformation between these two 3D coordinates is solved to build the connection between virtual and real space. An AR-based surgical navigation system is developed with the help of this procedure, which is used for experiment verification and clinical trial. Results:: Phantom experiment based on the 3D-printed skull is performed, and the average root-mean-square error of control points between rendered object and skull model is 1.30 ± 0.39 mm, and the time consumption of the calibration procedure can be less than 30 s. A clinical trial is also conducted to show the feasibility in real surgery theatre. Conclusions:: The proposed calibration method does not rely on the camera of the OST-HMD and is very easy to operate. Phantom experiment and clinical case demonstrated the feasibility of our AR-based surgical navigation system and indicated it has the potential in clinical application.","citedby-count":"34","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60082819","afid":"60082819","affilname":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025084","afid":"60025084","affilname":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000401","afid":"60000401","affilname":"Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster","affiliation-city":"Munster","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"pubmed-id":"32809184","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57218569445","authid":"57218569445","orcid":"0000-0003-0822-3017","authname":"Sun Q.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Qichang","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57218566091","authid":"57218566091","authname":"Mai Y.","surname":"Mai","given-name":"Yongfeng","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188853612","authid":"57188853612","authname":"Yang R.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Rong","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60082819"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8973090800","authid":"8973090800","authname":"Ji T.","surname":"Ji","given-name":"Tong","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60082819"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404628260","authid":"7404628260","authname":"Jiang X.","surname":"Jiang","given-name":"Xiaoyi","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000401"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55739098400","authid":"55739098400","orcid":"0000-0002-0298-4491","authname":"Chen X.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Xiaojun","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]}],"authkeywords":"Augmented reality | Calibration | Microsoft HoloLens | Surgical navigation","source-id":"4700152490","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"YG2019ZDA06","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85087813281"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85087813281?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85087813281&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85087813281&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0165168420302516"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85087813281","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85087813281","eid":"2-s2.0-85087813281","dc:title":"Unsupervised quaternion model for blind colour image quality assessment","dc:creator":"Wu L.","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing","prism:issn":"01651684","prism:volume":"176","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2020","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.sigpro.2020.107708","pii":"S0165168420302516","dc:description":"Without the limitations of labelled distorted images for training, the unsupervised blind colour image quality assessment (UBCIQA) model shows excellent generalization performance. However, existing UBCIQA methods fail to consider the correlation between different colour channels. This paper proposes an efficient UQBCIA algorithm. Placing R, G, and B channels of a colour image into the three imaginary parts of a quaternion, the proposed UQBCIA obtains the quaternion representation of a colour image, which allows UQBCIA to process the colour image as a whole while keeping its three colour channels dependent. The naturalness, structural and texture statistic features are then extracted to fit a multivariate Gaussian (MVG) model. The quality of the test colour image is calculated as the MVG distance between the fitted pristine images and the test image. The proposed method is evaluated from three aspects: (1) prediction accuracy, (2) computational complexity and (3) robustness on five colour databases. The results demonstrate that the proposed UQBCIA algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and classical supervised BIQA methods.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032356","afid":"60032356","affilname":"Hunan University","affiliation-city":"Changsha","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57210190869","authid":"57210190869","authname":"Wu L.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Leyuan","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7410269350","authid":"7410269350","authname":"Zhang X.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xiaogang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192534835","authid":"57192534835","authname":"Chen H.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Hua","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24175343600","authid":"24175343600","authname":"Zhou Y.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Yicong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]}],"authkeywords":"Colour image processing | Natural scene statistical | Quaternion representation | Unsupervised blind image quality assessment","article-number":"107708","source-id":"25548","fund-acr":"NKRDPC","fund-no":"2018YFB1305900","fund-sponsor":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85086820731"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85086820731?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85086820731&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85086820731&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0031320320303083"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85086820731","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85086820731","eid":"2-s2.0-85086820731","dc:title":"Low-rank quaternion tensor completion for recovering color videos and images","dc:creator":"Miao J.","prism:publicationName":"Pattern Recognition","prism:issn":"00313203","prism:volume":"107","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2020","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.patcog.2020.107505","pii":"S0031320320303083","dc:description":"Low-rank quaternion tensor completion method, a novel approach to recovery color videos and images, is proposed in this paper. We respectively reconstruct a color image and a color video as a quaternion matrix (second-order tensor) and a third-order quaternion tensor by encoding the red, green, and blue channel pixel values on the three imaginary parts of a quaternion. Different from some traditional models which treat color pixel as a scalar and represent color channels separately, whereas, during the quaternion-based reconstruction, it is significant that the inherent color structures of color images and color videos can be completely preserved. Under the definition of Tucker rank, the global low-rank prior to quaternion tensor is encoded as the nuclear norm of unfolding quaternion matrices. Then, by applying the ADMM framework, we provide the tensor completion algorithm for any order ( ≥ 2) quaternion tensors, which theoretically can be well used to recover missing entries of any multidimensional data with color structures. Simulation results for color videos and color images recovery show the superior performance and efficiency of the proposed method over some state-of-the-art existing ones.","citedby-count":"27","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60122420","afid":"60122420","affilname":"Shandong University of Finance and Economics","affiliation-city":"Jinan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201452670","authid":"57201452670","orcid":"0000-0001-5663-8749","authname":"Miao J.","surname":"Miao","given-name":"Jifei","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003837546","authid":"7003837546","orcid":"0000-0003-1924-9087","authname":"Kou K.I.","surname":"Kou","given-name":"Kit Ian","initials":"K.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57218182246","authid":"57218182246","authname":"Liu W.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Wankai","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122420"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color images | Color videos | Low-rank | Quaternion | Tensor completion","article-number":"107505","source-id":"24823","fund-acr":"STDF","fund-no":"FDCT/085/2018/A2","fund-sponsor":"Science and Technology Development Fund","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}}]}}
