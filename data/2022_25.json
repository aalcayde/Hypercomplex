Although they present several advantages in terms of cost and form factor, they are prone to various disturbances such as noise, biases, and random walk that degrade their orientation estimation. The task of an orientation filter is to compute an optimal solution for the attitude state, consisting of roll, pitch and yaw, through the fusion of angular rate, accelerometer, and magnetometer measurements, regardless of the underlying environmental constraints. The aim of this paper is threefold: first, it serves researchers and practitioners in the signal processing community seeking the most appropriate attitude estimators that fulfills their needs, shedding light on the drawbacks and the advantages of a wide variety of designs. Second, it serves as a survey and tutorial for existing estimator designs in the literature, assessing their design aspects and components, and dissecting their hidden details for the benefit of researchers. Third, a comprehensive list of algorithms is discussed for a fully functional inertial navigation system, starting from the navigation equations and ending with the filter equations, keeping in mind their suitability for power-limited embedded processors. The source code of all algorithms is published, with the aim of it being an out-of-box solution for researchers in the field. The reader will take away the following concepts from this article: understand the key concepts of an inertial navigation system; be able to implement and test a complete stand alone solution; be able to evaluate and understand different algorithms; understand the trade-offs between different filter architectures and techniques; and understand efficient embedded processing techniques, trends and opportunities.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60068761","afid":"60068761","affilname":"American University of Beirut","affiliation-city":"Beirut","affiliation-country":"Lebanon"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206243784","authid":"57206243784","authname":"Al-Jlailaty H.","surname":"Al-Jlailaty","given-name":"Hussein","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60068761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35810772500","authid":"35810772500","orcid":"0000-0002-8316-1330","authname":"Mansour M.M.","surname":"Mansour","given-name":"Mohammad M.","initials":"M.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60068761"}]}],"authkeywords":"Coning and sculling compensation | Embedded processors | Kalman filter | Measurement model | Navigation equations | Quaternions | Rotation matrix | System-error dynamics | Tilt errors","source-id":"11400153333","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85143068469"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85143068469?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85143068469&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85143068469&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85143068469","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85143068469","eid":"2-s2.0-85143068469","dc:title":"Gaussian process regression-based quaternion unscented Kalman robust filter for integrated SINS/GNSS","dc:creator":"Lyu X.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","prism:issn":"16711793","prism:volume":"33","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"1079-1088","prism:coverDate":"2022-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2022","prism:doi":"10.23919/JSEE.2022.000105","dc:description":"High-precision filtering estimation is one of the key techniques for strapdown inertial navigation system/global navigation satellite system (SINS/GNSS) integrated navigation system, and its estimation plays an important role in the performance evaluation of the navigation system. Traditional filter estimation methods usually assume that the measurement noise conforms to the Gaussian distribution, without considering the influence of the pollution introduced by the GNSS signal, which is susceptible to external interference. To address this problem, a high-precision filter estimation method using Gaussian process regression (GPR) is proposed to enhance the prediction and estimation capability of the unscented quaternion estimator (USQUE) to improve the navigation accuracy. Based on the advantage of the GPR machine learning function, the estimation performance of the sliding window for model training is measured. This method estimates the output of the observation information source through the measurement window and realizes the robust measurement update of the filter. The combination of GPR and the USQUE algorithm establishes a robust mechanism framework, which enhances the robustness and stability of traditional methods. The results of the trajectory simulation experiment and SINS/GNSS car-mounted tests indicate that the strategy has strong robustness and high estimation accuracy, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60069736","afid":"60069736","affilname":"Naval University of Engineering","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002018","afid":"60002018","affilname":"Liaoning University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Jinzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114674688","afid":"114674688","affilname":"Beijing Huahang Radio Measurement Research Institute","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57217675858","authid":"57217675858","authname":"Lyu X.","surname":"Lyu","given-name":"Xu","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069736"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"114674688"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15077775500","authid":"15077775500","authname":"Hu B.","surname":"Hu","given-name":"Baiqing","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069736"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35228973100","authid":"35228973100","authname":"Dai Y.","surname":"Dai","given-name":"Yongbin","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002018"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57987639600","authid":"57987639600","authname":"Sun M.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Mingfang","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192566956","authid":"57192566956","authname":"Liu Y.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Yi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069736"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203552597","authid":"57203552597","authname":"Gao D.","surname":"Gao","given-name":"Duanyang","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069736"}]}],"authkeywords":"Gaussian process regression (GPR) | integrated navigation | Kalman filter | quaternion | robustness","source-id":"58655","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"425317829","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85137044448"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85137044448?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85137044448&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85137044448&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85137044448","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85137044448","eid":"2-s2.0-85137044448","dc:title":"Efficient Color Image Segmentation via Quaternion-based L<inf>1</inf>/ L<inf>2</inf> Regularization","dc:creator":"Wu T.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Scientific Computing","prism:issn":"08857474","prism:eIssn":"15737691","prism:volume":"93","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"October 2022","prism:doi":"10.1007/s10915-022-01970-0","dc:description":"Color image segmentation is a key technology in image processing. In this paper, a two-stage image segmentation method is proposed that is based on the nonconvex L1/ L2 approximation of the Mumford-Shah (MS) model. Wherein, the nonconvex regularization term L1/ L2 on the gradient can approximate the Hausdorff measure and extract more boundary information. The first stage is to solve the nonconvex variant of the MS model and to obtain the smoothed image u. In our framework, we utilize the semi-proximal alternating direction method of multipliers (sPADMM) to sufficiently solve the proposed model. The second stage is segmenting the smoothed u into different phases with thresholds determined by the threshold clustering method. To better deal with the inherent color structures within different channels, we also apply the quaternion representation of the color image. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate clearly that our method is better than some state-of-the-art color image segmentation methods.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60069734","afid":"60069734","affilname":"Logistical Engineering University China","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009400","afid":"60009400","affilname":"Nanjing University of Post and TeleCommunications","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002798","afid":"60002798","affilname":"Chinese University of Hong Kong","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57129572900","authid":"57129572900","authname":"Wu T.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Tingting","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009400"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57682545000","authid":"57682545000","authname":"Mao Z.","surname":"Mao","given-name":"Zhihui","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009400"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57867895800","authid":"57867895800","authname":"Li Z.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Zeyu","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002798"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402981495","authid":"7402981495","authname":"Zeng Y.","surname":"Zeng","given-name":"Yonghua","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069734"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25423412800","authid":"25423412800","orcid":"0000-0002-0688-202X","authname":"Zeng T.","surname":"Zeng","given-name":"Tieyong","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002798"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image segmentation | Convergence analysis | L / L  regularization 1 2 | Quaternion | sPADMM","article-number":"9","source-id":"23490","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"11501301","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85134817722"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85134817722?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85134817722&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85134817722&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0893608022002611"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85134817722","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85134817722","eid":"2-s2.0-85134817722","dc:title":"QMEDNet: A quaternion-based multi-order differential encoder–decoder model for 3D human motion prediction","dc:creator":"Cao W.","prism:publicationName":"Neural Networks","prism:issn":"08936080","prism:eIssn":"18792782","prism:volume":"154","prism:pageRange":"141-151","prism:coverDate":"2022-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"October 2022","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.neunet.2022.07.005","pii":"S0893608022002611","dc:description":"In order to deal with the sequence information in the task of 3D human motion prediction effectively, many previous methods seek to predict the motion state of the next moment using the traditional recurrent neural network in Euclidean space. However human motion representation in Euclidean space has high distortion and shows a weak semantic expression when using deep learning models. In this work, we try to process human motion by mapping Euclidean space into a Hypercomplex vector space. We propose a novel model based on quaternion to predict the three-dimensional motion of a human body. The core idea of this study is to use the fusion information to understand and process the human motion state in quaternion space. The multi-order differential information is fused both in the encoder and decoder of feature extraction and mapped to the quaternion space, respectively. The encoder takes graph convolution as the basic unit and the decoder adopts gated recurrent units. Numerous experiments have been carried out to prove that the multi-order information in quaternion space can help build a more reasonable description for 3D human motion. The performance of the proposed QMEDNet is superior to most of the advanced short and long-term motion prediction methods in both public datasets, Human 3.6M and CMU Mocap.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60271961","afid":"60271961","affilname":"Peng Cheng Laboratory","affiliation-city":"Shenzhen","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000937","afid":"60000937","affilname":"Shenzhen University","affiliation-city":"Shenzhen","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"35882082","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402082924","authid":"7402082924","orcid":"0000-0002-8174-6167","authname":"Cao W.","surname":"Cao","given-name":"Wenming","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000937"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60271961"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222720088","authid":"57222720088","authname":"Li S.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Shuangshuang","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000937"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205428209","authid":"57205428209","orcid":"0000-0001-7939-1494","authname":"Zhong J.","surname":"Zhong","given-name":"Jianqi","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000937"}]}],"authkeywords":"Graph neural networks | Human motion predicting | Quaternion","source-id":"24804","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"JCYJ20190808160815125","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85133065931"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85133065931?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85133065931&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85133065931&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85133065931","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85133065931","eid":"2-s2.0-85133065931","dc:title":"Spaceborne pose determination based on image to 3D digital surface model matching","dc:creator":"Chang X.","prism:publicationName":"IET Image Processing","prism:issn":"17519659","prism:eIssn":"17519667","prism:volume":"16","prism:issueIdentifier":"12","prism:pageRange":"3314-3324","prism:coverDate":"2022-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"16 October 2022","prism:doi":"10.1049/ipr2.12566","dc:description":"Developing an accurate onboard-camera pose estimation is one major challenge of satellite systems, and the attempt of improving remote sensing camera pose accuracy never ceases. The camera pose can be recovered by aligning a captured 2D image and a 3D digital surface model of the corresponding scene. In this paper, a novel camera pose estimation method from captured images with the over known real scene 3D products is proposed to enhance remote sensing camera attitude accuracy. The purpose of this estimation is to determine the pose of a camera purely from an image based on a known 3D model, where 3D products of very high spatial resolution are projected onto image space by virtual camera system with error-contained initial exterior orientation parameters, and whether the pose of the camera can be determined precisely depends on the 2D–3D registration result. The process consists of two steps: (1) feature extraction and (2) similarity measure and registration. Furthermore, the proposed method revises the rotation matrix and translation vector by utilizing formulation based on quaternion representation of rotation, respectively. We evaluate our method on challenging simulation data and results show that acceptable accuracy of camera pose can be achieved.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009806","afid":"60009806","affilname":"Lanzhou Jiaotong University","affiliation-city":"Lanzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57207808469","authid":"57207808469","orcid":"0000-0002-8333-2400","authname":"Chang X.","surname":"Chang","given-name":"Xing","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009806"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56131198100","authid":"56131198100","authname":"Yang G.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Guiqin","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009806"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57769596900","authid":"57769596900","authname":"Chen J.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Jiayu","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009806"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7501858561","authid":"7501858561","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiaopeng","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009806"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23008715300","authid":"23008715300","authname":"Jiang Z.","surname":"Jiang","given-name":"Zhanjun","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009806"}]}],"source-id":"5400152646","fund-acr":"NNSFC, NNSF, NSF, NSFC","fund-no":"61761027","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85132517294"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85132517294?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85132517294&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85132517294&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85132517294","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85132517294","eid":"2-s2.0-85132517294","dc:title":"Pose and Motion Estimation of Free-Flying Objects: Aerodynamics, Constrained Filtering, and Graph-Based Feature Tracking","dc:creator":"Gardner M.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","prism:issn":"15523098","prism:eIssn":"19410468","prism:volume":"38","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"3187-3202","prism:coverDate":"2022-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/TRO.2022.3165367","dc:description":"In this article, we investigate the problem of dynamically estimating the instantaneous position, orientation, velocity, and angular velocity of an arbitrarily shaped object during its free flight based on image frames taken simultaneously by two high-speed cameras. Aerodynamic effects, including drag, lift, and Magnus forces, are modeled to describe the object's flight. Observables are derived from combining dynamics with a camera projection model assuming two-view geometry, via the use of multiple quaternions. The state of the composed system can then be estimated via constrained Kalman filtering, to which a solution is presented for the case of multiple quadratic constraints. To keep track of appearing and disappearing visual features during flight, the estimation algorithm employs a graph matching-based technique to maintain a set of evolving hypotheses through evaluation, pruning, and addition. Experiments conducted over various objects have either provided validation against motions independently estimated using multiple accelerometers, or formed verification by matching flight images against projections based on the state estimates.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004354","afid":"60004354","affilname":"Iowa State University","affiliation-city":"Ames","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/106748161","afid":"106748161","affilname":"Boston Dynamics","affiliation-city":"Waltham","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192433795","authid":"57192433795","orcid":"0000-0002-1843-5518","authname":"Gardner M.","surname":"Gardner","given-name":"Matthew","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"106748161"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401503827","authid":"7401503827","orcid":"0000-0002-0384-6058","authname":"Jia Y.B.","surname":"Jia","given-name":"Yan Bin","initials":"Y.B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004354"}]}],"authkeywords":"Aerodynamics | constrained optimization | estimation | feature tracking | image graph | Kalman filtering","source-id":"95101","fund-acr":"NSF","fund-no":"IIS-1421034","fund-sponsor":"National Science Foundation","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85122296362"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85122296362?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85122296362&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85122296362&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85122296362","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85122296362","eid":"2-s2.0-85122296362","dc:title":"Skin lesion image classification using sparse representation in quaternion wavelet domain","dc:creator":"Ngo L.H.","prism:publicationName":"Signal, Image and Video Processing","prism:issn":"18631703","prism:eIssn":"18631711","prism:volume":"16","prism:issueIdentifier":"7","prism:pageRange":"1721-1729","prism:coverDate":"2022-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"October 2022","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11760-021-02112-z","dc:description":"Automated melanoma classification remains a challenging task because skin lesion images are prone to low contrast and many kinds of artifacts.

Using the public skin lesion image datasets ISIC2017 and ISIC2019, we experimentally validated that creating dictionary with quaternions of low-frequency wavelet sub-band leads to the most accurate classification of skin lesions to melanoma or benign.

The corresponding multivariate methods, multivariate multiscale sample entropy (MMSE) and multivariate multiscale fuzzy entropy (MMFE), were developed to explore the structural richness within signals at high scales. However, the requirement of high scale limits the selection of embedding dimension and thus, the performance is unavoidably restricted by the trade-off between the data size and the required high scale. More importantly, the scale of interest in different situations is varying, yet little is known about the optimal setting of the scale range in MMSE and MMFE. To this end, we extend the univariate cosine similarity entropy (CSE) method to the multivariate case, and show that the resulting multivariate multiscale cosine similarity entropy (MMCSE) is capable of quantifying structural complexity through the degree of self-correlation within signals. The proposed approach relaxes the prohibitive constraints between the embedding dimension and data length, and aims to quantify the structural complexity based on the degree of self-correlation at low scales. The proposed MMCSE is applied to the examination of the complex and quaternion circularity properties of signals with varying correlation behaviors, and simulations show the MMCSE outperforming the standard methods, MMSE and MMFE.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015150","afid":"60015150","affilname":"Imperial College London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000316","afid":"60000316","affilname":"Srinakharinwirot University","affiliation-city":"Bangkok","affiliation-country":"Thailand"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57214085773","authid":"57214085773","orcid":"0000-0002-1615-8174","authname":"Xiao H.","surname":"Xiao","given-name":"Hongjian","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16318476800","authid":"16318476800","orcid":"0000-0002-4270-7683","authname":"Chanwimalueang T.","surname":"Chanwimalueang","given-name":"Theerasak","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000316"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006513328","authid":"7006513328","orcid":"0000-0001-8432-3963","authname":"Mandic D.P.","surname":"Mandic","given-name":"Danilo P.","initials":"D.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]}],"authkeywords":"angular distance | complex circularity | cosine similarity entropy | detection of circularity | multi-channel system | multivariate entropy | quaternion circularity","article-number":"1287","source-id":"13715","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85135519271"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85135519271?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85135519271&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85135519271&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S105120042200272X"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85135519271","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85135519271","eid":"2-s2.0-85135519271","dc:title":"Adaptive quaternion multivariate local characteristic-scale decomposition and its application to gear fault diagnosis","dc:creator":"Zhou J.","prism:publicationName":"Digital Signal Processing: A Review Journal","prism:issn":"10512004","prism:volume":"129","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"September 2022","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.dsp.2022.103655","pii":"S105120042200272X","dc:description":"Local characteristic-scale decomposition (LCD) has been widely applied in the field of gear fault diagnosis. However, LCD is only suitable for processing single channel signals and has poor noise robustness. Gear fault information collected by single channel of the sensor is not sufficient when the background noise is severe, based on which, a novel adaptive multivariate signal noise reduction method, quaternion singular value decomposition fault information spectrum (QSVDFIS), is defined in this paper. Based on QSVDFIS, a new multivariate signal decomposition method, adaptive quaternion multivariate local characteristic-scale decomposition (AQMLCD), is proposed in this paper. AQMLCD can adaptively reduce the noise of multivariate signal components, effectively fuse the fault information of each channel. Compared with multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD), the noise robustness of AQMLCD is significantly improved, while the computation efficiency of AQMLCD is similar to that of MEMD. AQMLCD is applied to gear fault simulation and experimental signals, and the results illustrate the superiority of AQMLCD method.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032356","afid":"60032356","affilname":"Hunan University","affiliation-city":"Changsha","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/123165543","afid":"123165543","affilname":"National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Helicopter Transmission","affiliation-city":"Zhuzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/121984863","afid":"121984863","affilname":"AECC Key Laboratory of Aero-engine Vibration Technology","affiliation-city":"Zhuzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57756924900","authid":"57756924900","authname":"Zhou J.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Jie","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8849330300","authid":"8849330300","authname":"Cheng J.","surname":"Cheng","given-name":"Junsheng","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57396328100","authid":"57396328100","authname":"Wu X.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Xiaowei","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"123165543"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"121984863"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206679003","authid":"57206679003","authname":"Wang J.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Jian","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"121984863"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7409385350","authid":"7409385350","authname":"Yang Y.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Yu","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive quaternion multivariate local characteristic-scale decomposition | Fault diagnosis | Gear | Quaternion singular value decomposition fault information spectrum","article-number":"103655","source-id":"24306","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"51875183","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85134887089"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85134887089?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85134887089&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85134887089&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0020025522007447"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85134887089","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85134887089","eid":"2-s2.0-85134887089","dc:title":"Superpixel-guided locality quaternion representation for color face hallucination","dc:creator":"Liu L.","prism:publicationName":"Information Sciences","prism:issn":"00200255","prism:volume":"609","prism:pageRange":"565-577","prism:coverDate":"2022-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"September 2022","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.ins.2022.07.057","pii":"S0020025522007447","dc:description":"Recently, the learning based methods have been well exploited to hallucinate grayscale face images. When facing color images, however, the previous approaches either suffering from the non-flexibility for arbitrary pattern shapes or ignoring the inherent color information. To address these concerns, in this paper we propose a new learning model named as Superpixel-guided Locality Quaternion Representation (SLQR) for color face hallucination. Rather than handling squared patches with fixed size, the proposed method handles superpixels with adaptive shapes segmented from face images according to semantic contents, which can well preserve the face spatial features. Moreover, the superpixels are mapped into quaternion space to exploit the inherent spectral information for color image reconstruction. In addition, considering that images are inevitably corrupted by noise in practice, we extend the SLQR to the robust version (W-SLQR) by introducing a proper reweighting strategy into the objective function to suppress noise. Compared to some state-of-the-art methods, various experiments have been conducted to verify the superiority of our proposed methods in hallucinating clean and noisy face images.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032356","afid":"60032356","affilname":"Hunan University","affiliation-city":"Changsha","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024542","afid":"60024542","affilname":"South China University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008919","afid":"60008919","affilname":"Guilin University of Electronic Technology","affiliation-city":"Guilin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55970181500","authid":"55970181500","authname":"Liu L.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Licheng","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57674450100","authid":"57674450100","authname":"Tang X.","surname":"Tang","given-name":"Xiaoqin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57217604244","authid":"57217604244","authname":"Chen C.L.P.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"C.

The originality is reflected in the integration of quaternion algebra with a cascaded encryption structure. First, image RGB channels are constituted into three imaginary parts of a quaternion matrix. A cascaded encryption structure is constructed to cooperate with the vortex phase mask, which is easy to transmit and saves storage. Then, a quaternion gyrator transform is conducted, after which the phase is extracted to serve as the decryption key while the amplitude is used as the real part of the following quaternion matrix. Finally, the amplitude of the last gyrator transform is scrambled to obtain the ciphertext. All phase matrices are further modulated by a secondary image phase mask for additional security.

However, most existing calibration methods focus on calibrating the underwater camera in a single scenario [e.g., air-glass-water], which can not well formulate the geometry constraint and further result in the complex calibration process. Moreover, the calibration precision of these methods is low, since multilayer transparent refractions with unknown layer orientation and distance make the task more difficult than that in air. To address these challenges, we develop a novel and efficient medium-driven method for underwater camera calibration (MedUCC), which can calibrate the underwater camera parameters, including the orientation and position of the transparent glass accurately. Our key idea of this article is to leverage the light-path changes formed by medium refractions between different media to acquire calibration data, which can better formulate the geometry constraint, and estimate the initial value of the underwater camera parameters. To improve the calibration accuracy of the underwater camera system, a quaternion-based solution is developed to refine the underwater camera parameters. To the end, we evaluate the calibration performance on an underwater camera system. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our proposed method can obtain a better performance in comparison to the existing works. We also validate our proposed MedUCC method on our designed 3-D scanner prototype, which illustrates the superiority of our proposed calibration method.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027363","afid":"60027363","affilname":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021474","afid":"60021474","affilname":"Shenyang Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Shenyang","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019499","afid":"60019499","affilname":"Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009400","afid":"60009400","affilname":"Nanjing University of Post and TeleCommunications","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192166387","authid":"57192166387","orcid":"0000-0003-1169-4928","authname":"Gu C.","surname":"Gu","given-name":"Changjun","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021474"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019499"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36852090700","authid":"36852090700","orcid":"0000-0002-5102-0189","authname":"Cong Y.","surname":"Cong","given-name":"Yang","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021474"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019499"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193241838","authid":"57193241838","orcid":"0000-0003-1111-6909","authname":"Sun G.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Gan","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021474"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019499"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57392743600","authid":"57392743600","authname":"Gao Y.","surname":"Gao","given-name":"Yajun","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021474"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019499"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221265846","authid":"57221265846","authname":"Tang X.","surname":"Tang","given-name":"Xu","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021474"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019499"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57198706057","authid":"57198706057","orcid":"0000-0002-9800-7387","authname":"Zhang T.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Tao","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021474"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019499"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35483667900","authid":"35483667900","orcid":"0000-0002-1627-9726","authname":"Fan B.","surname":"Fan","given-name":"Baojie","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009400"}]}],"authkeywords":"Pose estimation | refractive 3-D reconstruction | underwater camera calibration | underwater robot | underwater vision","source-id":"21100262320","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"62003336","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85137361030"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85137361030?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85137361030&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85137361030&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85137361030","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85137361030","eid":"2-s2.0-85137361030","dc:title":"QuatJND: A Robust Quaternion JND Model for Color Image Watermarking","dc:creator":"Wan W.","prism:publicationName":"Entropy","prism:eIssn":"10994300","prism:volume":"24","prism:issueIdentifier":"8","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"August 2022","prism:doi":"10.3390/e24081051","dc:description":"Robust quantization watermarking with perceptual JND model has made a great success for image copyright protection. Generally, either restores each color channel separately or processes the vector representation from three color channels with the traditional monochromatic model. And it cannot make full use of the high correlation among RGB channels. In this paper, we proposed a robust quaternion JND Model for color image watermarking (QuatJND). In contrast to the existing perceptual JND models, the advantage of QuatJND is that it can integrate quaternion representation domain and colorfulness simultaneously, and QuatJND incorporates the pattern guided contrast masking effect in quaternion domain. On the other hand, in order to efficiently utilize the color information, we further develop a robust quantization watermarking framework using the color properties of the quaternion DCT coefficients in QuatJND. And the quantization steps of each quaternion DCT block in the scheme are optimal. Experimental results show that our method has a good performance in term of robustness with better visual quality.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002210","afid":"60002210","affilname":"Shandong Normal University","affiliation-city":"Jinan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35328241700","authid":"35328241700","orcid":"0000-0003-1447-0524","authname":"Wan W.","surname":"Wan","given-name":"Wenbo","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002210"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57877645900","authid":"57877645900","authname":"Li W.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Wenqing","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002210"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57877646000","authid":"57877646000","authname":"Liu W.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Wenxiu","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002210"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57876694600","authid":"57876694600","authname":"Diao Z.","surname":"Diao","given-name":"Zihan","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002210"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57196247401","authid":"57196247401","authname":"Zhan Y.","surname":"Zhan","given-name":"Yantong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002210"}]}],"authkeywords":"colorfulness | contrast masking | quaternion JND | robustness | watermarking","article-number":"1051","source-id":"13715","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61601268","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85131408227"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85131408227?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85131408227&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85131408227&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0952197622001749"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85131408227","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85131408227","eid":"2-s2.0-85131408227","dc:title":"Light-field image watermarking based on geranion polar harmonic Fourier moments","dc:creator":"Wang C.","prism:publicationName":"Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","prism:issn":"09521976","prism:volume":"113","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"August 2022","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.engappai.2022.104970","pii":"S0952197622001749","dc:description":"Light-field images provide a spatial and angular description of the light, and they can capture rich visual information in the natural world.

In this work, relying on geranion theory and polar harmonic Fourier moments (PHFMs), geranion polar harmonic Fourier moments (GPHFMs) are constructed and utilized for light-field image watermarking. The geranion represents a hypercomplex number containing one real part and thirty-one imaginary parts, and the imaginary parts of geranion can be used to encode multiple image color components while maintaining the correlation between each component. GPHFMs are stable image features, with good image reconstruction ability and stability. Essentially, the light-field image watermarking based on GPHFMs offers good imperceptibility and robustness, can resist various attacks, and effectively solves the problem of current watermarking schemes related to their inability of resisting geometric attacks. Furthermore, it is verified through experiments that the proposed scheme is more robust than the previously reported schemes.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031419","afid":"60031419","affilname":"Ningbo University","affiliation-city":"Ningbo","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011592","afid":"60011592","affilname":"Qilu University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Jinan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55318994100","authid":"55318994100","authname":"Wang C.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Chunpeng","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011592"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57729718600","authid":"57729718600","orcid":"0000-0002-0567-9388","authname":"Zhang Q.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Qinghua","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011592"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204589541","authid":"57204589541","authname":"Ma B.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Bin","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011592"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188991071","authid":"57188991071","authname":"Xia Z.","surname":"Xia","given-name":"Zhiqiu","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011592"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56290438800","authid":"56290438800","authname":"Li J.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Jian","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011592"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54397301800","authid":"54397301800","orcid":"0000-0003-1762-148X","authname":"Luo T.","surname":"Luo","given-name":"Ting","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031419"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204177824","authid":"57204177824","authname":"Li Q.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Qi","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011592"}]}],"authkeywords":"Geranions | Image reconstruction | Light-field images | Polar harmonic Fourier moments | Watermarking","article-number":"104970","source-id":"24182","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"SD2019-161","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85129543278"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85129543278?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85129543278&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85129543278&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0957417422005243"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85129543278","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85129543278","eid":"2-s2.0-85129543278","dc:title":"Orthogonal invariant Lagrange-Fourier moments for image recognition","dc:creator":"Hjouji A.","prism:publicationName":"Expert Systems with Applications","prism:issn":"09574174","prism:volume":"199","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 August 2022","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117126","pii":"S0957417422005243","dc:description":"The orthogonal moments have recently achieved outstanding predictive performance, and become an indispensable tool in a wide range of pattern recognition applications, including the image classification and object detection.

These orthogonal moments are presented in polar coordinates. We present a set of numerical experiments in the field of classification and pattern recognition to evaluate the performance of the proposed invariant moments.

Unlike grayscale image, each color image has three channels in the RGB color space. Due to the inner-relationship within the three channels, color image restoration is usually much more difficult than its grayscale counterpart. Indeed, new problems such as color artifacts could emerge when the grayscale image processing methods are extended to color images directly. Note that one of the most effective gray image restoration methods is the weighted nuclear norm minimization (WNNM) approach. However, when applied to color images, the results of WNNM are usually not as promising as that of grayscale images. In order to solve this problem, in this paper, we propose to restore color images with the quaternion-based WNNM method (QWNNM) since the structure of color channels can be well preserved with quaternion representation. The proposed model can be solved efficiently by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The theoretical analysis of the optimal solution is also presented. Numerical experiments are carefully conducted with different kinds of degradation to illustrate the superior performance of our proposed QWNNM over the state-of-the-art methods, including a celebrated deep learning approach, in both visual quality and numerical results.","citedby-count":"14","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021200","afid":"60021200","affilname":"East China Normal University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009400","afid":"60009400","affilname":"Nanjing University of Post and TeleCommunications","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002798","afid":"60002798","affilname":"Chinese University of Hong Kong","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57238469700","authid":"57238469700","orcid":"0000-0002-9347-3151","authname":"Huang C.","surname":"Huang","given-name":"Chaoyan","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009400"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57885035200","authid":"57885035200","authname":"Li Z.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Zhi","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021200"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57552021100","authid":"57552021100","authname":"Liu Y.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Yubing","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009400"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57129572900","authid":"57129572900","orcid":"0000-0002-9880-8619","authname":"Wu T.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Tingting","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009400"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25423412800","authid":"25423412800","orcid":"0000-0002-0688-202X","authname":"Zeng T.","surname":"Zeng","given-name":"Tieyong","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002798"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image restoration | Low-rank matrix analysis | Quaternion representation | Variational method | Weighted nuclear norm","article-number":"108665","source-id":"24823","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"11501301","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85120875451"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85120875451?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85120875451&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85120875451&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85120875451","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85120875451","eid":"2-s2.0-85120875451","dc:title":"Quaternion Capsule Neural Network With Region Attention for Facial Expression Recognition in Color Images","dc:creator":"Zhou Y.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence","prism:eIssn":"2471285X","prism:volume":"6","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"893-912","prism:coverDate":"2022-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 August 2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/TETCI.2021.3120513","dc:description":"Facial expression recognition (FER) is an essential subject of computer vision and human-computer interaction. It has been reported that many factors are closely related to the FER performance such as the pose, facial muscle variations, and the ignored color information in facial images. In this study, we propose a quaternion capsule neural network (Q-CapsNet) with region attention mechanism for FER in color images. The proposed Q-CapsNet is an end-to-end deep learning framework, which adopts the concept of quaternion theory to the Capsule Neural Network and further uses an attention mechanism to focus on the facial region of interests (ROIs). The Q-CapsNet addresses the FER problems in the following aspects. First, the internal dependencies between color channels are captured by the quaternion technique, which is of great importance in color image processing. Second, the Q-CapsNet could disentangle latent geometry information from facial images by quaternion capsules and quaternion routing algorithm. Third, inspired by the fact that facial expressions are mainly determined by several vital facial regions, the region attention mechanism is introduced to extract emotional features from the ROIs of the face. The proposed Q-CapsNet is evaluated on four public color FER datasets including MMI, Oulu-CASIA, RAF-DB, and SFEW. The comprehensive experiments and visualization results demonstrate that the proposed network outperforms comparative models and the state-of-the-art FER methods.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025761","afid":"60025761","affilname":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57071857400","authid":"57071857400","orcid":"0000-0003-1937-5331","authname":"Zhou Y.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Yu","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15922652500","authid":"15922652500","orcid":"0000-0002-8634-7026","authname":"Jin L.","surname":"Jin","given-name":"Lianghai","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15060448300","authid":"15060448300","authname":"Ma G.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Guangzhi","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55706250100","authid":"55706250100","authname":"Xu X.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Xiangyang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]}],"authkeywords":"Capsule neural network | color facial expression recognition | quaternion | region attention mechanism","source-id":"21100976672","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61370181","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85114745405"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85114745405?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85114745405&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85114745405&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85114745405","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85114745405","eid":"2-s2.0-85114745405","dc:title":"Robust Hybrid Attitude and Gyro-Bias Observer on Quaternions","dc:creator":"Tong X.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","prism:issn":"02780046","prism:eIssn":"15579948","prism:volume":"69","prism:issueIdentifier":"8","prism:pageRange":"8545-8553","prism:coverDate":"2022-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 August 2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/TIE.2021.3108713","dc:description":"Existing research has reported that the topological obstructions pose inherent difficulty to attitude estimation.

Second, to address these limitations, we develop a generic quaternion-based hybrid scheme with guaranteed GAS and robustness to measurement noises, in the sense that knowledge of a specific potential function suffices to design an attitude and gyro-bias observer with desired properties.

attitude tracking gimbal was designed.Firstly, according to the design requirements of the gimbal for size∗ weight, and integration difficulty, the gimbal structure was designed.Meanwhile, the static and modal analysis of the gimbal was carried out by using the finite element analysis software ANSYS.Secondly∗ the control system was designed and fabricated using embedded platforms.The system used a quaternion algorithm for attitude solution and a fusion algorithm of complementary filter for accelerorneter and gyroscope.Finally, dynamic and static tests were conducted for the attitude resolution accuracy of the gimbal system.The vibration-damping performance of the giinbal was tested for comparison.The results showed that the girnbal had good performance in strength and damping capacity.The algorithm and system can solve the head attitude information steadily and reliably, which can also command the motion of the gimbai following the operator's head attitude in real-time.The dynamic attitude angle error was less than 2°.The static attitude angle error was less than 5.5° in 600 s.This gimbal had good performance in vibration reduction and damping.In horizontal flight test, the RMS of vibration acceleration was 41.8% lower than the aerial photography girnbal.In the mobile test, the maximum peak amplitude of vibration acceleration was 21 % lower tha n the aerial photography gitnbal.This device can realize farmland monitoring tasks with UAV and provides better convenience.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true",
