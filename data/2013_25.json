After structure similarity was found to be an important factor, IQA metrics such as SSIM showed a better performance than traditional ones. With the usage of phase congruency (PC) to obtain structure similarity measurement, a new metric named FSIM acquired even higher consistency. This paper is motivated to propose an improved structure similarity metric based on FSIM, where quaternion wavelet transform is exploited to extract the quaternion phase congruency map to represent the essential image structures. In addition, complex phase congruency map obtained as the co-product during quaternion wavelet transform, supplies complementary visual effects of detailed structure on image quality assessment. The proposed image quality assessment metric based on hybrid phase congruency (HPC) (IQA-HPC) is highlighted in emphasizing saliency distribution of different image structures to image quality assessment. As compared with the state-of-the art IQA methods, experimental results demonstrate that the new index IQA-HPC is able to gain a higher consistency with the subjective measurement. © 2013 IEEE.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025084","afid":"60025084","affilname":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008691","afid":"60008691","affilname":"University of Shanghai for Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113931059","afid":"113931059","affilname":"Shanghai Key Lab of Digital Media Processing and Communication","affiliation-city":null,"affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55668745000","authid":"55668745000","authname":"Chen Q.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Qiwei","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113931059"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55695017800","authid":"55695017800","authname":"Xu Y.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Yi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113931059"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55937649500","authid":"55937649500","authname":"Li C.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Chuan","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008691"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56537447100","authid":"56537447100","authname":"Liu N.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Ning","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113931059"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7406503333","authid":"7406503333","authname":"Yang X.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Xiaokang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113931059"}]}],"authkeywords":"Hybrid Phase Congruency | Image Quality Assessment | Quaternion Wavelet Transform","article-number":"6618378","source-id":"21100268396","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"60932006","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84889241156"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84889241156?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84889241156&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84889241156&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84889241156","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84889241156","eid":"2-s2.0-84889241156","dc:title":"Color medical image registration based on quaternion","dc:creator":"Hua L.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Information and Computational Science","prism:issn":"15487741","prism:volume":"10","prism:issueIdentifier":"17","prism:pageRange":"5607-5617","prism:coverDate":"2013-11-20","prism:coverDisplayDate":"20 November 2013","prism:doi":"10.12733/jics20103231","dc:description":"Image registration technique has been widely studied and used in the field of medical diagnosis and treatment. Most methodologies adopted for registration of color image can be viewed as the extensions of related approaches for gray image. The 'R' channel, 'G' channel and 'B' channel of color image can be processed independently using gray image based processing method. However, the relationships between tri-channels are ignored, and the processed image will get distortion. In this paper, a novel color medical image registration method based on quaternion is put forward. Cross-correlation of two color images is transformed from frequency domain to time domain based on quaternion. The cross-correlation coefficients expression of quaternion matrix in time domain is put forward, deduced and proved. Good registration results are obtained by using registration algorithm of quaternion cross-correlation coefficients. Peak signal-to-noise ratio of processed image is relatively high. High registration precision is achieved without changing the relative position of RGB components. © 2013 Binary Information Press.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026282","afid":"60026282","affilname":"Zhejiang University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Hangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021783","afid":"60021783","affilname":"Nantong University","affiliation-city":"Nantong","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35195975900","authid":"35195975900","authname":"Hua L.","surname":"Hua","given-name":"Liang","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026282"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021783"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57196142394","authid":"57196142394","authname":"Huang Y.","surname":"Huang","given-name":"Yu","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026282"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55951846100","authid":"55951846100","authname":"Liu Y.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Yuqing","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021783"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403132986","authid":"7403132986","authname":"Ding L.","surname":"Ding","given-name":"Lijun","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026282"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35302377700","authid":"35302377700","authname":"Feng H.","surname":"Feng","given-name":"Hao","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021783"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403129551","authid":"7403129551","authname":"Gu J.","surname":"Gu","given-name":"Juping","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021783"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color medical image registration | Cross-correlation | Quaternion | Time domain","source-id":"144748","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84887546117"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84887546117?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84887546117&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84887546117&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84887546117","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84887546117","eid":"2-s2.0-84887546117","dc:title":"Extending Fourier transformations to Hamilton's quaternions and Clifford's geometric algebras","dc:creator":"Hitzer E.","prism:publicationName":"AIP Conference Proceedings","prism:issn":"0094243X","prism:eIssn":"15517616","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780735411845"}],"prism:volume":"1558","prism:pageRange":"30-34","prism:coverDate":"2013-11-19","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2013","prism:doi":"10.1063/1.4825413","dc:description":"We show how Fourier transformations can be extended to Hamilton's algebra of quaternions.

Sensor signals are measured and processed by a mobile computer; thus, the proposed system enables the analysis and diagnosis of postures during outdoor sports, as well as indoor activities. The measured signals are transformed into quaternion to avoid the Gimbal lock effect. In order to improve the precision of the proposed motion capture system in an open and outdoor space, a frequency-adaptive sensor fusion method and a kinematic model are utilized to construct the whole body motion in real-time. The reference point is continuously updated by smart shoes that measure the ground reaction forces. © 2013 IEEE.","citedby-count":"17","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60094206","afid":"60094206","affilname":"LG Electronics, Korea","affiliation-city":"Seoul","affiliation-country":"South Korea"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018257","afid":"60018257","affilname":"Sogang University","affiliation-city":"Seoul","affiliation-country":"South Korea"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55561892000","authid":"55561892000","authname":"Jung P.","surname":"Jung","given-name":"Pyeong Gook","initials":"P.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018257"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55561537400","authid":"55561537400","authname":"Lim G.","surname":"Lim","given-name":"Gukchan","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60094206"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24332189800","authid":"24332189800","authname":"Kong K.","surname":"Kong","given-name":"Kyoungchul","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018257"}]}],"article-number":"6630648","source-id":"25456","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84886799939"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84886799939?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84886799939&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84886799939&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84886799939","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84886799939","eid":"2-s2.0-84886799939","dc:title":"A recovery algorithm of star energy distribution for star sensor under high dynamic condition","dc:creator":"Wang C.","prism:publicationName":"Advanced Materials Research","prism:issn":"10226680","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783037858707"}],"prism:volume":"815","prism:pageRange":"187-192","prism:coverDate":"2013-11-06","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2013","prism:doi":"10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.815.187","dc:description":"Under the condition of high dynamic, there is a \"pixel shift\" phenomenon which is called smear in the star image sampled by star sensor. The recovery algorithm of star energy distributing for star sensor is presented in the paper. The quaternion of next frame is calculated with the previous continuous quaternion. All the ideal star coordinates of star image in the FOV is calculated with the quaternion of next frame. Then the angle between the two previous continuous axis directions is calculated with the previous continuous axis directions calculated with the previous continuous quaternion. The radius of threshold scan window of star image is calculated according to the angle. Finally, within the star image radius of the threshold scan window, shift the original star image to make the shifted star energy distribution continuous. So the star image distribution subjects to 2-D Gaussian distribution, and the star coordinates is obtain with centroiding algorithm.

Information from the sensors is processed by an attitude estimation program. Many of these algorithms were developed primarily for aeronautical applications. The parameters affecting the accuracy and stability of the system vary with the intended application. The performance of these algorithms occasionally destabilize during human motion tracking activities, which does not satisfy the reliability and high accuracy demand in biomedical application. A previous study accessed the feasibility of using semiconductor based inertial measurement units (IMUs) for human motion tracking. IMU hardware has been redesigned and an attitude estimation algorithm using sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, or particle filter, for quaternions was developed. The method presented in this paper uses von Mises-Fisher and a nonuniform simulation to provide density estimation of the rotation group SO(3).

Recently algebraic entities such as quaternions or Clifford algebras have been used to perform image processing for example. We propose to review several contributions for colour image processing by using the Quaternion algebra and the Clifford algebra. First, we illustrate how this formalism can be used to define colour alterations with algebraic operations. We generalise linear filtering algorithms already defined with quaternions and review a Clifford color edge detector. Clifford algebras appear to be an efficient mathematical tool to investigate the geometry of nD images. It has been shown for instance how to use quaternions for colour edge detection or to define an hypercomplex Fourier transform. The aim of the second part of this chapter is to present an example of applications, namely the Clifford Fourier transform of Clifford algebras to colour image processing.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032653","afid":"60032653","affilname":"Universite de Poitiers","affiliation-city":"Poitiers","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013717","afid":"60013717","affilname":"La Rochelle Université","affiliation-city":"La Rochelle","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book","subtype":"ch","subtypeDescription":"Book Chapter","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36008284700","authid":"36008284700","authname":"Carré P.","surname":"Carré","given-name":"Philippe","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032653"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35728359600","authid":"35728359600","authname":"Berthier M.","surname":"Berthier","given-name":"Michel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013717"}]}],"authkeywords":"Algebraic operations | Clifford | Fourier transform | Quaternion | Spatial filtering","source-id":"21100391956","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84891309423"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84891309423?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84891309423&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84891309423&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84891309423","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84891309423","eid":"2-s2.0-84891309423","dc:title":"Modulated quaternion lapped transform and its application in dual color image watermarking","dc:creator":"Chen B.","prism:publicationName":"Dongnan Daxue Xuebao (Ziran Kexue Ban)/Journal of Southeast University (Natural Science Edition)","prism:issn":"10010505","prism:volume":"43","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"1195-1202","prism:coverDate":"2013-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2013","prism:doi":"10.3969/j.issn.1001-0505.2013.06.012","dc:description":"In order to process color images holistically, by using the quaternion representation of color images and the algebra of quaternion, modulated quaternion lapped transform (MQLT) is defined to generalize the conventional modulated complex lapped transform (MCLT) for gray images and applied into the process of color images. Then, the symmetric properties of the MQLT coefficients are analyzed after the establishment of the relationships between the MQLT coefficients and the MCLT coefficients of three channels. Finally, combining with the Arnold transform and multiple redundant embedding strategy, a robust blind dual color image watermarking algorithm is proposed based on MQLT and its symmetric property. In order to avoid watermark energy loss, the MQLT coefficients are modified to embed watermarks according to their symmetric properties. The proposed algorithm fully utilizes four-dimensional MQLT domain and embeds a meaningful color watermark into a color host image. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the conventional component-wise algorithm based on the MCLT in terms of invisibility and robustness.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60106849","afid":"60106849","affilname":"Nanjing Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143","afid":"60064143","affilname":"Nanjing University of Information Science &amp; Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005244","afid":"60005244","affilname":"Southeast University","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36805188500","authid":"36805188500","authname":"Chen B.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Beijing","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55977923100","authid":"55977923100","authname":"Tian C.","surname":"Tian","given-name":"Cuicui","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55836038500","authid":"55836038500","authname":"Dai H.","surname":"Dai","given-name":"Hui","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60106849"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55978231100","authid":"55978231100","authname":"Wang D.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Dingcheng","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7203086899","authid":"7203086899","authname":"Shu H.","surname":"Shu","given-name":"Huazhong","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image | Digital watermarking | Modulated complex lapped transform | Quaternion","source-id":"21174","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84886638637"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84886638637?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84886638637&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84886638637&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84886638637","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84886638637","eid":"2-s2.0-84886638637","dc:title":"An improved method based on quaternion and planar segmentation fit in 3D registration","dc:creator":"Wang H.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering","prism:issn":"18761100","prism:eIssn":"18761119","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781447148463"}],"prism:volume":"218 LNEE","prism:issueIdentifier":"VOL. 3","prism:pageRange":"717-723","prism:coverDate":"2013-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2013","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-1-4471-4847-0_88","dc:description":"In this paper, we present a method of planar segmentation technique based on Quaternion for 3D registration.

Differing from traditional sparse image models, which represent RGB channels separately or process RGB channels as a concatenated real vector, the proposed model describes the color image as a quaternion vector matrix, where each color pixel is encoded as a quaternion unit and thus the inter-relationship among RGB channels is well preserved. Correspondingly, we propose a quaternion-based dictionary learning algorithm using a socalled K-QSVD method. It conducts the sparse basis selection in quaternion vector space, providing a kind of vectorial representation for the inherent color structures rather than a scalar representation via current sparse image models. The proposed sparse model is validated in the applications of color image denoising and inpainting. The experimental results demonstrate that our sparse image model avoids the hue bias phenomenon successfully and shows its potential as a powerful tool in color image analysis and processing domain. © 2013 IEEE.","citedby-count":"20","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025084","afid":"60025084","affilname":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113931059","afid":"113931059","affilname":"Shanghai Key Lab of Digital Media Processing and Communication","affiliation-city":null,"affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55609320200","authid":"55609320200","authname":"Yu L.","surname":"Yu","given-name":"Licheng","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113931059"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55695017800","authid":"55695017800","authname":"Xu Y.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Yi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113931059"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54788433800","authid":"54788433800","authname":"Xu H.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Hongteng","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113931059"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56061622900","authid":"56061622900","authname":"Zhang H.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Hao","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113931059"}]}],"authkeywords":"color images | Denoising | Dictionary learning | Inpainting | Quaternion | sparse Representation","article-number":"6607436","source-id":"20300195058","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"60932006","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84890521689"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84890521689?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84890521689&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84890521689&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84890521689","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84890521689","eid":"2-s2.0-84890521689","dc:title":"An algebraic real translation of hypercomplex linear systems and its application to adaptive filtering","dc:creator":"Mizoguchi T.","prism:publicationName":"ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - Proceedings","prism:issn":"15206149","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781479903566"}],"prism:pageRange":"6181-6185","prism:coverDate":"2013-10-18","prism:coverDisplayDate":"18 October 2013","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6638853","dc:description":"The hypercomplex (e.g., complex, quaternion) valued linear model often arises in the signal processing field and attract increasing attention recently.

We also clarify the useful algebraic properties of the translation. As an application to hypercomplex valued adaptive filtering problems, we derived Am-adaptive projected subgradient method (A m-APSM) for hypercomplex valued system identification problems, and show that many hypercomplex adaptive filtering algorithms can be viewed as a special case of this algorithm.

Recently a diffusion method is appeared, it allows to generalize the diffusion to the complex domain by the injection of a complex number in the heat equation. For small phase angles, the linear process generates the Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids (scale-spaces) simultaneously, depicted in the real and imaginary parts, respectively. The imaginary value serves as a robust edge-detector with increasing confidence in time, thus handles noise well and may serve as a controller for nonlinear processes. In this article we propose to extend this concept by introducing a notion of directionality in such a way as each equation of the system will correspond to a specific direction. It is in our interests to use higher order algebra to adapt the process to the four discrete directions. Then we will focus on the imaginary parts for developing a nonlinear scheme. © 2013 IEEE.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032653","afid":"60032653","affilname":"Universite de Poitiers","affiliation-city":"Poitiers","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57197268265","authid":"57197268265","authname":"Malek M.","surname":"Malek","given-name":"Mohamed","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032653"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12761288800","authid":"12761288800","authname":"Helbert D.","surname":"Helbert","given-name":"David","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032653"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36008284700","authid":"36008284700","authname":"Carre P.","surname":"Carre","given-name":"Philippe","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032653"}]}],"authkeywords":"complex diffusion | directional PDEs | higher order algebra | PDEs","article-number":"6637875","source-id":"110544","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84890498418"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84890498418?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84890498418&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84890498418&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84890498418","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84890498418","eid":"2-s2.0-84890498418","dc:title":"Quaternion-based worst case constrained beamformer based on electromagnetic vector-sensor arrays","dc:creator":"Zhang X.","prism:publicationName":"ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - Proceedings","prism:issn":"15206149","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781479903566"}],"prism:pageRange":"4149-4153","prism:coverDate":"2013-10-18","prism:coverDisplayDate":"18 October 2013","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6638440","dc:description":"A robust adaptive beamforming scheme based on two-component electromagnetic (EM) vector-sensor arrays is proposed by extending the well-known worst-case constraint into the quaternionic domain.

Numerical simulations show that our quaternion-based robust beamformer significantly outperforms the sample matrix inversion minimum variance distortionless response (SMI-MVDR) beamformer and the quaternion Capon (Q-Capon) beamformer in the presence of steering vector mismatches. © 2013 IEEE.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016835","afid":"60016835","affilname":"Beijing Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001881","afid":"60001881","affilname":"The University of Sheffield","affiliation-city":"Sheffield","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24765534000","authid":"24765534000","authname":"Zhang X.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xirui","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001881"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56645219600","authid":"56645219600","authname":"Liu W.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001881"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16320275100","authid":"16320275100","authname":"Xu Y.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Yougen","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192586797","authid":"57192586797","authname":"Liu Z.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Zhiwen","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]}],"authkeywords":"quaternion | Robust adaptive beamformer | vector-sensor array | worst case constraint","article-number":"6638440","source-id":"110544","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84890450533"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84890450533?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84890450533&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84890450533&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84890450533","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84890450533","eid":"2-s2.0-84890450533","dc:title":"Hyper-complex wave phase coherent based image motion estimation","dc:creator":"Wang C.","prism:publicationName":"Chinese Control Conference, CCC","prism:issn":"19341768","prism:eIssn":"21612927","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789881563835"}],"prism:pageRange":"3645-3650","prism:coverDate":"2013-10-18","prism:coverDisplayDate":"18 October 2013","dc:description":"A hyper-complex wavelet phase coherent method is presented in this paper to detect image micro motion.

The results of experiments show that the new method has good correlation with perceived video quality when tested on the video quality experts group (VQEG) Phase IFR-TV test data set. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031419","afid":"60031419","affilname":"Ningbo University","affiliation-city":"Ningbo","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57857808700","authid":"57857808700","authname":"Li G.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Gang","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031419"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55869850800","authid":"55869850800","authname":"Aizimaiti A.","surname":"Aizimaiti","given-name":"Ainiwaer","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031419"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192565343","authid":"57192565343","authname":"Liu Y.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Yan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031419"}]}],"authkeywords":"Normalization | Quaternion | Structural similarity | Video quality assessment","source-id":"4700151914","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
