This algorithm combines the robustness of SURF to detect and match a good feature, and the accuracy of the Adaptive ICP algorithm, which is used to give more importance for near 3D weighted points with their inverse depth. The proposed algorithm is validated and compared to other optimization techniques based on Singular Values Decomposition (SVD) and Quaternion.

Secondly, the sample vector was input to the composite quaternion filter. The extracted feature vector was obtained by using the variance of the real part and imaginary part. Finally, the neural network was applied as classifier and the reject class was introduced in the banknote recognition.

The Xilinx FPGA (V7 xc7vx1140tflg1930-1) is selected as the hardware platform for the real-time processing. In FPGA implementation: ①We adopt a 64-bit floating point data structure and a strategy of combination of serial and parallel processing; ②a lower-upper (LU) decomposition-block algorithm is adopted for matrix inversion. The experimental results indicate that the number of iterations of the proposed algorithm is 13 less than the Eulerian angle-based algorithm. The difference of FPGA and PC implementation is about 5.0×10 -14 and the speedup is about 10, which meets the requirements of precision and speed for on-board image real time processing.

We compared the noise tolerance of CQHNNs and QHNNs by computer simulation, and discuss the simulation results from the perspective of rotational invariance and self loops.","citedby-count":"38","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009064","afid":"60009064","affilname":"University of Yamanashi","affiliation-city":"Kofu","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55741799500","authid":"55741799500","orcid":"0000-0002-4453-0615","authname":"Kobayashi M.","surname":"Kobayashi","given-name":"Masaki","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009064"}]}],"authkeywords":"Commutative quaternion | Complex-valued Hopfield neural network | Multistate neuron | Projection rule","source-id":"24807","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85072194012"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85072194012?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85072194012&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85072194012&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85072194012","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85072194012","eid":"2-s2.0-85072194012","dc:title":"Attitude measurement system of cutting head for boom-type roadheader based on vision measurement","dc:creator":"Yang W.","prism:publicationName":"Meitan Xuebao/Journal of the China Coal Society","prism:issn":"02539993","prism:volume":"43","prism:pageRange":"581-590","prism:coverDate":"2018-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 December 2018","prism:doi":"10.13225/j.cnki.jccs.2018.0558","dc:description":"In order to realize a real time automatic detection of cutting head attitude, this paper puts forward a new method for the attitude measurement of cutting head by using visual measuring technique, which does not need to change the structure of the cutting head. The system took infrared LED in the target that was installed in the cutting part as a source of information, and the attitude's resolution modeling of cutting head was built through the analysis of imaging features of the infrared LED feature point. The image of infrared LED was collected by an explosion-proof industrial camera; the center of feature points was determined by using Gauss curved method; a linear idea for solving the P4P question was taken to obtain spatial three-dimensional coordinates of feature points; the error model was established based on dual quaternion; and the attitude calculation of cutting head was completed based on the optimal position calculating model. On the basis of above theoretical analysis, the attitude measurement experimental platform was build up in laboratory conditions to simulate the pose change of cutting head. The experimental results show that the measurement accuracy of angles is within the 0.5 degree, which can meet the requirement of the automatic, accurate and real-time attitude measurement of roadheader's cutting head.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030867","afid":"60030867","affilname":"Xi'an University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/121849977","afid":"121849977","affilname":"Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Mine Electromechanical Equipment Intelligent Monitoring","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206587271","authid":"57206587271","authname":"Yang W.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Wenjuan","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030867"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"121849977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55723497500","authid":"55723497500","authname":"Ma H.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Hongwei","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030867"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"121849977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57212679634","authid":"57212679634","authname":"Zhang X.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xuhui","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030867"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"121849977"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude measurement | Boom-type roadheader | Dual quaternion | Gauss curved | Vision measurement","source-id":"16430","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058174197"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058174197?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85058174197&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85058174197&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058174197","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85058174197","eid":"2-s2.0-85058174197","dc:title":"Self-Tuning Proportional Double Derivative-Like Neural Network Controller for a Quadrotor","dc:creator":"Tran T.T.","prism:publicationName":"International Journal of Aeronautical and Space Sciences","prism:issn":"2093274X","prism:eIssn":"20932480","prism:volume":"19","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"976-985","prism:coverDate":"2018-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 December 2018","prism:doi":"10.1007/s42405-018-0091-6","dc:description":"In this paper, a self-tuning proportional double derivative-like neural network nonlinear adaptive controller for attitude tracking control of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is presented.

The simulation data showed that the accuracy of the correction error of this method reached 89.8%, and every star point coordinate required 0.259 s to calculate, on average.

In this paper, a new method for robust image hashing based on quaternion polar complex exponential transform (QPCET) is proposed. The proposed method targets two goals. The first goal is the robustness against geometric and common signal processing attacks. The second one is authenticating color images without conversion which keeps their color information. In the proposed method, the input color image is normalized by the bicubic interpolation and then the interpolated image passes to Gaussian low-pass filter. QPCET moments are used to extract features. Finally, the hash value is calculated using the extracted features. On the sender side, a secret key is utilized to increase the protection of the hash value before transmitting it. The hash value is attached with the transmitted color image. On the receiver side, the authenticity of the received image is checked by decrypting the hash value. Euclidean distance is used to check the similarity between different hashes. Results of the conducted experiments prove the robustness of proposed hash against different geometric and signal processing attacks. Also, it preserves the content of the transmitted color image. Hashing different images has a very low collision probability which ensure the suitability of the proposed method for image authentication. Comparison with the existing methods ensures the superiority of the proposed method.","citedby-count":"22","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60274165","afid":"60274165","affilname":"Faculty of Computers and Information","affiliation-city":"Zagazig","affiliation-country":"Egypt"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205214086","authid":"57205214086","orcid":"0000-0001-8065-8977","authname":"Hosny K.M.","surname":"Hosny","given-name":"Khalid M.","initials":"K.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60274165"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204723919","authid":"57204723919","orcid":"0000-0002-3250-4663","authname":"Khedr Y.M.","surname":"Khedr","given-name":"Yasmeen M.","initials":"Y.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60274165"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35318116100","authid":"35318116100","orcid":"0000-0002-4707-0861","authname":"Khedr W.I.","surname":"Khedr","given-name":"Walid I.","initials":"W.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60274165"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201421221","authid":"57201421221","orcid":"0000-0002-9643-6719","authname":"Mohamed E.R.","surname":"Mohamed","given-name":"Ehab R.","initials":"E.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60274165"}]}],"authkeywords":"Geometric attacks | Image authentication | Image hashing | Quaternion polar complex exponential transform moment | ROC","source-id":"18780","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055878079"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055878079?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85055878079&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85055878079&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055878079","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85055878079","eid":"2-s2.0-85055878079","dc:title":"Quaternion-Based Sparse Model for Pan-Sharpening of IRS Satellite Images","dc:creator":"Synthiya Vinothini D.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing","prism:issn":"0255660X","prism:eIssn":"09743006","prism:volume":"46","prism:issueIdentifier":"12","prism:pageRange":"2069-2079","prism:coverDate":"2018-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 December 2018","prism:doi":"10.1007/s12524-018-0878-8","dc:description":"This paper considers the pan-sharpening problem of the IRS satellite images from the perspective of vector sparse representation model using quaternion matrix analysis. It selects the sparse basis in quaternion space, which uniformly transforms the color channels into an orthogonal color space.

This paper also proposes a quaternion forward–backward pursuit algorithm that preserves the inherent chromatic structures in terms of spatial and spectral details during the vector reconstruction.

We are interested in segmenting objects with large variety in app.earance, from lack of texture to presence of strong textures, with a focus on the task of robotic grasping. The proposed pipeline is divided into an object segmentation part and a pose estimation part. We first find candidate object clusters using a graph-based image segmentation technique. A modified Canny edge detector is introduced for extracting robust graph edges by fusing RGB and depth information. A suitable cost function is used for building the graph, which is then partitioned using the concept of internal and external differences between graph regions. The extracted object regions are then used to initialize the 3D position of a quaternion-based Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (Q-PSO), that fits a 3D model of the object to the depth image. The fitness function is based on depth information only and the quaternion formulation avoids singularities and the need for conversions between rotation representations. In this work we focus on the details of the GPU implementation of Q-PSO, in order to fully exploit the highly parallelizable nature of the particular implementation of the particle swarm algorithm, and discuss critic implementation details. We then test the app.roach on different publicly available RGB-D object datasets, and provide numeric comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods, as well as a discussion on robustness and an extension to the case of articulated objects. We show how Q-PSO offers comparable performances to current learning-based app.roaches, while not suffering from the problems of lack of features in objects or issues related to training, such as the need for a large training set and long training times.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026851","afid":"60026851","affilname":"University of Oxford","affiliation-city":"Oxford","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012162","afid":"60012162","affilname":"Politecnico di Torino","affiliation-city":"Turin","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/53867082700","authid":"53867082700","authname":"Rosa S.","surname":"Rosa","given-name":"Stefano","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026851"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57035380900","authid":"57035380900","authname":"Toscana G.","surname":"Toscana","given-name":"Giorgio","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012162"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35579762500","authid":"35579762500","authname":"Bona B.","surname":"Bona","given-name":"Basilio","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012162"}]}],"authkeywords":"GPU | Object pose estimation | Particle swarm optimization | Robotic grasping","source-id":"24360","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85023189195"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85023189195?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85023189195&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85023189195&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85023189195","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85023189195","eid":"2-s2.0-85023189195","dc:title":"Design and Analysis of Quaternion-Valued Neural Networks for Associative Memories","dc:creator":"Chen X.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","prism:issn":"21682216","prism:eIssn":"21682232","prism:volume":"48","prism:issueIdentifier":"12","prism:pageRange":"2305-2314","prism:coverDate":"2018-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2018","prism:doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2017.2717866","dc:description":"This paper addresses the problem of designing associative memories based on quaternion-valued neural networks (QVNNs).

Their polarization is essential to characterize the physical and dynamical properties of the source i.e., a coalescing binary of two compact objects such as black holes or neutron stars. Observations with two or more non coaligned detectors like Virgo and LIGO allow to reconstruct the two polarization components usually denoted by h+(t) and h×(t). The amplitude and phase relationship between the two components is related to the source orientation with respect to the observer. Therefore the evolution of the polarization pattern provides evidence for changes in the orientation due to precession or nutation of the binary. Usually, some specific direct dynamical model is exploited to identify the physical parameters of such binaries. Recently, a new framework for the time-frequency analysis of bivariate signals based on a quaternion Fourier transform has been introduced in [1]. It permits to analyze the bivariate signal combining h+(t) and h×(t) by defining its quaternion embedding as well as a set of non-parametric observables, namely Stokes parameters. These parameters are remarkably capable of measuring fine properties of the source, in particular by deciphering precession, without close bounds to a specific dynamical model.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60123796","afid":"60123796","affilname":"Université Paris Cité","affiliation-city":"Paris","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104665","afid":"60104665","affilname":"Université de Lille","affiliation-city":"Lille","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104170","afid":"60104170","affilname":"Grenoble Images Parole Signal Automatique","affiliation-city":"Saint Martin d'Heres","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189218541","authid":"57189218541","authname":"Flamant J.","surname":"Flamant","given-name":"Julien","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104665"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6505961382","authid":"6505961382","authname":"Chainais P.","surname":"Chainais","given-name":"Pierre","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104665"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35227036700","authid":"35227036700","authname":"Chassande-Mottin E.","surname":"Chassande-Mottin","given-name":"Eric","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60123796"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57650756800","authid":"57650756800","authname":"Feng F.","surname":"Feng","given-name":"Fangchen","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60123796"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6507015909","authid":"6507015909","authname":"Le Bihan N.","surname":"Le Bihan","given-name":"Nicolas","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104170"}]}],"article-number":"8552942","source-id":"21100204301","fund-acr":"ANR","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Agence Nationale de la Recherche","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059822100"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059822100?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059822100&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059822100&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059822100","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85059822100","eid":"2-s2.0-85059822100","dc:title":"Octonion spectrum of 3D octonion-valued signals - Properties and possible applications","dc:creator":"Błaszczyk Ł.","prism:publicationName":"European Signal Processing Conference","prism:issn":"22195491","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789082797015"}],"prism:volume":"2018-September","prism:pageRange":"509-513","prism:coverDate":"2018-11-29","prism:coverDisplayDate":"29 November 2018","prism:doi":"10.23919/EUSIPCO.2018.8553228","dc:description":"The aim of this paper is to investigate the properties of octonion Fourier transform (OFT) of octonion-valued functions of three variables and its potential applications in signal processing. This work has been inspired by the original papers by Hahn and Snopek concerning octonion Fourier transform definition and its applications in the analysis of the hypercomplex analytic signals. First, the generalization of the OFT definition to the octonion-valued functions is provided, and then the octonion analogues of classical Fourier transform properties are derived, e.g. argument scaling, modulation and shift theorem. Finally, the results are illustrated with some examples that indicate possible applications.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003675","afid":"60003675","affilname":"Politechnika Warszawska","affiliation-city":"Warsaw","affiliation-country":"Poland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56007862100","authid":"56007862100","authname":"Błaszczyk Ł.","surname":"Błaszczyk","given-name":"Łukasz","initials":"Ł.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003675"}]}],"article-number":"8553228","source-id":"21100204301","fund-acr":"NCN","fund-no":"2016/23/N/ST7/00131","fund-sponsor":"Narodowe Centrum Nauki","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
