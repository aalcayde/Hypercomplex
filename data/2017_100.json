CNN is composed of input, convolution, pooling, hidden and output layers, and the weights and biases between layers except the ones between convolution and pooling layers are acquired by learning. In comparison to the conventional neural networks, the learning cost of CNN is higher, and the learning time is longer especially when hidden layer(s) are added. Recently, complex- and quaternion-valued neural networks have drawn much attention. In complex-valued neural networks, inputs, weights, biases and outputs are complex numbers, and in quaternion-valued neural networks, these parameters are quaternions. It has been shown that both methods exhibit excellent accuracy in various applications such as classification and function approximation problems with less computational burden. In this study, we propose CNNs with complex- and quaternion-valued neurons where complex and quaternion numbers are used between pooling, hidden and output layers. We here show that CNNs with complex- and quaternion-valued neurons have higher learning ability in handwritten digit image classification with the MNIST data than the real-valued counterpart.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60107433","afid":"60107433","affilname":"Aisin AW Co., Ltd.","affiliation-city":"Aichi","affiliation-country":"Japan"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010848","afid":"60010848","affilname":"University of Fukui","affiliation-city":"Fukui","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57196023178","authid":"57196023178","authname":"Kominami Y.","surname":"Kominami","given-name":"Yuki","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010848"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57196027545","authid":"57196027545","authname":"Ogawa H.","surname":"Ogawa","given-name":"Hideki","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60107433"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202041770","authid":"7202041770","authname":"Murase K.","surname":"Murase","given-name":"Kazuyuki","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010848"}]}],"authkeywords":"Classification | Complex-valued neural network | Convolutional neural network | Pattern recognition | Quaternion-valued neural network","article-number":"7966183","source-id":"96537","fund-no":"15K00333","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049496916"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049496916?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85049496916&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85049496916&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049496916","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85049496916","eid":"2-s2.0-85049496916","dc:title":"Continuous-valued quaternionic hopfield neural network for image retrieval: A color space study","dc:creator":"De Castro F.Z.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - 2017 Brazilian Conference on Intelligent Systems, BRACIS 2017","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538624074"}],"prism:volume":"2018-January","prism:pageRange":"186-191","prism:coverDate":"2017-06-28","prism:coverDisplayDate":"28 June 2017","prism:doi":"10.1109/BRACIS.2017.52","dc:description":"Continuous-valued quaternionic Hopfield neural network (CV-QHNN) generalizes the traditional Hopfield network for the storage and retrieval of vectors whose components are unit quaternions.

We point out that a direct conversion from the RGB to unit quaternions may result distortions in which visually different colors are mapped into close quaternions.

The decoupling of three-channel angular acceleration is obtained by two tracking differentiators, and the uncertainties of the model are estimated by using an extended state observer. The equivalent pendulum angle or RCS (Reaction Control System) control signals of three-channel engine is calculated through dynamic inversion and is filtered by digital filter. Nonlinear 6-D simulation analysis on the reusable launch vehicle is carried out from the ascent phase to the reentry phase, which takes into account the system model's various external disturbances, such as nonlinearity, uncertainty, 11th-order elastic vibration, liquid sloshing, wind disturbance, and the aerodynamic deviation, etc..

In addition, the measurement equations of navigation sensors are given according to the measuring characteristics. In order to deal with the strong-nonlinearity and non-Gaussian measurement noise of the relative navigation system, a robust high-degree cubature filter is designed based on the combination of high-degree cubature filter and Huber-based measurement update equations. The novel filter has higher estimated accuracy and is robust to the mixed Gaussian noise. The relative attitude is denoted by quaternions, and in order to ensure the normalization of the quaternions, the modified Rodrigues parameters are utilized to denote the attitude errors in designing the relative navigation filter.

However, for almost all the models, and especially for adaptive beamforming, the desired signal is still complex-valued as in the quaternion-valued Capon beamformer. Since the complex-valued desired signal only has two components, while there are four components in a quaternion, only two components of the quaternion-valued beamformer output are used and the remaining two are simply discarded, leading to significant redundancy in its implementation. In this work, we consider a quaternion-valued desired signal and develop a fully quaternion-valued Capon beamformer which has a better performance and a much lower complexity. Furthermore, based on this full quaternion model, the robust beamforming problem is also studied in the presence of steering vector errors and a worst-case-based robust beamformer is developed. The performance of the proposed methods is verified by computer simulations.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001881","afid":"60001881","affilname":"The University of Sheffield","affiliation-city":"Sheffield","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57224072637","authid":"57224072637","authname":"Lan X.","surname":"Lan","given-name":"Xiang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001881"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56645219600","authid":"56645219600","authname":"Liu W.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001881"}]}],"authkeywords":"Capon beamformer | Crossed-dipole | Quaternion model | Robust beamforming | Vector sensor array","article-number":"34","source-id":"21100829272","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85017175747"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85017175747?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85017175747&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85017175747&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85017175747","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85017175747","eid":"2-s2.0-85017175747","dc:title":"Fractional Riesz–Hilbert-Type Transforms and Associated Monogenic Signals","dc:creator":"Bernstein S.","prism:publicationName":"Complex Analysis and Operator Theory","prism:issn":"16618254","prism:eIssn":"16618262","prism:volume":"11","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"995-1015","prism:coverDate":"2017-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 June 2017","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11785-017-0667-3","dc:description":"The fractional Hilbert transforms play a significant role in optics and signal processing because they interpolate between the near field and the far field.

In this paper, the correlation of four-channel signals is described by the quaternion domain, and a quaternion singular spectrum analysis method based on the convex optimization is proposed. Singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is used to analyze a single channel vibration signal in the phase space, which is performed by different singular spectrum characteristics of the trajectory matrix. For the signal processing in the quaternion domain, the trajectory matrixes developed by embedding procedure of four channels are employed to generate the augmented trajectory matrix. Then, the useful signal and unwanted signal such as noise can be distinguished by quaternion singular value decomposition (QSVD) to augmented trajectory matrix. It should also be noted that the convex optimization with non-convex penalty functions for QSVD is utilized to accurately estimate non-zero singular value, which can be set as regularization item in the matrix low-rank approximation. The proposed method is validated through numerical simulation signal and experimental signal. By comparing the results obtained from the proposed method, signal channel Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), SSA and multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD), it is found that the application of the proposed model leads to a better solution to extract the feature frequency in mechanical fault diagnosis.","citedby-count":"71","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60087684","afid":"60087684","affilname":"New York Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Old Westbury","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014643","afid":"60014643","affilname":"Wuhan University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190026628","authid":"57190026628","authname":"Yi C.","surname":"Yi","given-name":"Cancan","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014643"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014643"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36989875000","authid":"36989875000","authname":"Lv Y.","surname":"Lv","given-name":"Yong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014643"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014643"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190028659","authid":"57190028659","authname":"Dang Z.","surname":"Dang","given-name":"Zhang","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014643"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014643"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/50362360900","authid":"50362360900","authname":"Xiao H.","surname":"Xiao","given-name":"Han","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014643"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014643"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15027719900","authid":"15027719900","authname":"Yu X.","surname":"Yu","given-name":"Xun","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014643"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014643"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60087684"}]}],"authkeywords":"Convex optimization | Fault diagnosis | Non-convex regularization | Quaternion | Singular spectrum analysis","source-id":"15424","fund-acr":"UC","fund-no":"51475339","fund-sponsor":"University of Cincinnati","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85000885412"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85000885412?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85000885412&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85000885412&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85000885412","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85000885412","eid":"2-s2.0-85000885412","dc:title":"Quaternionic Wiener–Khinchine Theorems and Spectral Representation of Convolution with Steerable Two-sided Quaternion Fourier Transform","dc:creator":"Hitzer E.","prism:publicationName":"Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras","prism:issn":"01887009","prism:eIssn":"16614909","prism:volume":"27","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"1313-1328","prism:coverDate":"2017-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 June 2017","prism:doi":"10.1007/s00006-016-0744-0","dc:description":"In this paper we use the general two-sided quaternion Fourier transform (QFT) in order to derive Wiener–Khinchine theorems for the cross-correlation and for the auto-correlation of quaternion signals.

By using the quaternion matrix representation, the R, G, B information of each pixel is not destroyed and it can be taken as a organic body. Therefore, this paper proposes a quaternion based maximum margin criterion (QMMC) algorithm. Firstly, the quaternion number is used to denote the pixel of the color image, and a quaternion vector is taken to represent the color image. Secondly, the maximum margin criterion algorithm is used to project the quaternion vector in the high-dimension space into a low-dimension space. Finally, the nearest neighbor classification are taken for classification recognition. Numerous experiments show that the proposed QMMC can achieve better recognition performance.","citedby-count":"21","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073587","afid":"60073587","affilname":"Henan University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Luoyang","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030004","afid":"60030004","affilname":"Xihua University","affiliation-city":"Chengdu","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000174","afid":"60000174","affilname":"Shaanxi Normal University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56335186500","authid":"56335186500","authname":"Liu Z.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Zhonghua","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073587"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57198663978","authid":"57198663978","authname":"Qiu Y.","surname":"Qiu","given-name":"Yong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073587"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14042266200","authid":"14042266200","authname":"Peng Y.","surname":"Peng","given-name":"Yali","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000174"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55436781800","authid":"55436781800","authname":"Pu J.","surname":"Pu","given-name":"Jiexin","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073587"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56957256400","authid":"56957256400","authname":"Zhang X.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xiaoli","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030004"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color face recognition | Feature extraction | Quaternion matrix | Quaternion representation based maximum margin criterion","source-id":"24806","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"2014ZCX013","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85030553394"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85030553394?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85030553394&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85030553394&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85030553394","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85030553394","eid":"2-s2.0-85030553394","dc:title":"A Low-Complexity DOA and Polarization Method of Polarization-Sensitive Array","dc:creator":"Dong W.","prism:publicationName":"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","prism:eIssn":"14248220","prism:volume":"17","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2017-05-20","prism:coverDisplayDate":"20 May 2017","prism:doi":"10.3390/s17051170","dc:description":"This paper proposes a low-complexity method to estimate the direction of arrival and polarization based on the polarization sensitive array (PSA) which is composed of cross-dipoles.

Finally, the polarizations were estimated by generalized eigenvalue method. Unlike some existing searching algorithms, such as multiple signal classification (MUSIC), this method can avoid the peak searching and maintains high estimation accuracy. Moreover, we use the oblique projection operators to filter out the interference signals which are decoys of the target signal.

The proposed wearable inertial pedestrian navigation system is constructed by integrating a triaxial accelerometer, a triaxial gyroscope, a triaxial magnetometer, a microcontroller, and a Bluetooth wireless transmission module. Users wear the system on foot while walking in indoor and outdoor environments at normal speed without any external positioning techniques. During walking movement, the measured inertial signals generated from walking movements are transmitted to a computer via the wireless module. Based on the foot-mounted inertial pedestrian navigation system, a pedestrian trajectory reconstruction algorithm composed of the procedures of inertial signal acquisition, signal preprocessing, trajectory reconstruction, and trajectory height estimation has been developed to reconstruct floor walking and stair climbing trajectories. In order to minimize the cumulative error of the inertial signals, we have utilized a sensor fusion technique based on a double-stage quaternion-based extended Kalman filter to fuse acceleration, angular velocity, and magnetic signals. Experimental results have successfully validated the effectiveness of the proposed wearable inertial pedestrian navigation system and its associated pedestrian trajectory reconstruction algorithm.","citedby-count":"76","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014982","afid":"60014982","affilname":"National Cheng Kung University","affiliation-city":"Tainan","affiliation-country":"Taiwan"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004879","afid":"60004879","affilname":"Feng Chia University","affiliation-city":"Taichung","affiliation-country":"Taiwan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36729819300","authid":"36729819300","authname":"Hsu Y.L.","surname":"Hsu","given-name":"Yu Liang","initials":"Y.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004879"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7701313582","authid":"7701313582","authname":"Wang J.S.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Jeen Shing","initials":"J.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014982"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58161668400","authid":"58161668400","authname":"Chang C.W.","surname":"Chang","given-name":"Che Wei","initials":"C.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014982"}]}],"authkeywords":"Inertial positioning system | Pedestrian navigation | Pedestrian trajectory reconstruction | Quaternion-based extended Kalman filter | Sensor fusion","article-number":"7873281","source-id":"15047","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992497470"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992497470?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84992497470&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84992497470&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992497470","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84992497470","eid":"2-s2.0-84992497470","dc:title":"Quaternion Fourier and linear canonical inversion theorems","dc:creator":"Hu X.","prism:publicationName":"Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences","prism:issn":"01704214","prism:eIssn":"10991476","prism:volume":"40","prism:issueIdentifier":"7","prism:pageRange":"2421-2440","prism:coverDate":"2017-05-15","prism:coverDisplayDate":"15 May 2017","prism:doi":"10.1002/mma.4148","dc:description":"The quaternion Fourier transform (QFT) is one of the key tools in studying color image processing.

By boosting the local minutiae matching step, we avoid consolidation and global matching. To show the added-value of our method, several algorithms for extracting and matching m-triplets are considered and an experimental comparison is established.

The security of the medical images over the DICOM network currently relies on encryption techniques such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES). These techniques however consume substantial processing time for the medical images. A new lossless encryption technique using quaternions can be adopted which reduces the processing time enormously. The quaternion technique is implemented using counter mode of encryption and modular arithmetic operations. The security of the medical image transmission can even be enhanced by incorporating digital watermarking which serves as an authentication of the sender and also reduces the difficulty in maintenance of multiple documents. The signature of the patient and the patient data are used as the watermark images and they are embedded in the DICOM image using DWT-SVD (Digital Wavelet Transform-Singular Value Decomposition).","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019335","afid":"60019335","affilname":"Coimbatore Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Coimbatore","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194439857","authid":"57194439857","authname":"Fathima Nasreen K.","surname":"Fathima Nasreen","given-name":"K.","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019335"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57217270766","authid":"57217270766","authname":"Chitra P.","surname":"Chitra","given-name":"P.","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019335"}]}],"authkeywords":"DICOM | Digital watermarking | DWT | Encryption | Image processing | Quaternions | SVD","article-number":"7916764","source-id":"21100817594","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85020161407"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85020161407?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85020161407&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85020161407&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85020161407","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85020161407","eid":"2-s2.0-85020161407","dc:title":"PID controller tuned using Simulated Annealing for assured crew re-entry vehicle with PWPF thruster firing","dc:creator":"Vijay D.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of 2016 Online International Conference on Green Engineering and Technologies, IC-GET 2016","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781509045563"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2017-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 May 2017","prism:doi":"10.1109/GET.2016.7916804","dc:description":"An attitude control system is proposed for an assured crew re-entry vehicle, where the control law is based PID controller tuned using Simulated Annealing.

The system state remains in the neighborhood of a reference attitude and the control signal is close to a well-defined equivalent control. To ensure the effectiveness of the system, the PID controller tuned using Simulated Annealing is compared with conventional PID controller results. The reference attitude is obtained in terms of the command angles and the outputs given by the trajectory controller.

Then the watermark is embedded into the magnitudes of low-frequency information of QDFT. In watermark decoding process, the synchronous correction based on FLS-SVM model is used. When training the FLS-SVM model, we firstly perform the quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) of the grayscale images that correspond to the color training images, and then use BKF distribution to fit the empirical histogram of coefficients of the QWT, and finally use the shape parameters and scale parameters of BKF distribution to construct image feature vector. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is not only invisible, but also has outstanding robustness against common image processing attacks and geometric attacks.","citedby-count":"68","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004538","afid":"60004538","affilname":"Dalian University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55318994100","authid":"55318994100","authname":"Wang C.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Chunpeng","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9735589400","authid":"9735589400","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xingyuan","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192071212","authid":"57192071212","authname":"Zhang C.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Chuan","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188991071","authid":"57188991071","authname":"Xia Z.","surname":"Xia","given-name":"Zhiqiu","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]}],"authkeywords":"Bessel K form distribution | Color image watermarking | Fuzzy least squares support vector machine | Quaternion discrete Fourier transform | Quaternion wavelet transform","source-id":"25548","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61173183","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84995537875"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84995537875?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84995537875&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84995537875&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84995537875","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84995537875","eid":"2-s2.0-84995537875","dc:title":"Stokes parameters and DOAs estimation of partially polarized sources using a EM vector sensor","dc:creator":"Tao J.w.","prism:publicationName":"Signal, Image and Video Processing","prism:issn":"18631703","prism:eIssn":"18631711","prism:volume":"11","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"737-744","prism:coverDate":"2017-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 May 2017","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11760-016-1017-z","dc:description":"In this paper, the problem of polarization and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation using an electromagnetic (EM) vector sensor is addressed based on the augmented second-order statistics of quaternions. The augmented quaternion model of an EM vector sensor is introduced by employing the augmented second-order statistics of quaternions, which include the information in both the standard covariance and the pseudo-covariance. The fact is revealed that the Stokes parameters of an EM wave can be extracted from an augmented covariance matrix. An augmented quaternion-based approach is proposed for the Stokes parameters and DOA estimation of polarized EM waves. The proposed approach uses only information in three imaginary parts of both the standard covariance and the pseudo-covariance matrix. In theory, it is guaranteed to remove the effect of the additive noise which is uncorrelated between measurement channels. The proposed approach is applicable to both completely polarized and partially polarized EM waves. Simulations are used to verify the performance of the proposed approach.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073486","afid":"60073486","affilname":"Aviation University of Air Force","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8534150300","authid":"8534150300","authname":"Tao J.w.","surname":"Tao","given-name":"Jian wu","initials":"J.w.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073486"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55548257500","authid":"55548257500","authname":"Fan Q.j.","surname":"Fan","given-name":"Qiong jian","initials":"Q.j.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073486"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54929198600","authid":"54929198600","authname":"Yu F.","surname":"Yu","given-name":"Fei","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073486"}]}],"authkeywords":"EM vector sensor | Polarized signal processing | Quaternion widely linear processing | Stokes parameters and DOA estimation","source-id":"6200180165","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61571462","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963946934"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963946934?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84963946934&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84963946934&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963946934","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84963946934","eid":"2-s2.0-84963946934","dc:title":"Multimodal Image Registration With Line Segments by Selective Search","dc:creator":"Li Y.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","prism:issn":"21682267","prism:volume":"47","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"1285-1298","prism:coverDate":"2017-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May 2017","prism:doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2016.2548484","dc:description":"This paper proposes a line segment-based image registration method.

Those triplets (quaternions) of lines resulting in higher similarity metrics are preserved, and their intersections are refined by an iterative process or random sample consensus. The proposed method is tested on indoor and outdoor EO/IR image pairs, and the average registration error is calculated to be compared with existing algorithms.

The main factors affecting accuracy of stereo-vision system were analyzed and the error track chain of vision system was listed, which can explain the accuracy bottleneck in vision system with large FOV. Then, laser tracker was adopted to calculate the rigid body transformation with unit quaternion method, thus achieving virtual point clouds with high precision. Subsequently, 3-order radial distortion and 2-order tangential distortion were involved in the mathematic camera distortion model. In addition, the calibration parameters were solved through Levenberg-Marquardt iterative algorithm, which can improve the accuracy moderately. In the experiment, the binocular stereo vision measuring system was designed with FOV of 4 m×3 m×2 m. The results show that the reconstruction mean error for 152 group data of lateral distances is -0.003 mm and the standard deviation is 0.08 mm in the detection of a high-precision guide rail. Compared with the conventional plane calibration method, the measuring accuracy of the stereo calibration method has been greatly improved.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023813","afid":"60023813","affilname":"Shanghai University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56040397900","authid":"56040397900","authname":"Zhang X.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xi","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194176469","authid":"57194176469","authname":"Cheng D.Q.","surname":"Cheng","given-name":"Dong Qin","initials":"D.Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56795977800","authid":"56795977800","authname":"Li W.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]}],"authkeywords":"Camera calibration | Error tracing | Large Field of View(FOV) | Stereo vision measurement | Virtual stereo target","source-id":"144897","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
