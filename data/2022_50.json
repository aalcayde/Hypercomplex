However, with the increasing depth and complexity of network models, the number of calculated parameters also increases, which means the training of most high-performance models depends on large-scale samples and expensive equipment. Therefore, the key to the current research is to realize a lightweight model while ensuring the recognition accuracy. At present, PCANet, a typical lightweight framework for deep learning, has achieved good results in most of the image recognition tasks, but its recognition accuracy for color face images, especially under occlusion, still needs to be improved. Therefore, a color occlusion face recognition method based on quaternion non-convex sparse constraint mechanism is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a quaternion non-convex sparse principal component analysis network model was constructed based on Lp regularization of strong sparsity. Secondly, the fixed point iteration method and coordinate descent method were established to solve the non-convex optimization problem. Finally, the occlusion recognition performance of the proposed method was verified on Georgia Tech, Color FERET, AR, and LFW-A Color face datasets.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104687","afid":"60104687","affilname":"Guangdong University of Petrochemical Technology","affiliation-city":"Maoming","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013614","afid":"60013614","affilname":"Hangzhou Dianzi University","affiliation-city":"Hangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"35890964","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55967624600","authid":"55967624600","authname":"Wen C.","surname":"Wen","given-name":"Chenglin","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104687"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222003449","authid":"57222003449","authname":"Qiu Y.","surname":"Qiu","given-name":"Yiting","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013614"}]}],"authkeywords":"coordinate descent | fixed point iterative | Lp non-convex sparse | occluded color face | PCANet","article-number":"5284","source-id":"130124","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61733009","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85135110367"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85135110367?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85135110367&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85135110367&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85135110367","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85135110367","eid":"2-s2.0-85135110367","dc:title":"Crosstalk Defect Detection Method Based on Salient Color Channel Frequency Domain Filtering","dc:creator":"Xie W.","prism:publicationName":"Sensors","prism:issn":"14248220","prism:volume":"22","prism:issueIdentifier":"14","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2022","prism:doi":"10.3390/s22145426","dc:description":"Display crosstalk defect detection is an important link in the display quality inspection process.

Secondly, the image color quaternion matrix is converted into the logarithmic spectrum in the frequency domain through the hyper-complex Fourier transform. Finally, Gaussian threshold band-pass filtering and hyper-complex inverse Fourier transform are used to separate the low-contrast defects and background of the display image. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the proposed algorithm reaches 96% for a variety of crosstalk defect detection.

QMPDFrAT is first defined and then applied to encrypt multiple color images. In the designed algorithm, the low-frequency and high-frequency sub-bands of the three color components of each plaintext image are obtained by two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform. Then, the high-frequency sub-bands are further made sparse and the main features of these sub-bands are extracted by a Zigzag scan. Subsequently, all the low-frequency sub-bands and high-frequency fusion images are represented as three quaternion signals, which are modulated by the proposed QMPDFrAT with three quaternion random phase masks, respectively. The spherical transform, as a nonlinear operation, is followed to nonlinearly make the three transform results interact. For better security, a joint permutation-diffusion mechanism based on plaintext-related random pixel insertion is performed on the three intermediate outputs to yield the final encryption image. Compared with many similar color image compression-encryption schemes, the proposed algorithm can encrypt double-color-image with higher quality of image reconstruction. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed double-color-image encryption algorithm is feasibility and achieves high security.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025256","afid":"60025256","affilname":"Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010606","afid":"60010606","affilname":"East China Jiaotong University","affiliation-city":"Nanchang","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008332","afid":"60008332","affilname":"Nanchang University","affiliation-city":"Nanchang","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16178672300","authid":"16178672300","authname":"Xiao M.","surname":"Xiao","given-name":"Meihua","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010606"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57798499500","authid":"57798499500","authname":"Tan R.","surname":"Tan","given-name":"Ruixiao","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010606"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216847190","authid":"57216847190","authname":"Ye H.","surname":"Ye","given-name":"Huosheng","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008332"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/21739408600","authid":"21739408600","authname":"Gong L.","surname":"Gong","given-name":"Lihua","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008332"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57213268188","authid":"57213268188","authname":"Zhu Z.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Zhiliang","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010606"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025256"}]}],"authkeywords":"double-color-image encryption | non-adjacent coupled map lattices | quaternion | random pixel insertion","article-number":"941","source-id":"13715","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"20181BBE58022","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85133572921"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85133572921?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85133572921&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85133572921&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85133572921","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85133572921","eid":"2-s2.0-85133572921","dc:title":"Solving Quaternion Linear System Based on Semi-Tensor Product of Quaternion Matrices","dc:creator":"Fan X.","prism:publicationName":"Symmetry","prism:eIssn":"20738994","prism:volume":"14","prism:issueIdentifier":"7","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2022","prism:doi":"10.3390/sym14071359","dc:description":"In this paper, we use semi-tensor product of quaternion matrices, L-representation of quaternion matrices, and GH-representation of special quaternion matrices such as quaternion (anti)centrosymmetric matrices to solve the special solutions of quaternion matrix equation.

The algorithm in this paper is also applied in a centrosymmetric color digital image restoration model.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030274","afid":"60030274","affilname":"Liaocheng University","affiliation-city":"Liaocheng","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/124953169","afid":"124953169","affilname":"Research Center of Semi-tensor Product of Matrices: Theory and Applications","affiliation-city":"Liaocheng","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57729583800","authid":"57729583800","authname":"Fan X.","surname":"Fan","given-name":"Xueling","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030274"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"124953169"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56086640300","authid":"56086640300","authname":"Li Y.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Ying","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030274"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"124953169"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57357730100","authid":"57357730100","authname":"Liu Z.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Zhihong","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030274"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"124953169"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36867981700","authid":"36867981700","authname":"Zhao J.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Jianli","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030274"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"124953169"}]}],"authkeywords":"(anti)-centrosymmetric matrix | GH-representation | L-representation | quaternion matrix equation | semi-tensor product of quaternion matrices","article-number":"1359","source-id":"21100201542","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"62176112","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85126878316"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85126878316?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85126878316&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85126878316&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85126878316","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85126878316","eid":"2-s2.0-85126878316","dc:title":"Helmet-fourier orthogonal moments for image representation and recognition","dc:creator":"Hjouji A.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Supercomputing","prism:issn":"09208542","prism:eIssn":"15730484","prism:volume":"78","prism:issueIdentifier":"11","prism:pageRange":"13583-13623","prism:coverDate":"2022-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2022","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11227-022-04414-6","dc:description":"The orthogonal moments have recently achieved outstanding predictive performance and become an indispensable tool in a wide range of imaging and pattern recognition applications, including image reconstruction, image classification and object detection.

A primary motivation for investigating quaternion algebras is to extend the classical signal processing to quaternion signal processing theory. However, this algebra has non-commutative multiplication, leading to the uncertainty of such essential operations as the convolution and Fourier transform. As a result, it became difficult to process quaternion signals in the frequency domain. In this work, the arithmetic of quaternion numbers is analyzed using the Cayley-Dickson construction, but with an associative and commutative operation of multiplication. We call it the (2,2)-model of quaternions. This model's main properties of quaternions are described, including inverse, division, and conjugate operations. In the (2,2)-model, only two exponential functions with pure quaternion units exit, and therefore, only two types of the quaternion discrete Fourier transform (QDFT) can be defined. One of the crucial benefits of this model is that the unique definition of convolution will help reduce the complexity of quaternion convolution operation calculated using both types of QDFTs.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010187","afid":"60010187","affilname":"College of Staten Island","affiliation-city":"New York","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003212","afid":"60003212","affilname":"The University of Texas at San Antonio","affiliation-city":"San Antonio","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006123399","authid":"7006123399","authname":"Grigoryan A.M.","surname":"Grigoryan","given-name":"Artyom M.","initials":"A.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003212"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003395533","authid":"7003395533","authname":"Agaian S.S.","surname":"Agaian","given-name":"Sos S.","initials":"S.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010187"}]}],"authkeywords":"Quaternion convolution | Quaternion Fourier transform | Quaternion signal processing","article-number":"108533","source-id":"25548","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85122757238"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85122757238?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85122757238&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85122757238&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85122757238","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85122757238","eid":"2-s2.0-85122757238","dc:title":"Convolution and correlation theorems for Wigner–Ville distribution associated with the quaternion offset linear canonical transform: Convolution and correlation theorems for WVD associated with the QOLCT","dc:creator":"Bhat M.Y.","prism:publicationName":"Signal, Image and Video Processing","prism:issn":"18631703","prism:eIssn":"18631711","prism:volume":"16","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"1235-1242","prism:coverDate":"2022-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2022","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11760-021-02074-2","dc:description":"The quaternion offset linear canonical transform (QOLCT) has gained much popularity in recent years because of its applications in many areas, including image and signal processing.

Firstly, we propose the definition of the WVD-QOLCT, and then, several important properties of newly defined WVD-QOLCT, such as reconstruction formula, orthogonality relation, are derived. Secondly, a novel canonical convolution operator and a related correlation operator for WVD-QOLCT are proposed.

The analysis of a quaternion wavelet shows that the amplitude image of the quaternion wavelet is easily affected by noise. However, the three phase images, which mainly reflect edge and texture information, are randomly and disorderly distributed with respect to noise. The QWT denoising algorithm is suitable for processing sinusoidal fringe images of complex structures in a high-accuracy 3D measurement system. Sinusoidal fringe images are collected and denoised by using the QWT algorithm and classical Gaussian smoothing (GS) denoising algorithm, and GS is used as a reference for the QWT algorithm. The results indicate that the standard deviation is reduced from 0.1448 for raw sinusoidal fringe images to 0.0192, and the signal-to-noise ratio is improved from 4.6213 dB to 13.3463 dB by using the QWT algorithm. The two algorithms have the same denoising effect for a surface with less information. For a surface with rich information, the details of the 3D contour are lost because of the image “blurring” caused by using the GS algorithm, while all edge details of the 3D contour are reconstructed by using the QWT denoising algorithm because of its characteristic of information and noise being separated from the source. For the measured face mask, the error is less than ±0.02 mm. In addition, it takes less than 20 s to run the QWT algorithm to process eight sinusoidal fringe images, which meets the requirements of high-precision measurements.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016930","afid":"60016930","affilname":"Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57224110685","authid":"57224110685","authname":"Fan L.","surname":"Fan","given-name":"Lei","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016930"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55733886200","authid":"55733886200","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yongjun","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016930"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7409198364","authid":"7409198364","authname":"Zhang H.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Hongxin","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016930"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204644301","authid":"57204644301","authname":"Li C.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Chao","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016930"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102700839","authid":"7102700839","authname":"Xin X.","surname":"Xin","given-name":"Xiangjun","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016930"}]}],"authkeywords":"3D profile measurement | image denoising | quaternion wavelet transform","article-number":"1807","source-id":"21100829272","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"62075014","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85128022551"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85128022551?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85128022551&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85128022551&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85128022551","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85128022551","eid":"2-s2.0-85128022551","dc:title":"Fast Quaternion Log-Polar Radial Harmonic Fourier Moments for Color Image Zero-Watermarking","dc:creator":"Niu P.P.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision","prism:issn":"09249907","prism:eIssn":"15737683","prism:volume":"64","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"537-568","prism:coverDate":"2022-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2022","prism:doi":"10.1007/s10851-022-01084-0","dc:description":"As a copyright protection technology, zero-watermarking has received widespread attention in recent years. The zero-watermarking algorithm based on moments has been extensively studied due to its better comprehensive performance and has made great progress. However, three issues of the moments-based zero-watermarking methods should be addressed: first, most of them ignore the analysis and experiment on discriminability, which leads to the high false positive ratio; second, direct computation of the moments from their definition is inefficient, numerically unstable and inaccurate, which severely affects the performances of these moments-based methods; third, most of the algorithms are only suitable for grayscale images, which leads to the limitation of the algorithms in practical applications. In this paper, we present a new color image zero-watermarking using fast quaternion log-polar radial harmonic Fourier moments. This algorithm firstly introduces log-polar coordinates to make traditional RHFMs scale-invariant, secondly improves their speed and accuracy, then introduces the concept of quaternion to make it suitable for color images, and finally applies it to the zero-watermark technology. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that compared to the existing algorithms, the BER value of the proposed algorithm is 0 under some attacks, which can prove its effectiveness and achieved a good trade-off between discriminability and robustness, and has certain superiority in terms of security, capacity and speed.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017010","afid":"60017010","affilname":"Liaoning Normal University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16205443400","authid":"16205443400","authname":"Niu P.P.","surname":"Niu","given-name":"Pan Pan","initials":"P.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209282355","authid":"57209282355","authname":"Wang L.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Li","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57486306000","authid":"57486306000","authname":"Wang F.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Fei","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972350300","authid":"34972350300","authname":"Yang H.Y.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Hong Ying","initials":"H.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972239800","authid":"34972239800","authname":"Wang X.Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiang Yang","initials":"X.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]}],"authkeywords":"Fast pseudo-polar Fourier transform | Frequency domain interpolation | Quaternion | Radial harmonic Fourier moments | Zero-watermarking","source-id":"28501","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61472171","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85127404213"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85127404213?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85127404213&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85127404213&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85127404213","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85127404213","eid":"2-s2.0-85127404213","dc:title":"An anti-vibration-shock inertial matching measurement method for hull deformation","dc:creator":"Xu D.","prism:publicationName":"IET Signal Processing","prism:issn":"17519675","prism:eIssn":"17519683","prism:volume":"16","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"490-500","prism:coverDate":"2022-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2022","prism:doi":"10.1049/sil2.12122","dc:description":"In order to establish a unified spatial reference for the whole ship, inertial matching measurement of hull deformation is widely used because of its continuity and concealment. However, the vibration-shock signal of shipborne equipment often brings short-time output disturbance to the user-side fibre gyroscope unit (FGU), and the disturbance will bring great challenges to the accuracy and convergence of inertial matching measurement. To solve these problems, the authors put forward a new algorithm named as attitude quaternion matching method-improved double factor adaptive Kalman filter-parameter adaptive Kalman filter (AQM-IDFAKF-PAKF). (1) The AQM established the FGU attitude as observation to build the basic model for hull deformation inertial matching method. (2) The authors introduced IDFAKF to track the trend of dynamic hull deformation in vibration interference by using historical data. (3) After judging the anti-vibration-shock calculation stop node, PAKF was utilised to adaptively adjust the parameters of hull deformation matching after vibration-shock, so as to quickly calculate the static hull deformation angle after shock interference. Numerical simulation results illustrated that the AQM-IDFAKF-PAKF can quickly converge the calculation of hull deformation angle with a small steady-state error under the condition of vibration-shock signal interference.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018205","afid":"60018205","affilname":"Xiamen University","affiliation-city":"Xiamen","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017161","afid":"60017161","affilname":"National University of Singapore","affiliation-city":"Singapore City","affiliation-country":"Singapore"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013789","afid":"60013789","affilname":"Beihang University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57224870850","authid":"57224870850","orcid":"0000-0002-7467-0387","authname":"Xu D.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Dongsheng","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018205"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017161"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192504350","authid":"57192504350","authname":"Zhang X.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xiaoli","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018205"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23111361200","authid":"23111361200","authname":"Peng X.","surname":"Peng","given-name":"Xiafu","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018205"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14012244000","authid":"14012244000","authname":"Yang G.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Gongliu","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013789"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221692287","authid":"57221692287","authname":"Chen J.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Jinwen","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018205"}]}],"authkeywords":"adaptive Kalman filters | adaptive signal processing | inertial navigation | optical sensors | random noise | signal processing","source-id":"6100153106","fund-acr":"NUS","fund-no":"20720190129","fund-sponsor":"National University of Singapore","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85114732729"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85114732729?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85114732729&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85114732729&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85114732729","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85114732729","eid":"2-s2.0-85114732729","dc:title":"Detecting Aligned Double JPEG Compressed Color Image With Same Quantization Matrix Based on the Stability of Image","dc:creator":"Wang H.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","prism:issn":"10518215","prism:eIssn":"15582205","prism:volume":"32","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"4065-4080","prism:coverDate":"2022-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 June 2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2021.3111195","dc:description":"Joint photographic experts group (JPEG) compression is widely used in image processing and computer vision. Detecting double compressed JPEG images is a common problem in forensics and detecting compressed images with the same quantization matrix remains a challenging task. However, most existing methods were designed for detection in grayscale images and cannot fully use the unique characteristics of color images (such as the relationship between channels and color information). In addition, the performance of existing methods is unsatisfactory for low JPEG quality factors and in cross detection experiments. To solve these problems, we analyze the stability of a color image to obtain the convergence error and transposition error. According to the convergence characteristics of color JPEG images, the continuous compression by the same quantization matrix can make the JPEG image tend to be stable. The final stable state and the convergence process are determined by the number of compressions of the original image. Thus, continuously compressed JPEG images can be regarded as a continuous frame to obtain the convergence error. As the color image converges, its ability to resist interference decreases. To reflect the changes in anti-interference ability, the transposition operation is used to disturb the color JPEG image to obtain the transposition error. In addition, quaternion mapping is used to retain the relationship between continuously compressed JPEG images and enlarge the influence caused by transposition operation. In our experiments on several image databases, the proposed method outperforms existing methods in different settings.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true",

control action if partial or complete failure of the vision system in the short term occurs. Moreover, the autonomous robotic system takes physical and operational constraints into account to perform the demands of a specific visual servoing task in a way to minimize a cost function. A hierarchical control architecture is developed based on interwoven integration of a variant of the iterative closest point image registration, a constrained noise-adaptive Kalman filter, a fault detection logic and recovery system, together with a constrained optimal path planner. The dynamic estimator estimates unknown states and uncertain parameters required for motion prediction while imposing a set of inequality constraints for consistency of the estimation process and adjusting adaptively the Kalman filter parameters in the face of unexpected vision errors. It is followed by the implementation of a fault recovery strategy based on a fault detection logic that monitors the health of the visual feedback using the metric fit error of the image registration. Subsequently, the estimated/predicted pose and parameters are passed to an optimal path planner in order to bring the robot end-effector to the grasping point of a moving target as quickly as possible subject to multiple constraints, such as acceleration limit, smooth capture, and line-of-sight angle of the target. Experimental results demonstrated such a visual servoing system succeeded to capture a free-floating object despite the complete failure of the vision system due to occlusion in the last 10 s prior to approach and capture operation.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007248","afid":"60007248","affilname":"Canadian Space Agency","affiliation-city":"Longueuil","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003923445","authid":"7003923445","orcid":"0000-0002-2059-0226","authname":"Aghili F.","surname":"Aghili","given-name":"Farhad","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007248"}]}],"authkeywords":"3D image processing | fault detection and recovery | robot vision | visual servoing","source-id":"19113","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85110812283"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85110812283?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85110812283&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85110812283&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85110812283","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85110812283","eid":"2-s2.0-85110812283","dc:title":"Quaternion Matrix Optimization: Motivation and Analysis","dc:creator":"Qi L.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications","prism:issn":"00223239","prism:eIssn":"15732878","prism:volume":"193","prism:issueIdentifier":"1-3","prism:pageRange":"621-648","prism:coverDate":"2022-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2022","prism:doi":"10.1007/s10957-021-01906-y","dc:description":"The class of quaternion matrix optimization (QMO) problems, with quaternion matrices as decision variables, has been widely used in color image processing and other engineering areas in recent years. However, optimization theory for QMO is far from adequate. The main objective of this paper is to provide necessary theoretical foundations on optimality analysis, in order to enrich the contents of optimization theory and to pave way for the design of efficient numerical algorithms as well. We achieve this goal by conducting a thorough study on the first-order and second-order (sub)differentiation of real-valued functions in quaternion matrices, with a newly introduced operation called R-product as the key tool for our calculus. Combining with the classical optimization theory, we establish the first-order and the second-order optimality analysis for QMO. Particular treatments on convex functions, the ℓ-norm and the rank function in quaternion matrices are tailored for a sparse low rank QMO model, arising from color image denoising, to establish its optimality conditions via stationarity.","citedby-count":"17","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023813","afid":"60023813","affilname":"Shanghai University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022381","afid":"60022381","affilname":"Beijing Jiaotong University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019533","afid":"60019533","affilname":"Tianjin University","affiliation-city":"Tianjin","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013614","afid":"60013614","affilname":"Hangzhou Dianzi University","affiliation-city":"Hangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55670710000","authid":"55670710000","orcid":"0000-0002-1112-5250","authname":"Qi L.","surname":"Qi","given-name":"Liqun","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013614"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/27067854000","authid":"27067854000","authname":"Luo Z.","surname":"Luo","given-name":"Ziyan","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022381"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55780759900","authid":"55780759900","authname":"Wang Q.W.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Qing Wen","initials":"Q.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8834497200","authid":"8834497200","authname":"Zhang X.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xinzhen","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019533"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image processing | Generalized subdifferentials | Quaternion matrix variables | Real-valued functions | Subdifferentials","source-id":"23966","fund-acr":"NNSFC, NNSF, NSF, NSFC","fund-no":"11771038","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85108947782"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85108947782?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85108947782&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85108947782&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0019057821003359"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85108947782","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85108947782","eid":"2-s2.0-85108947782","dc:title":"Geometric resistant polar quaternion discrete Fourier transform and its application in color image zero-hiding","dc:creator":"Wang C.","prism:publicationName":"ISA Transactions","prism:issn":"00190578","prism:volume":"125","prism:pageRange":"665-680","prism:coverDate":"2022-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2022","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.isatra.2021.06.019","pii":"S0019057821003359","dc:description":"As a typical frequency-domain analysis method, quaternion discrete Fourier transform (QDFT) has been widely used in information hiding in color images.

When the fault location differs from the sensor direction by 180°, the fault information in the signal is weak and may be masked by noise. Multi-channel signal acquisition is one of the methods to solve the problem. Although existing algorithms can extract fault information from a single-channel signal, they are inefficient and sometimes fail to extract weak fault information. Therefore, the information in each channel needs to be associated and combined in advance. This paper proposes a multi-channel signal processing method called quaternion empirical wavelet transform (QEWT). QEWT based on the quaternion Fourier transform can process multiple groups of vibration signals at the same time, which realizes synchronous spectral division, fusion and modal decomposition. The modal separation method based on spectral trend avoids the problems of modal aliasing and low efficiency of scale-space representation. The proposed method combines spectral negentropy with the identification of the fault characteristics of the outer ring and the inner ring, and successfully realizes the fault diagnosis of the rolling bearing.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022281","afid":"60022281","affilname":"Beijing University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018873","afid":"60018873","affilname":"Mie University","affiliation-city":"Tsu","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188993058","authid":"57188993058","authname":"Zhang K.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Kun","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018873"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216873857","authid":"57216873857","authname":"Deng Y.","surname":"Deng","given-name":"Yunjie","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022281"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194439449","authid":"57194439449","authname":"Chen P.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Peng","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018873"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56102740500","authid":"56102740500","authname":"Ma C.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Chaoyong","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018873"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12784466700","authid":"12784466700","authname":"Xu Y.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Yonggang","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022281"}]}],"authkeywords":"Fault diagnosis | Feature identification | Multi-channel signal | Quaternion empirical wavelet transform | Rolling bearing","article-number":"111179","source-id":"15424","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"51775005","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85130502768"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85130502768?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85130502768&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85130502768&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85130502768","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85130502768","eid":"2-s2.0-85130502768","dc:title":"GAN-Generated Face Detection with Strong Generalization Ability Based on Quaternions","dc:creator":"Chen B.","prism:publicationName":"Jisuanji Fuzhu Sheji Yu Tuxingxue Xuebao/Journal of Computer-Aided Design and Computer Graphics","prism:issn":"10039775","prism:volume":"34","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"734-742","prism:coverDate":"2022-05-20","prism:coverDisplayDate":"20 May 2022","prism:doi":"10.3724/SP.J.1089.2022.19015","dc:description":"Models based on generative adversarial network (GAN) can generate very realistic face images, which bring additional challenges to justice, criminal investigation and reputation protection, etc. Therefore, a GAN-generated face detection algorithm having a strong generalization ability is proposed by using quaternions. The algorithm consists of a GAN noise fingerprint extraction module and a classification module. The former module uses Siamese quaternion U-Net to extract fingerprint features. The latter module adopts quaternion ResNet to distinguish the natural face from the GAN-generated face based on the extracted fingerprint features. In addition, the distance based logistic loss and cross entropy loss are used to optimize parameters. Experiments are based on a public natural face dataset CelebA, and some generated face datasets that generated by various GANs trained on the CelebA. Four groups of ablation experiments verify the improvements of the proposed algorithm in four aspects. The experiments, in which training data generated by only one kind of GAN but testing data by multiple GANs, show that the proposed algorithm has stronger generalization ability than the existing algorithms.

Smoke, uneven lighting, and color deviation are common issues in endoscopic surgery, which have increased the risk of surgery and even lead to failure. Approach. In this study, we present a new physics model driven semi-supervised learning framework for high-quality pixel-wise endoscopic image enhancement, which is generalizable for smoke removal, light adjustment, and color correction. To improve the authenticity of the generated images, and thereby improve the network performance, we integrated specific physical imaging defect models with the CycleGAN framework. No ground-truth data in pairs are required. In addition, we propose a transfer learning framework to address the data scarcity in several endoscope enhancement tasks and improve the network performance. Main results. Qualitative and quantitative studies reveal that the proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art image enhancement methods. In particular, the proposed method performs much better than the original CycleGAN, for example, the structural similarity improved from 0.7925 to 0.8648, feature similarity for color images from 0.8917 to 0.9283, and quaternion structural similarity from 0.8097 to 0.8800 in the smoke removal task. Experimental results of the proposed transfer learning method also reveal its superior performance when trained with small datasets of target tasks. Significance. Experimental results on endoscopic images prove the effectiveness of the proposed network in smoke removal, light adjustment, and color correction, showing excellent clinical usefulness.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016835","afid":"60016835","affilname":"Beijing Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"35417895","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "9", "$" :"9"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195552632","authid":"57195552632","authname":"Li W.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Wenjie","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56028732500","authid":"56028732500","authname":"Fan J.","surname":"Fan","given-name":"Jingfan","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211479424","authid":"57211479424","authname":"Li Y.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Yating","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57215192206","authid":"57215192206","authname":"Hao P.","surname":"Hao","given-name":"Pengcheng","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57212110354","authid":"57212110354","authname":"Lin Y.","surname":"Lin","given-name":"Yucong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56365895900","authid":"56365895900","authname":"Fu T.","surname":"Fu","given-name":"Tianyu","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56173394200","authid":"56173394200","authname":"Ai D.","surname":"Ai","given-name":"Danni","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "8", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404037613","authid":"7404037613","authname":"Song H.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Hong","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "9", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57091071100","authid":"57091071100","authname":"Yang J.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Jian","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]}],"authkeywords":"cycle-consistent adversarial network | endoscopy image enhancement | imaging defect model | semi-supervised training","article-number":"095016","source-id":"29203","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61901031","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85134031097"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85134031097?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85134031097&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85134031097&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85134031097","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85134031097","eid":"2-s2.0-85134031097","dc:title":"Visual Localization Based on Deep Learning ⎯ Take Southern Branch of the National Palace Museum for Example","dc:creator":"Tu C.H.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of the Chinese Institute of Civil and Hydraulic Engineering","prism:issn":"10155856","prism:volume":"34","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"215-220","prism:coverDate":"2022-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May 2022","prism:doi":"10.6652/JoCICHE.202205_34(3).0004","dc:description":"Visual localization uses images to regress camera position and orientation. It has many applications in computer vision such as autonomous driving, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), and so on. The convolutional neural network simulates biological vision and has a good image feature extraction ability, so using it in visual localization can improve regression accuracy. Although our team has built an image indoor localization model for Southern Branch of the National Palace Museum, this paper tries to use new network and loss function to achieve better positioning accuracy. In this paper, we use ResNet-50 as backbone network, and change the output layer to 3-dimensional position and 4-dimensional orientation quaternion, and use learnable weights loss function. We compare different pretrained models and normalization methods, and the best result improves the positioning accuracy by about 60%.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014982","afid":"60014982","affilname":"National Cheng Kung University","affiliation-city":"Tainan","affiliation-country":"Taiwan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55295307100","authid":"55295307100","authname":"Tu C.H.","surname":"Tu","given-name":"Chia Hao","initials":"C.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014982"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14632400300","authid":"14632400300","authname":"Lu E.H.C.","surname":"Lu","given-name":"Eric Hsueh Chan","initials":"E.H.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014982"}]}],"authkeywords":"Convolutional neural network | Deep learning | Visual localization","source-id":"6300153124","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
