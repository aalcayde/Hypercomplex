Exposure Fusion, specifically, fuses a bracketed exposure stack of poorly lit images to generate a properly illuminated image. Given a single input image, exposure fusion can still be employed on a gsimulated' exposure stack, leading to direct single image contrast and low-light enhancement. In this work, we present a novel gQuaternion Factorized Simulated Exposure Fusion' (QFSEF) method by factorizing an input image into multiple illumination consistent layers. To this end, we use an iterative sparse matrix factorization scheme by representing the image as a two-dimensional pure quaternion matrix. Theoretically, our representation is based on the dichromatic reflection model and accounts for the two scene illumination characteristics by factorizing each progressively generated image into separate specular and diffuse components. We empirically prove the advantages of our factorization scheme over other exposure simulation methods by using it for the low-light image enhancement task. Furthermore, we provide three exposure fusion strategies which can be used with our simulated stack and provide a comprehensive performance analysis. Finally, in order to validate our claims, we show extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons against relevant state-of-the-art solutions on multiple standard datasets along with relevant ablation analysis to support our proposition.

The rotational attitude estimation of the non-cooperative space object is realized by matching the feature points of adjacent frame images, and the conditions required for translational estimation are discussed. This method has small calculation costs and runs stably, which meets the requirements of real-time computation on-board. As a result, this method implements the estimation of the complete unknown information of the object, including the attitude quaternion and angular velocity.

In view of these problems, a lidar point cloud descriptor with rotation and translation invariance in an urban dynamic environment is proposed. Firstly, in terms of point cloud processing, a ground point segmentation algorithm based on angular images is used to remove ground points in point cloud data, and a dynamic target elimination algorithm based on curved voxel clustering is adopted to realize point cloud segmentation and remove dynamic targets. Secondly, Coordinate system transformation of point clouds are carried out based on quaternions collected by an inertial measurement unit, and the point clouds in all frames are unified under the same heading angle, so as to realize the rotation invariance of the descriptor. In addition, the relative position relationship between the static targets in the point clouds and the normal plane where the moving direction of the carrier is located is used to determine the rendering center of the descriptor, so as to realize the translation invariance of the descriptor. Finally, the proposed descriptor is used for closed-loop detection, and the consistency of the closed-loop detection results is verified according to the spatial structure of the point cloud data. The experimental results under the KITTI public dataset show that the proposed method can achieve closed-loop detection more quickly and accurately in an urban dynamic environment. Compared with that of the ISC algorithm, the recall rate of the proposed method is improved by 8. 58 percentage points at an accuracy of 100%, and the average time consumption is reduced by 12.90%.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60082200","afid":"60082200","affilname":"Shanghai Dianji University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58028387500","authid":"58028387500","authname":"Chang Y.","surname":"Chang","given-name":"Yaohui","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60082200"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202084859","authid":"57202084859","authname":"Chen N.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Niansheng","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60082200"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57045375700","authid":"57045375700","authname":"Rao L.","surname":"Rao","given-name":"Lei","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60082200"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58028133900","authid":"58028133900","authname":"Cheng S.","surname":"Cheng","given-name":"Songlin","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60082200"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36109885900","authid":"36109885900","authname":"Fan G.","surname":"Fan","given-name":"Guangyu","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60082200"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36728430600","authid":"36728430600","authname":"Song X.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Xiaoyong","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60082200"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56138675600","authid":"56138675600","authname":"Yang D.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Dingyu","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60082200"}]}],"authkeywords":"atmospheric optics | closed- loop detection | inertial measurement unit | lidar | rotation invariance | translation invariance","article-number":"2401007","source-id":"29717","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85144097505"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85144097505?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85144097505&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85144097505&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85144097505","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85144097505","eid":"2-s2.0-85144097505","dc:title":"Adaptable physics-based super-resolution for electron backscatter diffraction maps","dc:creator":"Jangid D.K.","prism:publicationName":"npj Computational Materials","prism:eIssn":"20573960","prism:volume":"8","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2022","prism:doi":"10.1038/s41524-022-00924-2","dc:description":"In computer vision, single-image super-resolution (SISR) has been extensively explored using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on optical images, but images outside this domain, such as those from scientific experiments, are not well investigated. Experimental data is often gathered using non-optical methods, which alters the metrics for image quality. One such example is electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), a materials characterization technique that maps crystal arrangement in solid materials, which provides insight into processing, structure, and property relationships. We present a broadly adaptable approach for applying state-of-art SISR networks to generate super-resolved EBSD orientation maps. This approach includes quaternion-based orientation recognition, loss functions that consider rotational effects and crystallographic symmetry, and an inference pipeline to convert network output into established visualization formats for EBSD maps. The ability to generate physically accurate, high-resolution EBSD maps with super-resolution enables high-throughput characterization and broadens the capture capabilities for three-dimensional experimental EBSD datasets.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029241","afid":"60029241","affilname":"University of California, Santa Barbara","affiliation-city":"Santa Barbara","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "9", "$" :"9"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219789846","authid":"57219789846","orcid":"0000-0002-8852-0670","authname":"Jangid D.K.","surname":"Jangid","given-name":"Devendra K.","initials":"D.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029241"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188683710","authid":"57188683710","orcid":"0000-0002-4426-5997","authname":"Brodnik N.R.","surname":"Brodnik","given-name":"Neal R.","initials":"N.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029241"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57212003553","authid":"57212003553","authname":"Goebel M.G.","surname":"Goebel","given-name":"Michael G.","initials":"M.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029241"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211965622","authid":"57211965622","authname":"Khan A.","surname":"Khan","given-name":"Amil","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029241"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58019140800","authid":"58019140800","authname":"Majeti S.S.","surname":"Majeti","given-name":"Sai Sidharth","initials":"S.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029241"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/39961287000","authid":"39961287000","orcid":"0000-0003-4107-0366","authname":"Echlin M.L.P.","surname":"Echlin","given-name":"McLean L.P.","initials":"M.L.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029241"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57988031100","authid":"57988031100","orcid":"0000-0002-7297-1696","authname":"Daly S.H.","surname":"Daly","given-name":"Samantha H.","initials":"S.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029241"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "8", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102609090","authid":"7102609090","authname":"Pollock T.M.","surname":"Pollock","given-name":"Tresa M.","initials":"T.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029241"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "9", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35550721300","authid":"35550721300","orcid":"0000-0003-2804-3611","authname":"Manjunath B.S.","surname":"Manjunath","given-name":"B.

It relies on the idea of transforming the original functional data into an infinite series representation by projection onto an specific RKHS, which usually simplifies the statistical treatment without any loss of efficiency. Moreover, the advantages of quaternion algebra over real-valued three and four-dimensional vector algebra in the modelling of multidimensional data have been proven useful in much relatively recent research. This paper accordingly proposes a generic RKHS framework for the statistical analysis of augmented quaternion random vectors, which provide a complete description of their second order characteristics. It will allow us to exploit the full advantages of the RKHS theory in widely linear processing applications, such as signal detection. In particular, we address the detection of a quaternion signal disturbed by additive Gaussian noise and the discrimination between two quaternion Gaussian signals in continuous time.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014586","afid":"60014586","affilname":"Universidad de Jaén","affiliation-city":"Jaen","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101747848","authid":"7101747848","orcid":"0000-0001-6203-7341","authname":"Oya A.","surname":"Oya","given-name":"Antonia","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014586"}]}],"authkeywords":"detection problem | quaternion random signal | reproducing kernel Hilbert space | widely linear processing","article-number":"4432","source-id":"21100830702","fund-acr":"FEDER","fund-no":"1256911","fund-sponsor":"Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85142507067"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85142507067?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85142507067&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85142507067&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0167865522003099"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85142507067","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85142507067","eid":"2-s2.0-85142507067","dc:title":"A fixed-point rotation-based feature selection method for micro-expression recognition","dc:creator":"Wang M.","prism:publicationName":"Pattern Recognition Letters","prism:issn":"01678655","prism:volume":"164","prism:pageRange":"261-267","prism:coverDate":"2022-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2022","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.patrec.2022.10.021","pii":"S0167865522003099","dc:description":"Micro-expressions (MEs) express spontaneous, subtle, and hard to hide real human emotions. Compared with macro expressions, the occurrence of MEs is characterized by a small number of activated muscles, short duration, and low amplitude of action. Therefore, extracting the sparse spatio-temporal features of MEs is a challenge for ME recognition. In this paper, we try to extract the low-dimensional features of MEs while ensuring a high accuracy. Firstly, considering that ME samples may be inconsistent in the time domain, a differential energy image method is improved to fix the temporal variation of MEs to unit time. An integral projection method is then used to improve the information density. Secondly, a fixed-point rotation-based feature selection method is proposed further select features with large motion variations. Specifically, the features are transformed from RGB to rotation axes in 3D space, and a fixed point is rotated separately to form a point set. The relative position of the points is changed by adjusting the rotation angle thus optimizing the distribution of the point set. The subset of points with large rotation angles is selected as the feature for classification. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is evaluated using SVM as a classifier experimented on three datasets. The experimental results show that the low-dimensional features can perform well for ME recognition.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002836","afid":"60002836","affilname":"Hefei University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Hefei","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57979813200","authid":"57979813200","authname":"Wang M.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Mingzhong","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002836"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194435359","authid":"57194435359","authname":"Wang Q.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Qi","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002836"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9942016100","authid":"9942016100","authname":"Wang Q.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Qingshan","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002836"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57457573900","authid":"57457573900","authname":"Zheng Z.","surname":"Zheng","given-name":"Zhiwen","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002836"}]}],"authkeywords":"Differential energy image | Feature selection | Fixed-point rotation | Integral projection | Micro-expression recognition | Quaternion","source-id":"24825","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61571179","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85141310062"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85141310062?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85141310062&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85141310062&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2214212622002125"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85141310062","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85141310062","eid":"2-s2.0-85141310062","dc:title":"Quaternion with quantum walks for designing a novel color image cryptosystem","dc:creator":"Abd-El-Atty B.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Information Security and Applications","prism:issn":"22142134","prism:eIssn":"22142126","prism:volume":"71","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2022","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jisa.2022.103367","pii":"S2214212622002125","dc:description":"Data confidentiality plays a paramount part in our everyday lives. While most modern cryptosystems perform skillfully on digital resources, the rapid development of quantum resources may provide sufficient capability in the near future to hack most current cryptosystems because their construction is mathematical model-based. Although quantum algorithms will not be effective until quantum computers are physically realized and have sufficient capability to outperform digital computation, new cryptosystems are required to be designed using quantum technologies and have the capability to be implemented in both digital and quantum resources besides resisting the probable attacks from those resources. Quantum walk is a computational paradigm that can be implemented as a quantum-inspired paradigm and serves as a chaotic dynamical model employed for developing modern cryptosystems. This work presented a new color image cryptosystem using quaternion, quantum walks, and logistic-sine map. The aim of utilizing quaternion is to increase the key space of the presented cryptosystem, in addition to integrating the sequence originating from the logistic-sine map with the probability distribution originating from quantum walks for generating inseparable chaotic sequences utilized in the permutation and substitution phases of the presented image cryptosystem.

By estimating the 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) displacement of structures, structural behavior can be monitored directly. Therefore, this study aims to develop a translational and rotational displacement estimation method by fusing a vision sensor and inertial measurement unit (IMU) using a quaternion-based iterative extended Kalman filter (QIEKF). The QIEKF algorithm was applied to reduce the nonlinear influence on the measurement model. The 6-DOF displacement is predicted using the integral of the gyroscope output and updated via a combination of an accelerometer and a magnetometer through a vector matching process in the Kalman filter framework. Subsequently, the 6-DOF displacement estimation result is updated through a vision sensor using a 2-D planar marker and homography transformation in the Kalman filter framework. The performance of the proposed sensor fusion method was verified with experiments using a motorized motion stage, and the results show that the displacements can be estimated with high accuracy regardless of measurement noise and slowly varying signal drift.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60121523","afid":"60121523","affilname":"Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology (KICT)","affiliation-city":"Goyang","affiliation-country":"South Korea"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60068689","afid":"60068689","affilname":"Hanbat National University","affiliation-city":"Yusong","affiliation-country":"South Korea"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022417","afid":"60022417","affilname":"Chungnam National University","affiliation-city":"Daejeon","affiliation-country":"South Korea"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35111510200","authid":"35111510200","authname":"Jeon H.","surname":"Jeon","given-name":"Haemin","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60068689"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24332241700","authid":"24332241700","authname":"Min J.","surname":"Min","given-name":"Jiyoung","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60121523"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57215413622","authid":"57215413622","authname":"Bang H.","surname":"Bang","given-name":"Hyuntae","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022417"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56664290800","authid":"56664290800","orcid":"0000-0001-6954-9059","authname":"Youn W.","surname":"Youn","given-name":"Wonkeun","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022417"}]}],"authkeywords":"6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) displacement | inertial measurement unit (IMU) | quaternion-based iterative extended Kalman filter (QIEKF) | sensor fusion | vision sensor","source-id":"15047","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85140786377"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85140786377?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85140786377&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85140786377&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85140786377","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85140786377","eid":"2-s2.0-85140786377","dc:title":"A Pyramid Model of Convolutional Neural Network to Classify Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Images","dc:creator":"Muntasa A.","prism:publicationName":"International Journal of Intelligent Engineering and Systems","prism:issn":"2185310X","prism:eIssn":"21853118","prism:volume":"15","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"576-588","prism:coverDate":"2022-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2022","prism:doi":"10.22266/ijies2022.1231.51","dc:description":"Many researchers have classified acute lymphoblastic leukemia using several methods.

Namely, every pair of dimension is orthogonal to each other and thus there is no distinction of in-between relations of dimensions. However, this is certainly not the case in real world signals which naturally originate from a spatio-temporal configuration. As a result, the conventional vectorization process disrupts all of the spatio-temporal information about the order/place of data whether it be 1D, 2D, 3D, or 4D. In this paper, the problem of orthogonality is first investigated through conventional k-means of images, where images are to be processed as vectors. As a solution, shift-invariant k-means is proposed in a novel framework with the help of sparse representations. A generalization of shift-invariant k-means, convolutional dictionary learning is then utilized as an unsupervised feature extraction method for classification. Experiments suggest that Gabor feature extraction as a simulation of shallow convolutional neural networks provides a little better performance compared to convolutional dictionary learning. Other alternatives of convolutional-logic are also discussed for spatio-temporal information preservation, including a spatio-temporal hypercomplex encoding scheme.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020241","afid":"60020241","affilname":"Izmir Ekonomi Universitesi","affiliation-city":"Izmir","affiliation-country":"Turkey"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56560191100","authid":"56560191100","authname":"Oktar Y.","surname":"Oktar","given-name":"Yigit","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020241"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219464962","authid":"57219464962","orcid":"0000-0002-9780-9249","authname":"Turkan M.","surname":"Turkan","given-name":"Mehmet","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020241"}]}],"authkeywords":"Convolutional dictionary learning | Geometric algebra | Machine learning | Neural networks | Sparse representations | Tensors","source-id":"11400153333","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85135248715"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85135248715?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85135248715&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85135248715&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85135248715","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85135248715","eid":"2-s2.0-85135248715","dc:title":"Vision-Kinematics Interaction for Robotic-Assisted Bronchoscopy Navigation","dc:creator":"Gu Y.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","prism:issn":"02780062","prism:eIssn":"1558254X","prism:volume":"41","prism:issueIdentifier":"12","prism:pageRange":"3600-3610","prism:coverDate":"2022-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 December 2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/TMI.2022.3191317","dc:description":"Endobronchial intervention is increasingly used as a minimally invasive means for the treatment of pulmonary diseases. In order to acquire the position of bronchoscopy, vision-based localization approaches are clinically preferable but are sensitive to visual variations. The static nature of pre-operative planning makes mapping of intraoperative anatomical features challenging for learning-based methods using visual features alone. In this work, we propose a robust navigation framework based on Vision Kinematic Interaction (VKI) for monocular bronchoscopic videos. To address visual-imbalance between the virtual and real views of bronchoscopy images, a Visual Similarity Network (VSN) is proposed to extract domain-invariant features to represent the lumen structure from endoscopic views, as well as domain-specific features to characterize the surface texture and visual artefacts. To improve the robustness of online estimation of camera pose, we also introduce a Kinematic Refinement Network (KRN) that allows progressive refinement of camera pose estimation based on network prediction and robot control signals. The accuracy of camera localization is validated on phantom and porcine lung datasets from a robotically controlled endobronchial intervention system, with both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrating the performance of the techniques. Results show that the features extracted by the proposed method can preserve the structural information of small airways in the presence of large visual variations along with the much-improved camera localization accuracy. The absolute trajectory errors (ATE) on phantom data and porcine data are 8.01 mm and 8.62 mm respectively.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073638","afid":"60073638","affilname":"Shanghai Chest Hospital","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025084","afid":"60025084","affilname":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"35839186","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55836552300","authid":"55836552300","orcid":"0000-0002-4199-0675","authname":"Gu Y.","surname":"Gu","given-name":"Yun","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57223147074","authid":"57223147074","authname":"Gu C.","surname":"Gu","given-name":"Chuanjia","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073638"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15039078800","authid":"15039078800","orcid":"0000-0003-4801-7162","authname":"Yang J.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Jie","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209194381","authid":"57209194381","orcid":"0000-0003-3158-3256","authname":"Sun J.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Jiayuan","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073638"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211728432","authid":"57211728432","orcid":"0000-0003-4060-4020","authname":"Yang G.Z.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Guang Zhong","initials":"G.Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]}],"authkeywords":"kinematics | Vision-based navigation | visual similarity","source-id":"16733","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85134509485"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85134509485?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85134509485&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85134509485&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85134509485","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85134509485","eid":"2-s2.0-85134509485","dc:title":"Polynomial rooting-based DOA estimation algorithm for vector-sensor arrays using quaternions","dc:creator":"Jamshidpour S.","prism:publicationName":"Multidimensional Systems and Signal Processing","prism:issn":"09236082","prism:eIssn":"15730824","prism:volume":"33","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"1221-1235","prism:coverDate":"2022-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2022","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11045-022-00841-z","dc:description":"This paper considers the problem of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation using uniform linear arrays (ULAs) composed of two-component electromagnetic vector-sensors.

This criterion enables us to utilize the Vandermonde structure of the spatial steering vector of a ULA to develop a polynomial rooting-based DOA estimation algorithm, denoted by Q-Root-MUSIC. The proposed method replaces the need for a search procedure over the DOA and the polarization parameters with a polynomial rooting procedure which significantly reduces the computational burden of the method.

Finally, we apply the structure-preserving algorithm of the full rank decomposition to the sparse representation classification of color images, and the classification effect is well.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104679","afid":"60104679","affilname":"Heze University","affiliation-city":"Wuhu","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073585","afid":"60073585","affilname":"Linyi University","affiliation-city":"Linyi","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013628","afid":"60013628","affilname":"North-Eastern Federal University","affiliation-city":"Yakutsk","affiliation-country":"Russian Federation"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57212191362","authid":"57212191362","orcid":"0000-0001-6008-630X","authname":"Wang G.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Gang","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013628"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104679"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57212194896","authid":"57212194896","authname":"Zhang D.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Dong","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013628"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104679"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56385269200","authid":"56385269200","authname":"Vasiliev V.I.","surname":"Vasiliev","given-name":"Vasily I.","initials":"V.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013628"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402148420","authid":"7402148420","authname":"Jiang T.","surname":"Jiang","given-name":"Tongsong","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013628"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104679"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073585"}]}],"authkeywords":"Complex representation | Complex structure-preserving algorithm | Full rank decomposition | Quaternion matrix | Sparse representation classification","source-id":"25708","fund-acr":"CSC","fund-no":"ZR201709250116","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China-Shandong Joint Fund","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85127230657"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85127230657?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85127230657&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85127230657&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85127230657","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85127230657","eid":"2-s2.0-85127230657","dc:title":"Functional movement screen dataset collected with two Azure Kinect depth sensors","dc:creator":"Xing Q.J.","prism:publicationName":"Scientific Data","prism:eIssn":"20524463","prism:volume":"9","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2022","prism:doi":"10.1038/s41597-022-01188-7","dc:description":"This paper presents a dataset for vision-based autonomous Functional Movement Screen (FMS) collected from 45 human subjects of different ages (18–59 years old) executing the following movements: deep squat, hurdle step, in-line lunge, shoulder mobility, active straight raise, trunk stability push-up and rotary stability. Specifically, shoulder mobility was performed only once by different subjects, while the other movements were repeated for three episodes each. Each episode was saved as one record and was annotated from 0 to 3 by three FMS experts. The main strength of our database is twofold. One is the multimodal data provided, including color images, depth images, quaternions, 3D human skeleton joints and 2D pixel trajectories of 32 joints. The other is the multiview data collected from the two synchronized Azure Kinect sensors in front of and on the side of the subjects. Finally, our dataset contains a total of 1812 recordings, with 3624 episodes. The size of the dataset is 190 GB.

Energy drain is one of the major causes for node faults. Hence, in this research article, a hybrid optimization algorithm is developed for fault-tolerant and accurate localization in UWSN. In this technique, Artificial Butterfly Optimization (ABO) algorithm is applied for finding the distance between the anchors and the sensors. Each non-localized node runs ABO algorithm for finding the distance amid the anchor or beacon nodes. Then, applying Quaternion-based Backtracking Search Optimization (QBSA) algorithm, non-localized sensor nodes are localized and to decrease the localization error based on the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), battery energy, and distance parameters. Aqua-Sim a tool kit of NS2 is an open-source software developed for Underwater Wireless Sensor Network research, and this proposed algorithm will be implemented using this software. By simulation results, it is shown that the proposed optimization algorithm reduces the localization error, latency, and cost and energy consumption.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60113205","afid":"60113205","affilname":"Chitkara University, Punjab","affiliation-city":"Rajpura","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60108632","afid":"60108632","affilname":"J.C.

More recently, it has become popular for a sole attitude determination device to be considered. This is especially the case for a star tracker given its unbiased stellar measurement and recent improvements in optical sensor performance. The state device indirectly estimates the attitude rate using a known dynamic model. In estimation theory, two main attitude filtering approaches are classified, the additive and the multiplicative. Each refers to the nature of the quaternion update in the filter. In this article, these two techniques are implemented for the case of a sole star tracker, using simulated and real night sky image data. Both sets of results are presented and compared with each other, with a baseline established through a basic linear least square estimate. The state approach is more accurate and precise for measuring angular velocity than using the error-based filter. However, no discernible difference is observed between each technique for determining pointing. These results are important not only for sole device attitude determination systems, but also for space situational awareness object localisation, where attitude and rate estimate accuracy are highly important.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60090755","afid":"60090755","affilname":"Faculty of Engineering","affiliation-city":"Sydney","affiliation-country":"Australia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025709","afid":"60025709","affilname":"The University of Sydney","affiliation-city":"Sydney","affiliation-country":"Australia"}],"pubmed-id":"36433598","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203360925","authid":"57203360925","orcid":"0000-0002-3820-8603","authname":"Critchley-Marrows J.J.R.","surname":"Critchley-Marrows","given-name":"Joshua J.R.","initials":"J.J.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60090755"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55715048000","authid":"55715048000","authname":"Wu X.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Xiaofeng","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60090755"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56431291100","authid":"56431291100","orcid":"0000-0001-6978-9765","authname":"Cairns I.H.","surname":"Cairns","given-name":"Iver H.","initials":"I.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025709"}]}],"authkeywords":"attitude | Kalman Filter | SSA | star tracker | Static Attitude Estimation","article-number":"9002","source-id":"130124","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85139517261"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85139517261?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85139517261&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85139517261&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85139517261","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85139517261","eid":"2-s2.0-85139517261","dc:title":"Quantitative Analysis of Lower Limb Motion in Parkinson's Disease Based on Inertial Sensors","dc:creator":"Liu R.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Sensors Journal","prism:issn":"1530437X","prism:eIssn":"15581748","prism:volume":"22","prism:issueIdentifier":"21","prism:pageRange":"20937-20946","prism:coverDate":"2022-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 November 2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2022.3208734","dc:description":"This study proposed a wearable inertial motion capture (Mocap) method for Parkinson's lower limb motion reconstruction and analysis. To eliminate the error accumulation caused by sensor noise, the error state Kalman filter is used for attitude estimation. The inertial Mocap method proposed in this study is compared with the OptiTrack system to verify the motion tracking effect. The accuracy of different phase-detection methods is compared, and the highest recognition accuracy is 99.11% using the long short-term memory (LSTM) method. In addition, this study collected subjects in healthy control (HC), Parkinson's disease (PD), and freezing of gait (FOG) groups for comparative analysis. The experimental results revealed differences in motion characteristics and kinematics between PD and healthy subjects. Thus, the quantitative analysis results can be used as an important reference for the clinical application of PD.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004538","afid":"60004538","affilname":"Dalian University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/128527871","afid":"128527871","affilname":"Dalian Municipal Central Hospital","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57212080313","authid":"57212080313","orcid":"0000-0002-1631-9652","authname":"Liu R.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Ruichen","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9239871400","authid":"9239871400","orcid":"0000-0003-4959-3372","authname":"Wang Z.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Zhelong","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55715813000","authid":"55715813000","orcid":"0000-0003-1510-5289","authname":"Zhao H.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Hongyu","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55574998200","authid":"55574998200","orcid":"0000-0001-6846-546X","authname":"Qiu S.","surname":"Qiu","given-name":"Sen","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201152435","authid":"57201152435","authname":"Wang C.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Cui","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"128527871"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201737187","authid":"57201737187","orcid":"0000-0001-9795-2160","authname":"Shi X.","surname":"Shi","given-name":"Xin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57215883354","authid":"57215883354","orcid":"0000-0002-5855-540X","authname":"Lin F.","surname":"Lin","given-name":"Fang","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]}],"authkeywords":"Freezing of gait (FOG) | gait analysis | motion capture (Mocap) | phase detection | sensor data fusion","source-id":"15047","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85139367305"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85139367305?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85139367305&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85139367305&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0030402622012906"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85139367305","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85139367305","eid":"2-s2.0-85139367305","dc:title":"Continuous and discrete quaternion linear canonical wave packet transform","dc:creator":"Rejini M.T.","prism:publicationName":"Optik","prism:issn":"00304026","prism:volume":"270","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2022","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.ijleo.2022.170032","pii":"S0030402622012906","dc:description":"In this paper, we widen the domain of wave packet transform and linear canonical wave packet transform to the quaternion algebra.

Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a recently proposed method to robustly decompose a video sequence into the background model and the corresponding foreground part. However, this method needs to convert the color image into a grayscale image for processing, which leads to the neglect of the coupling information between the three channels of the color image. In this study, we propose a quaternion-based DMD (Q-DMD), which extends the DMD by quaternion matrix analysis, so as to ultimately preserve the inherent color structure of the color image and the color video. We exploit the standard eigenvalues of the quaternion matrix to compute its spectral decomposition and calculate the corresponding Q-DMD modes and eigenvalues. The results on the publicly available benchmark datasets prove that our Q-DMD outperforms the exact DMD method, and experiment results also demonstrate that the performance of our approach is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art ones.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028009","afid":"60028009","affilname":"Yunnan University","affiliation-city":"Kunming","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57392528300","authid":"57392528300","authname":"Han J.","surname":"Han","given-name":"Juan","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003837546","authid":"7003837546","orcid":"0000-0003-1924-9087","authname":"Kou K.I.","surname":"Kou","given-name":"Kit Ian","initials":"K.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201452670","authid":"57201452670","authname":"Miao J.","surname":"Miao","given-name":"Jifei","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028009"}]}],"authkeywords":"Background model initialization | Color videos | Dynamic mode decomposition | Quaternion","article-number":"103560","source-id":"24161","fund-acr":"UM","fund-no":"MYRG2019-00039-FST","fund-sponsor":"Universidade de Macau","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85139026257"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85139026257?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85139026257&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85139026257&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0030402622012682"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85139026257","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85139026257","eid":"2-s2.0-85139026257","dc:title":"Small and dim infrared moving target detection based on spatial–temporal saliency","dc:creator":"Li Z.","prism:publicationName":"Optik","prism:issn":"00304026","prism:volume":"270","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2022","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.ijleo.2022.170010","pii":"S0030402622012682","dc:description":"Infrared target detection is a significant work in military, high accuracy and high speed are the essential capabilities for precise guidance.

Due to the high time complexity of the quaternion, a real structure-preserving algorithm is used to shorten the running time of the proposed algorithm by about 20 times compared with the quaternion toolbox of Matlab.
