However, a number of factors make this task challenging. Background complexity, as well as the fact that cracks are visually inhomogenous to one another also contribute to this difficulty. Furthermore, cracks in road surfaces can be easily confused with foreign objects, shadows and background textures leading to detection ambiguities. Timely detection of cracks is important for both drivers and road maintenance crews. Quaternion neural networks (QNNs) are a relatively new class of neural networks that employ quaternionvalued activations and parameters. They benefit from reduced costs in terms of hardware as they require fewer parameters. In this work, we explore the usability of QNNs for automatic road crack detection. To this end, we propose quaternionic versions of deep networks and evaluate their performance in datasets with images of road cracks. We show that the proposed models are light-weight in terms of parameter requirements while they are on par in terms of performance with real-valued networks for crack detection, with potential applications in resource constrained scenarios or in cases where few training data is available.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60110806","afid":"60110806","affilname":"University of West Attica","affiliation-city":"Athens","affiliation-country":"Greece"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004716","afid":"60004716","affilname":"University of Ioannina","affiliation-city":"Ioannina","affiliation-country":"Greece"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001104","afid":"60001104","affilname":"National Centre for Scientific Research \"DEMOKRITOS\"","affiliation-city":"Athens","affiliation-country":"Greece"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57824050100","authid":"57824050100","authname":"Katsaliros A.","surname":"Katsaliros","given-name":"Aggelos","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004716"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57824579900","authid":"57824579900","authname":"Panagos I.I.","surname":"Panagos","given-name":"Iason Ioannis","initials":"I.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004716"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36893579300","authid":"36893579300","authname":"Sfikas G.","surname":"Sfikas","given-name":"Giorgos","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004716"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60110806"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001104"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004062610","authid":"7004062610","authname":"Nikou C.","surname":"Nikou","given-name":"Christophoros","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004716"}]}],"authkeywords":"Hypercomptex Numbers | Quaternions | Road Crack Detection","source-id":"21101098851","fund-acr":"EC","fund-no":"K-03785","fund-sponsor":"European Commission","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85135069700"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85135069700?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85135069700&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85135069700&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85135069700","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85135069700","eid":"2-s2.0-85135069700","dc:title":"A Novel Robust Adaptive Color Image Watermarking Scheme Based on Artificial Bee Colony","dc:creator":"Xiao T.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering","prism:issn":"18761100","prism:eIssn":"18761119","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789811924552"}],"prism:volume":"942 LNEE","prism:pageRange":"1006-1017","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-981-19-2456-9_101","dc:description":"This paper proposes a new robust adaptive watermarking scheme based on dual-tree quaternion wavelet and artificial bee colony, wherein the host images and watermark images are both color images.

During the optimization process, ill-considered representations of rotation may even trap the objective function at local minima. This paper aims to expose these issues and propose the Transformed Grid Distance loss as a solution. The proposed method not only solves the problem of rotation representation but unites the gap between translation and rotation.

In the literature, the theoretical guarantee for quaternion matrix completion is not well established. Our main aim is to propose a new minimization problem with an objective combining nuclear norm and a quadratic loss weighted among three channels. To fill the theoretical vacancy, we obtain the error bound in both clean and corrupted regimes, which relies on some new results of quaternion matrices. A general Gaussian noise is considered in robust completion where all observations are corrupted. Motivated by the error bound, we propose to handle unbalanced or correlated noise via a cross-channel weight in the quadratic loss, with the main purpose of rebalancing noise level or removing noise correlation. Extensive experimental results on synthetic and color image data are presented to confirm and demonstrate our theoretical findings.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006541","afid":"60006541","affilname":"The University of Hong Kong","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57271603700","authid":"57271603700","authname":"Chen J.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Junren","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006541"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34571761900","authid":"34571761900","authname":"Ng M.K.","surname":"Ng","given-name":"Michael K.","initials":"M.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006541"}]}],"authkeywords":"color image | error bound | inpainting | quaternion matrix | robust matrix completion","source-id":"19700186911","fund-no":"12300519","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85134338413"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85134338413?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85134338413&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85134338413&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85134338413","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85134338413","eid":"2-s2.0-85134338413","dc:title":"Quaternion Discrete Racah Moments Convolutional Neural Network for Color Face Recognition","dc:creator":"Alami A.E.","prism:publicationName":"2022 International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Computer Vision, ISCV 2022","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781665495585"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/ISCV54655.2022.9806123","dc:description":"In this paper, we propose a novel architecture called quaternion discrete Racah moments convolutional neural network (QRMCNN) for color face recognition to improve the recognition accuracy and to reduce the computational complexity.

The introduced solution consists of two parts: a filter and a controller. First, an adaptive NN-based stochastic filter is proposed, which estimates attitude components and dynamics using measurements supplied by onboard sensors directly. The filter design accounts for measurement uncertainties inherent to the attitude dynamics, namely, unknown bias and noise corrupting angular velocity measurements. The closed-loop signals of the proposed NN-based stochastic filter have been shown to be semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Second, a novel control law on <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{SO}(3)$</tex-math> </inline-formula> coupled with the proposed estimator is presented. The control law addresses unknown disturbances. In addition, the closed-loop signals of the proposed filter-based controller have been shown to be SGUUB.

While the filter-based controller is presented in continuous form, the discrete implementation is also presented. In addition, the unit-quaternion form of the proposed approach is given. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed filter-based controller are demonstrated using its discrete form and considering low sampling rate, high initialization error, high level of measurement uncertainties, and unknown disturbances.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019647","afid":"60019647","affilname":"Georgia Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Atlanta","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017592","afid":"60017592","affilname":"Carleton University","affiliation-city":"Ottawa","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191054010","authid":"57191054010","authname":"Hashim H.A.","surname":"Hashim","given-name":"Hashim A.","initials":"H.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017592"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24726183300","authid":"24726183300","authname":"Vamvoudakis K.G.","surname":"Vamvoudakis","given-name":"Kyriakos G.","initials":"K.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019647"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude tracking control | neuroadaptive | nonlinear filter | observer-based controller | stochastic differential equations","source-id":"21100235616","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85133674735"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85133674735?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85133674735&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85133674735&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85133674735","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85133674735","eid":"2-s2.0-85133674735","dc:title":"Polarization-Aware Prediction of Mobile Radio Wave Propagation Based on Complex-Valued and Quaternion Neural Networks","dc:creator":"Chen H.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Access","prism:eIssn":"21693536","prism:volume":"10","prism:pageRange":"66589-66600","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3184788","dc:description":"It is important to predict the characteristics of radio waves propagating in wireless environment for compensating information loss caused by fading effects. Though fading is often analyzed as the changes of intrinsic electric-field phasor describing a communication channel, it is also attributed greatly to its polarization state (PS). In this paper, we propose PS and phasor prediction methods based on quaternion neural networks (QNNs) and complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs). Quaternion is a hypercomplex number system for representing three dimensional (3-D) spatial rotation and orientation. It realizes adaptive prediction more stably and effectively than a real-valued rotation matrix. The time trajectories of PS are expressed as 3-D rotational motions on the Poincare sphere. We show that QNNs learn the spatiotemporal movements of the PS with high generalization ability and thus provide a superior prediction performance. In addition, CVNNs are efficient predictors for processing complex-valued signals such as the phasor of an incident wave. We evaluate the precision of the proposed QNN-CVNN prediction scheme in channel equalization in a time-division-duplex (TDD) orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) communication system. In physical wireless-environment experiments, we find that the proposed scheme provides 3.0 dB and 6.0 dB improvements of bit error rate (BER) at 10-4, showing almost the same BER performance as a system perfectly knowing the actual radio-wave characteristics in future TDD frames. Accordingly, this work also reveals that PS needs to be considered as one of the significant characteristics in various radio-wave systems in the near-future technology.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025272","afid":"60025272","affilname":"The University of Tokyo","affiliation-city":"Tokyo","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57789931000","authid":"57789931000","orcid":"0000-0003-2388-2299","authname":"Chen H.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Haotian","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025272"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35795724100","authid":"35795724100","orcid":"0000-0003-2291-4375","authname":"Natsuaki R.","surname":"Natsuaki","given-name":"Ryo","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025272"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35416951600","authid":"35416951600","orcid":"0000-0002-6936-9733","authname":"Hirose A.","surname":"Hirose","given-name":"Akira","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025272"}]}],"authkeywords":"complex-valued neural network | polarization state | quaternion neural network | Radio wave prediction","source-id":"21100374601","fund-acr":"KAKEN","fund-no":"18H04105","fund-sponsor":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85133400277"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85133400277?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85133400277&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85133400277&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85133400277","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85133400277","eid":"2-s2.0-85133400277","dc:title":"Depth Map Reconstruction Method in Control Problems for Robots and Mechatronic Systems","dc:creator":"Zelensky A.A.","prism:publicationName":"Mekhatronika, Avtomatizatsiya, Upravlenie","prism:issn":"16846427","prism:eIssn":"26191253","prism:volume":"23","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"104-112","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.17587/mau.23.104-112","dc:description":"In modern robotic and mechatronic systems, technologies are in demand that makes it possible to build an optimal trajectory of movement of their actuators. Such technologies are formed by combining navigation methods and building a 3-D map of the surrounding space based on vision systems and are successfully used in robotics and mechatronics. But there is a problem, consisting of a decrease in the accuracy of planning the trajectory of movement, caused by incorrect sections on the map (depth map) due to incorrect determination of the distance to objects. Such defects appear as a result of poor lighting, specular or fine-grained surfaces of objects. This leads to the impossibility of obtaining reliable information about the depth. As a result, the effect of increasing the boundaries of objects (obstacles) appears, and the overlapping of objects makes it impossible to distinguish one object from another. This problem can be solved using image reconstruction methods. The article presents an approach based on a modified algorithm for searching for similar blocks using the concept of quaternions and anisotropic gradient. The analysis of the research results shows that the proposed method allows you to correctly restore the boundaries of objects on the depth map image when reconstructing 3-D scenes, which contributes to an increase in the accuracy of planning the trajectory of motion of the actuators robotic and mechatronic systems.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018011","afid":"60018011","affilname":"Donskoj Gosudarstvennyj Tehniceskij Universitet","affiliation-city":"Rostov-on-Don","affiliation-country":"Russian Federation"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014196","afid":"60014196","affilname":"Moscow State Technological University Stankin","affiliation-city":"Moscow","affiliation-country":"Russian Federation"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204649388","authid":"57204649388","authname":"Zelensky A.A.","surname":"Zelensky","given-name":"A.

For color images, most methods tackle different color channels in a separate way, which overlooks the connection between the color channels. Therefore, in this letter, we consider a quaternion-based model to reserve the color connectivity, which integrates the color information of a pixel by a quaternion number. Moreover, we propose a regularizer based on the gamma-correction function and incorporate it into a screened Poisson equation for the image enhancement task. The uniqueness and existence of the solution of the proposed model are analyzed.

The practical application of such a system showed that it is hard to get a universal model that is suitable for precise attitude estimation on different types of activity. In this paper, a two-step solution is proposed, constructed from an activity recognition stage and switchable models for the prediction of quaternion parameters followed by attitude estimation. An exper-imental investigation was performed on publicly available data taken from the Berlin Robust Orientation Estimation Assessment Dataset.

Firstly, each dance movement video in the dataset is divided into equal parts, while the segmented videos are subjected to the operation of accumulating edge features separately, and the edge features in all video images within each segment are accumulated into one image, and the directional gradient histogram features are extracted from them. Finally, a set of directional gradient histogram features are used to represent the local appearance and shape of the video dance movement. The reconstructed human movements are obtained mainly by fitting the 3D human coordinates in the image space using the human model and the estimated depth coordinates, which are currently more mature and are chosen from existing techniques. In other combinations, the performance of the method in this paper is better than the recognition results of the benchmark method, especially when the similarities of dance movements in the towel flower combination and the piece flower combination are too high. In response to the problem of the reconstructed action appearing to have ground penetration, slipping, and floating feet, a method is proposed to optimize the fitting human model foot problem according to the foot touching the ground. The experimental results show that the method can replace the traditional motion capture method to a certain extent, simplify the use of motion capture, and reduce the cost of motion capture. In the model deformation stage, to reduce the deformation quality problem during the model motion and improve the efficiency of weight calculation, a model deformation method combining double quaternions and bounded double tuning and weights are given. The static 3D model is tetrahedralization, and then the skeletal control points of the model are set and the weight of each skeletal segment to the model is calculated; next, the 3D model is mixed and bound with the skeletal data using the dual quaternion skinning algorithm; finally, the static 3D model motion is driven by the skeletal data. Experiments demonstrate that the method results in better deformation of the 3D model during rotation.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022279","afid":"60022279","affilname":"Shanghai Normal University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57742439200","authid":"57742439200","orcid":"0000-0002-3988-9498","authname":"Jin Y.","surname":"Jin","given-name":"Yan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022279"}]}],"article-number":"3212308","source-id":"13082","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85131957409"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85131957409?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85131957409&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85131957409&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85131957409","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85131957409","eid":"2-s2.0-85131957409","dc:title":"3rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, ICPRAI 2022","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783031090363"}],"prism:volume":"13363 LNCS","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 98 papers.

Each agent in the system cooperatively solves the minimum of the global objective function through the information of itself and its neighbors. At first, the related convex analysis of the quaternion field is given, which provides a theoretical basis for solving the nonsmooth QDOP. Then the considered QDOP is equivalently transformed by using the connectivity of the communication topology. After that, a distributed QNA is presented, where the adaptive controller is introduced to ensure that the penalty terms with respect to the inequality constraints can self-adjust according to the local states. It is shown that all agents reach a consensus while obtaining the optimal solution to the related QDOP. Finally, a numerical example and an application in dictionary sparse representation of color images based on quaternion are realized to intuitively describe the effectiveness and practical significance of the proposed QNA.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60088567","afid":"60088567","affilname":"Beijing Information Science &amp; Technology University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000937","afid":"60000937","affilname":"Shenzhen University","affiliation-city":"Shenzhen","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56163691800","authid":"56163691800","authname":"Li G.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Guocheng","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60088567"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57224143768","authid":"57224143768","orcid":"0000-0002-4325-0347","authname":"Luan L.","surname":"Luan","given-name":"Linhua","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26534921900","authid":"26534921900","orcid":"0000-0002-4543-4940","authname":"Qin S.","surname":"Qin","given-name":"Sitian","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24482867300","authid":"24482867300","authname":"Feng J.","surname":"Feng","given-name":"Jiqiang","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000937"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive controller | multi-agent system | nonsmooth | quaternion distributed optimization problem (QDOP) | quaternion-valued neurodynamic approach (QNA)","source-id":"21100374601","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"11871178","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85131271103"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85131271103?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85131271103&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85131271103&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85131271103","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85131271103","eid":"2-s2.0-85131271103","dc:title":"Non-Local Robust Quaternion Matrix Completion for Large-Scale Color Image and Video Inpainting","dc:creator":"Jia Z.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","prism:issn":"10577149","prism:eIssn":"19410042","prism:volume":"31","prism:pageRange":"3868-3883","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/TIP.2022.3176133","dc:description":"The image nonlocal self-similarity (NSS) prior refers to the fact that a local patch often has many nonlocal similar patches to it across the image and has been widely applied in many recently proposed machining learning algorithms for image processing. However, there is no theoretical analysis on its working principle in the literature. In this paper, we discover a potential causality between NSS and low-rank property of color images, which is also available to grey images. A new patch group based NSS prior scheme is proposed to learn explicit NSS models of natural color images. The numerical low-rank property of patched matrices is also rigorously proved. The NSS-based QMC algorithm computes an optimal low-rank approximation to the high-rank color image, resulting in high PSNR and SSIM measures and particularly the better visual quality. A new tensor NSS-based QMC method is also presented to solve the color video inpainting problem based on quaternion tensor representation. The numerical experiments on color images and videos indicate the advantages of NSS-based QMC over the state-of-the-art methods.","citedby-count":"20","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029380","afid":"60029380","affilname":"Inner Mongolia University China","affiliation-city":"Hohhot","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006541","afid":"60006541","affilname":"The University of Hong Kong","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005465","afid":"60005465","affilname":"University of Electronic Science and Technology of China","affiliation-city":"Chengdu","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004691","afid":"60004691","affilname":"Jiangsu Normal University","affiliation-city":"Xuzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"35617180","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8264355300","authid":"8264355300","orcid":"0000-0001-9408-0942","authname":"Jia Z.","surname":"Jia","given-name":"Zhigang","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004691"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55248368700","authid":"55248368700","orcid":"0000-0001-8639-233X","authname":"Jin Q.","surname":"Jin","given-name":"Qiyu","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029380"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34571761900","authid":"34571761900","orcid":"0000-0001-6833-5227","authname":"Ng M.K.","surname":"Ng","given-name":"Michael K.","initials":"M.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006541"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24073933900","authid":"24073933900","orcid":"0000-0002-6540-946X","authname":"Zhao X.L.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Xi Le","initials":"X.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]}],"authkeywords":"color image inpainting | color video | Low-rank approximation | nonlocal self-similarity | quaternion singular value decomposition","source-id":"25534","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85131157226"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85131157226?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85131157226&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85131157226&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85131157226","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85131157226","eid":"2-s2.0-85131157226","dc:title":"Design of a Professional Sports Competition Adjudication System Based on Data Analysis and Action Recognition Algorithm","dc:creator":"Lin Q.","prism:publicationName":"Scientific Programming","prism:issn":"10589244","prism:volume":"2022","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1155/2022/9402195","dc:description":"This paper uses data analysis and action recognition algorithms to conduct in-depth research and analysis of professional sports competition judging and designs a professional sports competition-assisted judging system for use in actual judging. In this paper, a wearable motion capture system based on an inertial sensing unit is developed and designed for kayaking technical motion monitoring to achieve the acquisition, analysis, and quantitative evaluation of kayaker motion data. To limit the gyroscope and pose estimation error, a gradient descent method is used for multisensor data fusion to achieve athlete pose update, and a quaternion-driven human skeletal vector model is proposed to reconstruct the kayaker's paddling technical movements. By calculating the angular sequences of the left shoulder, right shoulder, left elbow, and right elbow joints of the athlete's upper limbs and comparing them with the optical motion capture system, the results show that the motion capture system developed in this paper is comparable to the optical motion capture system in terms of measurement accuracy. It ultimately affects the result of pose estimation. Therefore, high-resolution networks and low-resolution networks can continuously maintain high-resolution features of the image by allowing each representation layer to repeatedly accept the representation information of other networks. A step matrix model is constructed to encode the multiscale global temporal information of action sequences, and action classification is achieved by calculating the response of the step matrix of test samples to the step matrix of each category of actions. The algorithm achieves 78.96%, 91.84%, and 91.18% accuracy of action classification on the Northwestern-UCLA database, MSRC-12 database, and CAD-60 database, respectively. The designed visual motion tracking system was applied to record the motion data of the experimental subjects in the fine motion assessment task and construct the motion assessment database. The experimental results show that the average error between the prediction results of the proposed action assessment method and the manual scoring is 1.83, and the automated assessment of fine movements is effectively realized.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025945","afid":"60025945","affilname":"Lanzhou University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Lanzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/128172031","afid":"128172031","affilname":"Shanghai Lixin University of Finance and Economics","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113184016","afid":"113184016","affilname":"Shanghai Second Medical College","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57722773300","authid":"57722773300","orcid":"0000-0002-8559-6039","authname":"Lin Q.","surname":"Lin","given-name":"Qianfeng","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025945"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113184016"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57723557300","authid":"57723557300","orcid":"0000-0002-0268-339X","authname":"Zou J.","surname":"Zou","given-name":"Jiashu","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"128172031"}]}],"article-number":"9402195","source-id":"19926","fund-acr":"LUT","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Lanzhou University of Technology","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85131146649"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85131146649?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85131146649&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85131146649&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85131146649","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85131146649","eid":"2-s2.0-85131146649","dc:title":"15th IAPR International Workshop on Document Analysis Systems, DAS 2022","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783031065545"}],"prism:volume":"13237 LNCS","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 52 papers.

Despite good performance, it has few serious drawbacks that it cannot properly encode the orientation and spatial positioning of components of the input data and it also suffers from overfitting. Quaternion CNN is a generalization of traditional CNN and it can properly encode internal and external dependencies between the components of the input data and it is free from overfitting and its generalization performance is better than conventional CNN. It can be modified to work with all Deep Neural Network (DNN) models with quaternion as input. In this paper, the authors have proposed quaternion residual learning for the classification of breast cancer in the BreakHis dataset of breast histopathological images. They have observed that quaternion CNN outperforms to real CNN.

The range of each component of the output value of the traditional neural network is unconstrained, which is difficult to meet the needs of practical problems. To solve this problem, this paper designed the transformation network layer according to the high dimensional space transformation theory and constructed a constrained neural network model to detect the pose of objects from a single aerial image. Firstly, in the yolov3 network structure, according to the size of the three field scales, three scale transformation network layers are added correspondingly to implement the constrained unit quaternion field. Secondly, according to the characteristics of quaternion, we proposed a special loss function. Then a new constrained neural network called the quaternion field pose network (qfiled PoseNet) model is constructed, which can predict the probability field of the object and the contained unit quaternion field respectively. Next, The object's probability field is generated to determine the 2D bounding box of the object, and the unit quaternion field is generated to determine the 3D rotation R. Finally, combining the rotation matrix R and the 2D bounding box of the object to calculate the 3D translation T. We used our method to experiment on DOTA1.5 data set and the HSRC2016 data set respectively. The experimental results show that our method can detect the pose of the object well.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029306","afid":"60029306","affilname":"Wuhan University","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57701806900","authid":"57701806900","orcid":"0000-0003-3736-5196","authname":"Zhang H.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Hongyun","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029306"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57867798600","authid":"57867798600","orcid":"0000-0001-9052-1114","authname":"Liu J.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Jin","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029306"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57215089879","authid":"57215089879","authname":"Gao Y.","surname":"Gao","given-name":"Yongjian","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029306"}]}],"authkeywords":"3D rotation | 3D translation | Constrained neural network | Unit quaternion","source-id":"21100374601","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85130293923"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85130293923?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85130293923&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85130293923&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85130293923","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85130293923","eid":"2-s2.0-85130293923","dc:title":"At the Roots of Jung’s Alchemy: Part I: The Red Book’s Alchemical Quaternion","dc:creator":"Boccassini D.","prism:publicationName":"Jung Journal: Culture and Psyche","prism:issn":"19342039","prism:eIssn":"19342047","prism:volume":"16","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"19-46","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1080/19342039.2022.2053466","dc:description":"It is a well-known fact that Jung decided to devote himself to a systematic study of the European alchemical tradition at the beginning of the 1930s.
