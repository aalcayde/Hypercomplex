Diagnosis of these diseases using an identification system limited by human visual capabilities often lead to misinterpretation of diseases, causing severe yield losses. An automated fungal disease identification method in banana plants using nondecimated quaternion wavelet Transform (NDQWT) and texture features is being detailed in this paper. The discoloration pattern appearing on banana leaf blade, at the early stages of infection, are used for classifying three major fungal diseases namely, Sigatoka, Cordana and Deightoneilla. The captured leaf images are enhanced and segmentation algorithms are applied to identify the infected regions. The segmented images are converted to transform domain using spatial-frequency transforms (discrete wavelet transforms (DWT), dual tree complex wavelet transforms (DTCWT) and NDQWT). Texture features are extracted from transform domain images using local neighborhood patterns. The feature vectors are applied to five popular classifiers and performance metrics are estimated. A comparative analysis of these methods shows best classification performance (accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, F-score) for gradient directional pattern (GDP) and noise resistant local binary pattern (NRLBP) based feature vectors extracted from combined magnitude and phase components of NDQWT transformed images. To the best of our knowledge, this methodology of feature extraction from combined phase and magnitude components of NDQWT transformed images is novel and efficient when compared with traditional methods.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60094056","afid":"60094056","affilname":"Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Kerala","affiliation-city":"Kottayam","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013109","afid":"60013109","affilname":"Kerala Agricultural University","affiliation-city":"Thrissur","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221590966","authid":"57221590966","authname":"Mathew D.","surname":"Mathew","given-name":"Deepthy","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60094056"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209798252","authid":"57209798252","orcid":"0000-0002-1008-7467","authname":"Kumar C.S.","surname":"Kumar","given-name":"C.

The main goal of these methods is to make objective evaluation flexible enough to accommodate the influence of any new visual distortion. The research provides a rapid approach for quality assessment of color photographs based on this concept by altering the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) index in a neutrosophic environment. The SSIM family is a set of parameters that have demonstrated a promising approach in the analysis of reference picture tasks. The current study deals with the exploitation of the concept to use Single-Valued Neutrosophic Sets (SVNSs) for evaluating image quality. Neutrosophic divergence was being constructed for an image and its comparison with other SSIM is presented. Resultantly, a correlation was observed between the proposed divergence and SSIM, which gave accurate informatics. Additionally, the results were presented on a real line which reflects clear information on image convergence and divergence. The uncertainty in the allocation of membership is called the hesitation degree, fuzzy sets have gained a lot of traction in numerous domains of signal and image processing. Based on generalized exponential fuzzy entropy, a trustworthy Image Quality Assessment is proposed.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60194949","afid":"60194949","affilname":"Khwaja Fareed University of Engineering &amp; Information Technology","affiliation-city":"Rahim Yar Khan","affiliation-country":"Pakistan"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073547","afid":"60073547","affilname":"Anhui Jianzhu University","affiliation-city":"Hefei","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57918539500","authid":"57918539500","orcid":"0000-0002-9620-7692","authname":"Liu J.B.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Jia Bao","initials":"J.B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073547"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194728192","authid":"57194728192","orcid":"0000-0002-0392-5901","authname":"Salamat N.","surname":"Salamat","given-name":"Nadeem","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60194949"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216754656","authid":"57216754656","orcid":"0000-0002-2358-178X","authname":"Kamran M.","surname":"Kamran","given-name":"Muhammad","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60194949"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202914374","authid":"57202914374","orcid":"0000-0002-8616-8829","authname":"Ashraf S.","surname":"Ashraf","given-name":"Shahzaib","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60194949"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57395797700","authid":"57395797700","orcid":"0000-0002-6142-9826","authname":"Khan R.H.","surname":"Khan","given-name":"Riaz Hussain","initials":"R.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60194949"}]}],"authkeywords":"Fuzzy Entropy | Image Quality Evaluation | Structural Similarity","article-number":"2340074","source-id":"28472","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherhybridgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Hybrid Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149856800"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149856800?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149856800&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149856800&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149856800","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85149856800","eid":"2-s2.0-85149856800","dc:title":"Incremental Quaternion Random Neural Networks","dc:creator":"Cui X.","prism:publicationName":"Communications in Computer and Information Science","prism:issn":"18650929","prism:eIssn":"18650937","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789819906161"}],"prism:volume":"1787 CCIS","prism:pageRange":"174-191","prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-981-99-0617-8_13","dc:description":"Quaternion, as a hypercomplex number with three imaginary elements, is effective in characterizing three- and four-dimensional vector signals. Quaternion neural networks with randomly generated quaternions as the hidden node parameters become attractive for the good learning capability and generalization performance. In this paper, a novel incremental quaternion random neural network trained by extreme learning machine (IQ-ELM) is proposed. To fully exploit the second-order Q-properness statistic of quaternion random variables, the augmented quaternion vector is further applied in IQ-ELM (IAQ-ELM) for hypercomplex data learning. The network is constructed by gradually adding the hidden neuron one-by-one, where the output weight is optimized by minimizing the residual error based on the fundamental of the generalized HR calculus (GHR) of quaternion variable function. Experiments on multidimensional chaotic system regression, aircraft trajectory tracking, face and image recognition are conducted to show the effectiveness of IQ-ELM and IAQ-ELM. Comparisons to two popular quaternion RNNs, Schmidt NN (SNN) and random vector functional-link net (RVFL), are also provided to show the feasibility and superiority of using quaternions in RNN for incremental learning.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60180341","afid":"60180341","affilname":"Centre Borelli","affiliation-city":"Gif-sur-Yvette","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60133174","afid":"60133174","affilname":"Shenzhen University Health Science Center","affiliation-city":"Shenzhen","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013614","afid":"60013614","affilname":"Hangzhou Dianzi University","affiliation-city":"Hangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222611490","authid":"57222611490","authname":"Cui X.","surname":"Cui","given-name":"Xiaonan","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013614"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193515024","authid":"57193515024","authname":"Wang T.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Tianlei","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013614"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57840745800","authid":"57840745800","authname":"Chen H.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Hao","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013614"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26422280400","authid":"26422280400","authname":"Lei B.","surname":"Lei","given-name":"Baiying","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60133174"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101682045","authid":"7101682045","authname":"Vidal P.P.","surname":"Vidal","given-name":"Pierre Paul","initials":"P.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013614"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60180341"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35274436100","authid":"35274436100","authname":"Cao J.","surname":"Cao","given-name":"Jiuwen","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013614"}]}],"authkeywords":"Augmented quaternion | Generalized HR calculus | Incremental ELM | Quaternion algebra | Quaternion split activation function","source-id":"17700155007","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"2021MC0AB04","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149677600"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149677600?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149677600&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149677600&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149677600","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85149677600","eid":"2-s2.0-85149677600","dc:title":"Quaternionic Wavelets for Estimating Forest Biomass by Gradient Boosting Methods","dc:creator":"Mfopou A.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering, LNICST","prism:issn":"18678211","prism:eIssn":"1867822X","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783031252709"}],"prism:volume":"459 LNICST","prism:pageRange":"239-250","prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-25271-6_15","dc:description":"The AGB estimation is an vital issue inside the system of lessening Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (UNCCC REDD system). This question is even more troublesome for tropical area which endure from the deficiency of exact data from forest inventories on the ground and above all from the complexity of the forests. This problem can be addressed by satellite remote sensing as very high spatial resolution optical images giving data on forest structure through canopy grain texture analysis are becoming increasingly available. The FOTO (FOurier Texture Ordination) method has stood out for its relevance for predicting forest biomass in a few tropical regions. It employments PCA and linear regression, and in this work we propose a unused texture classifier based on the quaternionic wavelet transform (QWT). This recent transform isolates the data contained in an image more efficiently than previous methods and gives a multi-scale analysis whose coefficients are 2D analytic, with almost translationally invariant amplitude and phase, composed of three angles. The use and interpretation of QWT coefficients, in particular phase, are covered, and we show a texture classifier that uses both amplitude and phase.

First, the input color image is preprocessed to form a secondary image. The secondary image is subjected to fast quaternion generic polar complex exponential transform to obtain the mixed low-order moment coefficients as the global features of the image. Second, the algorithm extracts energy change features on the edges of the secondary image and energy point features in the center of the image as energy features of the image under the YCbCr color space. Finally, the image's mixed low-order moment and energy features are combined and scrambled to form the final hash sequence. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm balances robustness and differentiation well. Moreover, the hash sequence is the shortest, and the algorithm has better check-all and check-accuracy rates compared with other algorithms in the copy detection experiments.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60082199","afid":"60082199","affilname":"Shanghai University of Electric Power","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58130631500","authid":"58130631500","orcid":"0000-0002-3247-4337","authname":"Yan Z.","surname":"Yan","given-name":"Zhao","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60082199"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58130596600","authid":"58130596600","authname":"Jie B.","surname":"Jie","given-name":"Bai","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60082199"}]}],"authkeywords":"copy detection | image energy | image hashing | polar complex exponential transformation","article-number":"013009","source-id":"25978","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61802250","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149423370"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149423370?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149423370&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149423370&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149423370","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85149423370","eid":"2-s2.0-85149423370","dc:title":"Learning Speech Emotion Representations in the Quaternion Domain","dc:creator":"Guizzo E.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio Speech and Language Processing","prism:issn":"23299290","prism:eIssn":"23299304","prism:volume":"31","prism:pageRange":"1200-1212","prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2023.3250840","dc:description":"The modeling of human emotion expression in speech signals is an important, yet challenging task. The high resource demand of speech emotion recognition models, combined with the general scarcity of emotion-labelled data are obstacles to the development and application of effective solutions in this field. In this paper, we present an approach to jointly circumvent these difficulties. Our method, named RH-emo, is a novel semi-supervised architecture aimed at extracting quaternion embeddings from real-valued monoaural spectrograms, enabling the use of quaternion-valued networks for speech emotion recognition tasks. RH-emo is a hybrid real/quaternion autoencoder network that consists of a real-valued encoder in parallel to a real-valued emotion classifier and a quaternion-valued decoder. On the one hand, the classifier permits to optimization of each latent axis of the embeddings for the classification of a specific emotion-related characteristic: valence, arousal, dominance, and overall emotion. On the other hand, quaternion reconstruction enables the latent dimension to develop intra-channel correlations that are required for an effective representation as a quaternion entity. We test our approach on speech emotion recognition tasks using four popular datasets: IEMOCAP, RAVDESS, EmoDB, and TESS, comparing the performance of three well-established real-valued CNN architectures (AlexNet, ResNet-50, VGG) and their quaternion-valued equivalent fed with the embeddings created with RH-emo. We obtain a consistent improvement in the test accuracy for all datasets, while drastically reducing the resources' demand of models. Moreover, we performed additional experiments and ablation studies that confirm the effectiveness of our approach.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033387","afid":"60033387","affilname":"University of London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032350","afid":"60032350","affilname":"Sapienza Università di Roma","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57210359479","authid":"57210359479","orcid":"0000-0002-2857-4140","authname":"Guizzo E.","surname":"Guizzo","given-name":"Eric","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033387"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24476899500","authid":"24476899500","orcid":"0000-0001-8028-9905","authname":"Weyde T.","surname":"Weyde","given-name":"Tillman","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033387"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55772102700","authid":"55772102700","orcid":"0000-0003-0881-8344","authname":"Scardapane S.","surname":"Scardapane","given-name":"Simone","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36444807900","authid":"36444807900","orcid":"0000-0003-4067-4504","authname":"Comminiello D.","surname":"Comminiello","given-name":"Danilo","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]}],"authkeywords":"quaternion algebra | quaternion neural networks | Speech emotion recognition | transferable embeddings","source-id":"21100368801","fund-no":"RG11916B88E1942F","fund-sponsor":"Sapienza Università di Roma","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherhybridgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Hybrid Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149374060"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149374060?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149374060&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149374060&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149374060","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85149374060","eid":"2-s2.0-85149374060","dc:title":"Towards quaternion quadratic-phase Fourier transform","dc:creator":"Younus Bhat M.","prism:publicationName":"Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences","prism:issn":"01704214","prism:eIssn":"10991476","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1002/mma.9126","dc:description":"The quadratic-phase Fourier transform (QPFT) is a neoteric addition to the class of integral transforms and embodies a variety of signal processing tools like the Fourier, fractional Fourier, linear canonical, and special affine Fourier transform. In this paper, we generalize the quadratic-phase Fourier transform to quaternion-valued signals, known as the quaternion quadratic-phase Fourier transform (Q-QPFT). We initiate our investigation by studying the QPFT of 2D quaternionic signals, and later on, we introduce the Q-QPFT of 2D quaternionic signals. Using the fundamental relationship between the Q-QPFT and quaternion Fourier transform (QFT), we derive the inversion, Parseval's, and Plancherel's formulae associated with the Q-QPFT. Some other properties including linearity, shift, and modulation of the Q-QPFT are also studied. Finally, we formulate several classes of uncertainty principles (UPs) for the Q-QPFT like Heisenberg-type UP, logarithmic UP, Hardy's UP, Beurling's UP, and Donoho–Stark's UP. This study can be regarded as the first step in the applications of the Q-QPFT in the real world.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60115213","afid":"60115213","affilname":"Islamic University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Awantipora","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56747301000","authid":"56747301000","orcid":"0000-0002-3369-0883","authname":"Younus Bhat M.","surname":"Younus Bhat","given-name":"Mohammad","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60115213"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58127273900","authid":"58127273900","orcid":"0000-0001-5124-2761","authname":"Hamid Dar A.","surname":"Hamid Dar","given-name":"Aamir","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60115213"}]}],"authkeywords":"Donoho–Stark | inversion | modulation | Parseval's formula | quaternion quadratic-phase Fourier transform | uncertainty principle","source-id":"24594","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149359191"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149359191?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149359191&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149359191&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149359191","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85149359191","eid":"2-s2.0-85149359191","dc:title":"Quaternion Extreme Learning Machine Based on Real Augmented Representation","dc:creator":"Zhang H.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","prism:issn":"10709908","prism:eIssn":"15582361","prism:volume":"30","prism:pageRange":"175-179","prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1109/LSP.2023.3246396","dc:description":"Widely linear modeling is an important quaternion signal processing technique for capturing the complete second-order statistics of quaternion signals. However, the algorithms based on widely linear modeling are computationally expensive due to the augmented variables and statistics. In this letter, a fast estimation technique based on a real augmented representation of widely linear modeling is proposed in the context of quaternion extreme learning machine with augmented hidden layer (QELMAH), resulting in a reduction of almost 93% of multiplications and 75% of additions. An equivalence between the proposed algorithm and the original QELMAH is theoretically established by proving that the trained networks with the proposed algorithm and the original one mathematically implement identical mapping. Such a technique is also applicable to the widely linear quaternion recursive least squares algorithm. The theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms are validated by simulations on two benchmark problems.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029322","afid":"60029322","affilname":"Dalian Maritime University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009509","afid":"60009509","affilname":"Northeast Normal University","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/129256441","afid":"129256441","affilname":"Honor Network Limited Company","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35933005200","authid":"35933005200","orcid":"0000-0001-7394-7295","authname":"Zhang H.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Huisheng","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029322"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58127344100","authid":"58127344100","authname":"Wang Z.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Zaiqiang","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029322"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58046129300","authid":"58046129300","authname":"Chen D.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Dehao","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029322"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216947143","authid":"57216947143","authname":"Zhu S.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Shuai","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"129256441"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23394265800","authid":"23394265800","orcid":"0000-0002-3645-6486","authname":"Xu D.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Dongpo","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009509"}]}],"authkeywords":"Quaternion extreme learning machine | real augmented representation | second-order statistics | widely linear estimation","source-id":"17316","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61671099","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149248575"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149248575?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149248575&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149248575&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149248575","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85149248575","eid":"2-s2.0-85149248575","dc:title":"Quaternion discrete orthogonal Hahn moments convolutional neural network for color image classification and face recognition","dc:creator":"El Alami A.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","prism:issn":"13807501","prism:eIssn":"15737721","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11042-023-14866-4","dc:description":"Color image recognition has recently attracted more researchers’ attention. Many methods based on quaternions have been developed to improve the classification accuracies. Some approaches have currently used quaternions with convolutional neural network (CNN). Despite the obtained results, these approaches have some weakness such as the computational complexity. In fact, the large size of the input color images necessitates a high number of layers and parameters during the learning process which can generate errors calculation and hence influence the recognition rate. In this paper, a new architecture called quaternion discrete orthogonal Hahn moments convolutional neural network (QHMCNN) for color image classification and face recognition is proposed to reduce the computational complexity of CNN while improving the classification rate. The quaternion Hahn moments are used to extract pertinent and compact features from images and introduced them in quaternion convolutional neural network. Experimental simulations conducted on various databases are demonstrated the performance of the proposed architecture QHMCNN against other relevant methods in state-of-the-art and the robustness under different noise conditions.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019337","afid":"60019337","affilname":"Mohammed V University in Rabat","affiliation-city":"Rabat","affiliation-country":"Morocco"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017021","afid":"60017021","affilname":"Université Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah","affiliation-city":"Fez","affiliation-country":"Morocco"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57207620611","authid":"57207620611","orcid":"0000-0002-2489-661X","authname":"El Alami A.","surname":"El Alami","given-name":"Abdelmajid","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017021"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202669582","authid":"57202669582","authname":"Mesbah A.","surname":"Mesbah","given-name":"Abderrahim","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019337"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209135926","authid":"57209135926","authname":"Berrahou N.","surname":"Berrahou","given-name":"Nadia","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017021"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194200184","authid":"57194200184","authname":"Lakhili Z.","surname":"Lakhili","given-name":"Zouhir","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017021"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35772551600","authid":"35772551600","authname":"Berrahou A.","surname":"Berrahou","given-name":"Aissam","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019337"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12144280900","authid":"12144280900","authname":"Qjidaa H.","surname":"Qjidaa","given-name":"Hassan","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017021"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image classification | Complexity | Face recognition | Noise condition | Quaternion convolutional neural network | Quaternion Hahn moments | Quaternion representation","source-id":"25627","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149024819"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149024819?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149024819&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149024819&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149024819","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85149024819","eid":"2-s2.0-85149024819","dc:title":"A novel diffusivity function-based image denoising for MRI medical images","dc:creator":"Kollem S.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","prism:issn":"13807501","prism:eIssn":"15737721","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11042-023-14457-3","dc:description":"Medical imaging is essential for accurate diagnosis. In medical imaging, various algorithms for image denoising have been developed. However, some drawbacks have been identified, including the blocking effect, which results in excessive smoothing of the images, and the loss of image detail. To generate noise on images, this article used Poisson noise. We propose a new diffusivity function-based partial differential equation method used for image denoising with the aid of exploiting the statistical properties of observed noisy images. This model involves a Quaternion Wavelet Transform, which is responsible for creating the different coefficients of a noisy image. Utilizing the soft threshold function, an improved generalized cross-validation function is responsible for determining the best threshold value. This optimal threshold value is then used to control the diffusion process by means of a new diffusivity function. Here, we introduce the fourth-order partial differential equation diffusivity function, an unique diffusion coefficient that is more effective than earlier approaches at eliminating noise and maintaining edges. Finally, the experiments of the proposed method are measured using the peak signal-to-noise ratio (42.78 dBs), mean square error (3.4206), structural similarity index (99.645 %), and standard error (peak signal-to-noise ratio (40.677 dBs), mean square error (5.867), and structural similarity index (97.978 %)) as well as compared to the results of other conventional image denoising techniques (improved partial differential equation-based total variation model, Generalization cross-validation with diffusivity function, non-linear nonlocal diffusion equation, Efficient anisotropic diffusion model, and Hessian matrix-based fourth-order anisotropic diffusion filter). The proposed method produces superior qualitative and quantitative results. The MATLAB R2020a version was used to analyze the results.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60114867","afid":"60114867","affilname":"SR University","affiliation-city":"Warangal","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60114590","afid":"60114590","affilname":"G.

It also describes the complementary relationship between the level of development of information technologies and the efficiency of malicious software. Mathematics is developing towards generalisation of the image of main objects and the properties of sets. And if, in a primitive sense, symmetry actually means an equality in the simplest case of a three-dimensional functional on argument values equally spaced from a direct line (hyperplane) or a multiple expression of such functional, then, as the mathematical apparatus develops, we first come to the conjugates of a solution space of related sets. This is, for example, an ordinary complex conjugate on a set of complex numbers. Further generalisation, for example, on hypercomplex numbers gives rise to both a number of independent sections conjugated to this one according to a hyperort and a new tone to a non-trivial conjugate number. Further development of symmetry concepts is the consideration of almost symmetric or complementary structures. A conjugation occurs when applying the apparatus of almost periodic functions to the considered set of characteristics of an object in order to determine its prognostic behaviour.

Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have boosted the accuracy of ASC algorithms. However, the focus of ASC system designers has shifted from improving accuracy to incorporating real-world considerations like device robustness and model complexity. In this paper, we address the problem of developing a low complexity system for ASC which can generalize across multiple recording devices. We propose to employ residual quaternion CNNs for low complexity, device-robust ASC. The proposed model RQNet uses quaternion encoding to increase the accuracy with fewer parameters. To further enhance the performance of RQNet, we employ a variant of log-mel spectrogram called multi-scale mel spectrogram (ms2) to represent the acoustic signal. Experiments on two benchmark ASC datasets indicate that RQNet outperforms a log-mel spectrum-based baseline by more than twofold. In addition, it has a good measure of separability between the individual classes, as indicated by an AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) scores of 0.906 and 0.994. Furthermore, it reduces the model size by 82.19&#x0025; and floating-point operations by 23.25&#x0025;. Consequently, RQNet is suitable for deployment in context-aware devices.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60111839","afid":"60111839","affilname":"APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University, Kerela","affiliation-city":"Thiruvananthapuram","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60069504","afid":"60069504","affilname":"College of Engineering Trivandrum","affiliation-city":"Thiruvananthapuram","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55437178800","authid":"55437178800","authname":"Madhu A.","surname":"Madhu","given-name":"Aswathy","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069504"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57305155800","authid":"57305155800","authname":"K S.","surname":"K","given-name":"Suresh","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60111839"}]}],"authkeywords":"Acoustics | Complexity theory | Convolutional neural networks | DCASE | Device robust ASC | Feature extraction | Low Complexity ASC | Performance evaluation | Quaternion CNN | Quaternions | Residual CNN | Spectrogram | Wavelet Transform","source-id":"16211","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85148442624"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85148442624?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85148442624&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85148442624&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85148442624","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85148442624","eid":"2-s2.0-85148442624","dc:title":"Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection Using Reconstruction Fusion of Quaternion Frequency Domain Analysis","dc:creator":"Tu B.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","prism:issn":"2162237X","prism:eIssn":"21622388","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3227167","dc:description":"Most existing techniques consider hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) as background modeling and anomaly search problems in the spatial domain. In this article, we model the background in the frequency domain and treat anomaly detection as a frequency-domain analysis problem. We illustrate that spikes in the amplitude spectrum correspond to the background, and a Gaussian low-pass filter performing on the amplitude spectrum is equivalent to an anomaly detector. The initial anomaly detection map is obtained by the reconstruction with the filtered amplitude and the raw phase spectrum. To further suppress the nonanomaly high-frequency detailed information, we illustrate that the phase spectrum is critical information to perceive the spatial saliency of anomalies. The saliency-aware map obtained by phase-only reconstruction (POR) is used to enhance the initial anomaly map, which realizes a significant improvement in background suppression. In addition to the standard Fourier transform (FT), we adopt the quaternion FT (QFT) for conducting multiscale and multifeature processing in a parallel way, to obtain the frequency domain representation of the hyperspectral images (HSIs). This helps with robust detection performance. Experimental results on four real HSIs validate the remarkable detection performance and excellent time efficiency of our proposed approach when compared to some state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073729","afid":"60073729","affilname":"Hunan Institute of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Yueyang","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017838","afid":"60017838","affilname":"Universidad de Extremadura","affiliation-city":"Badajoz","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006019","afid":"60006019","affilname":"China University of Geosciences","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193831035","authid":"57193831035","authname":"Tu B.","surname":"Tu","given-name":"Bing","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073729"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203501161","authid":"57203501161","authname":"Yang X.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Xianchang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073729"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56386537700","authid":"56386537700","authname":"He W.","surname":"He","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073729"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24481713500","authid":"24481713500","authname":"Li J.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Jun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006019"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006613644","authid":"7006613644","authname":"Plaza A.","surname":"Plaza","given-name":"Antonio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017838"}]}],"authkeywords":"Anomaly detection | Anomaly detection | Detectors | Feature extraction | frequency domain analysis | Frequency-domain analysis | hyperspectral image (HSI) | Hyperspectral imaging | Image reconstruction | quaternion Fourier transform (QFT) | Quaternions","source-id":"21100235616","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85147988813"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85147988813?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85147988813&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85147988813&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85147988813","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85147988813","eid":"2-s2.0-85147988813","dc:title":"Data encryption based on a 9D complex chaotic system with quaternion for smart grid","dc:creator":"Zhang F.","prism:publicationName":"Chinese Physics B","prism:issn":"16741056","prism:eIssn":"20583834","prism:volume":"32","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 January 2023","prism:doi":"10.1088/1674-1056/ac76b2","dc:description":"With the development of smart grid, operation and control of a power system can be realized through the power communication network, especially the power production and enterprise management business involve a large amount of sensitive information, and the requirements for data security and real-time transmission are gradually improved.

However, like traditional single-component acquisition, multicomponent seismic data acquisition also encounters sparse and irregular sampling problems. The conventional reconstruction methods treat multicomponent data as independent components and recover the missing traces in a component-by-component manner. These componentwise approaches ignore the internal mutual relationships among different components and damage the vector characteristics of the seismic wavefield. Quaternion algebra provides an effective vector representation tool for multicomponent data. Upon that, we present a new vector Projection Onto Convex Sets (POCS) method with biquaternion Fourier transform to reconstruct the irregularly missing traces of 3-D and three-component (3-D-3C) seismic data. Compared to the current real-valued quaternion reconstruction methods implemented in the time domain, the proposed method performed in the frequency domain can fully maintain the conjugate symmetry property of the biquaternion data and only reconstruct the positive or negative frequency slices of the observed 3-D-3C data. Besides, the new method can simultaneously interpolate the 3C or 4C data with different missing patterns. We compare the proposed vector POCS method with the scalar POCS method through experiments with a synthetic 3-D-3C dataset and a field 3-D-3C volume. Both experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60172276","afid":"60172276","affilname":"School of Geophysics and Information Technology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030835","afid":"60030835","affilname":"University of Alberta","affiliation-city":"Edmonton","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004598","afid":"60004598","affilname":"China National Petroleum Corporation","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58088834900","authid":"58088834900","orcid":"0000-0001-7058-6295","authname":"Li F.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Fan","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60172276"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192650440","authid":"57192650440","orcid":"0000-0003-2720-0670","authname":"Gao J.","surname":"Gao","given-name":"Jianjun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60172276"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203080832","authid":"57203080832","orcid":"0000-0001-6654-6661","authname":"Sacchi M.D.","surname":"Sacchi","given-name":"Mauricio D.","initials":"M.D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55701392200","authid":"55701392200","orcid":"0000-0001-9027-1637","authname":"Lu J.","surname":"Lu","given-name":"Jun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60172276"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56295370600","authid":"56295370600","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yun","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60172276"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188839466","authid":"57188839466","authname":"Chen H.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Haifeng","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004598"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58088702000","authid":"58088702000","authname":"Li C.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Chaolin","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004598"}]}],"authkeywords":"Biquaternions | multicomponent seismic exploration | seismic data vector reconstruction | vector Projection Onto Convex Sets (POCS)","article-number":"5902316","source-id":"17360","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85147277144"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85147277144?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85147277144&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85147277144&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85147277144","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85147277144","eid":"2-s2.0-85147277144","dc:title":"Quaternion Relation Embedding for Scene Graph Generation","dc:creator":"Wang Z.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","prism:issn":"15209210","prism:eIssn":"19410077","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1109/TMM.2023.3239229","dc:description":"As an important visual understanding task, scene graph generation has been drawing widespread attention and could boost a broad range of downstream vision applications. Traditional scene graph generation methods based on different context refinements are trained with probabilistic chain rule, which treats objects and relationships as independent entities. Despite their surprisingly great progress, such a plain formulation unconsciously ignores the latent geometric structure of entities and relationships. To address this issue, we move beyond the traditional real-valued representations and use <underline>Quat</underline>ernion <underline>R</underline>elation <underline>E</underline>mbedding (QuatRE) to generate scene graphs with more expressive hypercomplex representations. More specifically, we introduce the concept of quaternion representations, hyper-complex valued with three imaginary components for objects entities, then formulate the relation triplets with Hamilton product. Benefiting from explicitly modeling the latent inter-dependencies among all imaginary components and strong expressive capacity, our proposed QuatRE method could better capture the interactions between entities. More importantly, our novel QuatRE method can be treated as a plug-in and well generalized into other methods for performance improvement as it involves no additional layers. Finally, extensive comparisons of our proposed method against the state-of-the-art methods on two large-scale and widely-used datasets, i.e. Visual Genome and Open Images, demonstrated our superiority and generalization capability on various metrics for biased or unbiased inference.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005465","afid":"60005465","affilname":"University of Electronic Science and Technology of China","affiliation-city":"Chengdu","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56532885200","authid":"56532885200","authname":"Wang Z.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Zheng","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55647047300","authid":"55647047300","authname":"Xu X.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Xing","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56467514700","authid":"56467514700","authname":"Wang G.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Guoqing","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222954946","authid":"57222954946","authname":"Yang Y.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Yang","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404523209","authid":"7404523209","authname":"Shen H.T.","surname":"Shen","given-name":"Heng Tao","initials":"H.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]}],"authkeywords":"Context modeling | Hamilton Product | Interaction Modeling | Portable computers | Quaternion Space | Quaternions | Scene Graph Generation | Semantics | Task analysis | Transformers | Visual Relation Detection | Visualization","source-id":"16211","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85147266578"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85147266578?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85147266578&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85147266578&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85147266578","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85147266578","eid":"2-s2.0-85147266578","dc:title":"Color Image Edge Detection Method Based on the Improved Whale Optimization Algorithm","dc:creator":"Liu D.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Access","prism:eIssn":"21693536","prism:volume":"11","prism:pageRange":"5981-5989","prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3236761","dc:description":"A high level of computation is required for edge detection in color images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to address issues, such as noise, distortion, and information loss.

In this method, the color image pixels are represented by quaternions, and the global random position variables and information exchange mechanism are introduced into the random walk foraging formula of the WOA. Further, a random disturbance factor is also introduced into the predator-prey formula of the spiral bubble net. The proposed improved WOA is then used to obtain the preliminary edge of the UAV-captured color image. An edge-point classification method using the radius of the shortest distance between the whale and the current global optimum in each iteration is presented to enhance a preliminary edge.

Different from traditional quaternion norm approximations that are always the single objective models (SOM), QSVND is adopted to transform the SOM into the bi-objective model (BOM). Furthermore, regularization is used to solve the BOM problem as a common scalarization method, which converts the BOM into a more reasonable SOM. This can handle over-fitting or under-fitting problems neglected in this kind of research for quaternion representation (QR) in color image processing. That is how to treat redundancy caused by the extra scalar part when the vector part of a quaternion is used to represent a color pixel. We apply QSVND to quaternion principal component analysis (QPCA) for color face recognition (FR), which can deal with the phenomenon of under-fitting of vector part norm approximation. Comparisons with the competing approaches on AR, FERET, FEI, and KDEF&AKDEF databases consistently show the superiority of the proposed approach for color FR.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60122420","afid":"60122420","affilname":"Shandong University of Finance and Economics","affiliation-city":"Jinan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60108756","afid":"60108756","affilname":"Hubei University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028009","afid":"60028009","affilname":"Yunnan University","affiliation-city":"Kunming","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57218182246","authid":"57218182246","orcid":"0000-0003-4391-8068","authname":"Liu W.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Wankai","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122420"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003837546","authid":"7003837546","orcid":"0000-0003-1924-9087","authname":"Kou K.I.","surname":"Kou","given-name":"Kit Ian","initials":"K.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201452670","authid":"57201452670","orcid":"0000-0001-5663-8749","authname":"Miao J.","surname":"Miao","given-name":"Jifei","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028009"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194203866","authid":"57194203866","authname":"Cai Z.","surname":"Cai","given-name":"Zhenfeng","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60108756"}]}],"authkeywords":"color face recognition | principal component analysis | Quaternion scalar and vector norm decomposition | regularization","source-id":"25534","fund-acr":"HBUT","fund-no":"LY20A020003","fund-sponsor":"Hubei University of Technology","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85144494120"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85144494120?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85144494120&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85144494120&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85144494120","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85144494120","eid":"2-s2.0-85144494120","dc:title":"Center3dAugNet: Effect of Rotation Representation on One-Stage Joint Car Detection and 6D-Pose Estimation","dc:creator":"Belkin I.","prism:publicationName":"Studies in Computational Intelligence","prism:issn":"1860949X","prism:eIssn":"18609503","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783031190315"}],"prism:volume":"1064 SCI","prism:pageRange":"330-342","prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-19032-2_35","dc:description":"Joint car detection and 6D-pose estimation on monocular images is a topic of active research.

Traditional small video satellite imaging tracking method requires the priori position information of the target and cannot observe non-cooperative ground targets. To remedy the deficiency, this paper designs a video image-based method which performs attitude adjustment based on the projection of the target in the image plane. Firstly, this paper establishes a camera model to reveal the principle of small video satellite perspective imaging; The spacecraft attitude kinematic model expressed in quaternion form and the spacecraft attitude dynamics model under the rigid body assumption are introduced; Then, the satellite attitude error and angular velocity error are calculated based on the deviation of the target real-time pixel coordinates from the desired projected position, and the error quaternion and error angular velocity are used as control feedback. In order to counteract the effects of torque disturbance and rotational inertia uncertainty on the satellite visual tracking control, a fast response overshoot-free sliding mode tracking controller without relying on the accurate model of the satellite is designed. The LaSalle invariance principle are used to demonstrate the asymptotic stability of the control system. Numerical simulation proves that the designed controller can effectively accomplish the visual tracking control of ground targets and has strong robustness against torque disturbances.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60089786","afid":"60089786","affilname":"Beijing Institute of Tracking and Telecommunication Technology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024350","afid":"60024350","affilname":"National University of Defense Technology China","affiliation-city":"Changsha","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57733177300","authid":"57733177300","authname":"Wang M.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Mengmeng","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57732929000","authid":"57732929000","authname":"Song C.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Chao","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34881731300","authid":"34881731300","authname":"Fan C.","surname":"Fan","given-name":"Caizhi","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58020565200","authid":"58020565200","authname":"Zhang Y.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Yonghe","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60089786"}]}],"authkeywords":"Ground target | Sliding mode control | Small video satellite | Visual tracking control","source-id":"19700186822","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
