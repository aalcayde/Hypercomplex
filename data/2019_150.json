Quaternionic representation (QR), a popular technique for color image processing, is capable of considering the interactions among color channels. However, some commonly used quaternionic operators, such as Clifford translation, rotation, and reflection, only explore the shallow relationships among different color channels. To address this limitation, we propose a simple yet effective operator, named Multiple-Action Transform of Quaternion (MATQ), for color images. MATQ cascades some basic quaternionic operators to form a multiple architecture such that it is able to take account of more complicated relationships among color channels. Three examples of MATQ operators are given and detailedly investigated. Two applications, impulse noise detection and image classification of color images, are provided to show the effectiveness of MATQ. Experiments and comparisons demonstrate that the developed MATQ is a useful tool for color image processing.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024542","afid":"60024542","affilname":"South China University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008919","afid":"60008919","affilname":"Guilin University of Electronic Technology","affiliation-city":"Guilin","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006356","afid":"60006356","affilname":"Guilin University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Guilin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35146229200","authid":"35146229200","orcid":"0000-0002-9488-8236","authname":"Lan R.","surname":"Lan","given-name":"Rushi","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024542"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008919"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57208692864","authid":"57208692864","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiaoqin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008919"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8717165700","authid":"8717165700","authname":"Xie X.","surname":"Xie","given-name":"Xiaolan","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006356"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006356"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57207778087","authid":"57207778087","authname":"Lu L.","surname":"Lu","given-name":"Linfa","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008919"}]}],"authkeywords":"Classification | Color image processing | Impulse detection | Multiple-action transform | Quaternionic representation (QR)","article-number":"8819965","source-id":"21100374601","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"GIIP201703","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85078302782"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85078302782?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85078302782&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85078302782&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85078302782","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85078302782","eid":"2-s2.0-85078302782","dc:title":"An Extended Multilayer Perceptron Model Using Reduced Geometric Algebra","dc:creator":"Li Y.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Access","prism:eIssn":"21693536","prism:volume":"7","prism:pageRange":"129815-129823","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","prism:doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2940217","dc:description":"An extended model of multilayer perceptron (MLP) based on reduced geometric algebra (RGA), namely RGA-MLP, is proposed for multi-dimensional signal processing.

This process will deteriorate the original image, so it is not suitable for medical images. In order to overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a geometrically invariant color medical image null-watermarking scheme based on quaternion polar harmonic Fourier moments (QPHFM), which achieves the copyright protection without changing the original medical image. First, a high-precision QPHFM computation method based on wavelet numerical integration is designed, which can effectively improve the computation precision. Then based on the precise QPHFM (PQPHFM) and chaotic map, a robust null-watermarking scheme for color medical images is proposed to protect the copyright of color medical images. This scheme uses the PQPHFM to construct feature images and its good stability and geometric invariance make the proposed null-watermarking scheme has good robustness and resistance against geometric attacks.

The performance of the proposed scheme is superior to that of similar robust null-watermarking schemes and other color medical image watermarking schemes.","citedby-count":"34","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60102098","afid":"60102098","affilname":"Shenyang Institute of Engineering","affiliation-city":"Shenyang","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029322","afid":"60029322","affilname":"Dalian Maritime University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011592","afid":"60011592","affilname":"Qilu University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Jinan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004538","afid":"60004538","affilname":"Dalian University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/123035544","afid":"123035544","affilname":"Liaoning Geology Mineral Group Energy Geology Co.

In order to construct a ξ-norm, QVDHNNs system are decomposed into four real-number systems according to Hamilton rules. Then, taking advantage of ξ-norms, inequality technique and Cauchy's test for convergence, time-invariant delays and time-varying delays are considered successively to derive ξ-exponential type sufficient conditions. Based on these, several corollaries about the existence, uniqueness and exponential stability of solutions are obtained. Finally, two numerical examples with time-invariant delays and time-varying delays are given respectively.

Most existing linear regression based methods are devised for grayscale image based face recognition and fail to exploit the color information of color face images. To extend linear regression for color images, we propose a novel color face recognition method by formulating the color face recognition problem as a quaternion linear regression model. The proposed quaternion linear regression classification (QLRC) algorithm models each color facial image as a quaternion signal and codes multiple channels of each query color image in a holistic manner. Thus, the correlation among distinct channels of each color image is well preserved and leveraged by QLRC to further improve the recognition performance. To further improve QLRC, we propose a quaternion collaborative representation optimized classifier (QCROC) which integrates QLRC and quaternion collaborative representation based classifier into a unified framework. The experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approaches for color face recognition.","citedby-count":"14","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60102085","afid":"60102085","affilname":"Chengdu University","affiliation-city":"Chengdu","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031419","afid":"60031419","affilname":"Ningbo University","affiliation-city":"Ningbo","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008576","afid":"60008576","affilname":"Foshan University","affiliation-city":"Foshan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188872929","authid":"57188872929","authname":"Zou C.","surname":"Zou","given-name":"Cuiming","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102085"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003837546","authid":"7003837546","orcid":"0000-0003-1924-9087","authname":"Kou K.I.","surname":"Kou","given-name":"Kit Ian","initials":"K.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55946301100","authid":"55946301100","authname":"Dong L.","surname":"Dong","given-name":"Li","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031419"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56972874700","authid":"56972874700","authname":"Zheng X.","surname":"Zheng","given-name":"Xianwei","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008576"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404591899","authid":"7404591899","authname":"Tang Y.Y.","surname":"Tang","given-name":"Yuan Yan","initials":"Y.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]}],"authkeywords":"color image | face recognition | linear regression | Quaternion representation","article-number":"8878967","source-id":"21100374601","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61672114","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077742355"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077742355?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077742355&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077742355&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077742355","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85077742355","eid":"2-s2.0-85077742355","dc:title":"Combined quaternion-based error state kalman filtering and smooth variable structure filtering for robust attitude estimation","dc:creator":"Youn W.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Access","prism:eIssn":"21693536","prism:volume":"7","prism:pageRange":"148989-149004","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","prism:doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2946609","dc:description":"This paper presents a novel robust quaternion-based error state Kalman filter (ESKF) for coping with modeling uncertainty in inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based attitude estimation.

In an effort to combine the accuracy of an ESKF with the robustness of the SVSF, the ESKF and SVSF algorithms have been merged to create the ESKF-SVSF algorithm. In particular, a comprehensive fault detection strategy has been proposed to combine the optimality of the ESKF and the robustness of the SVSF. The proposed ESKF-SVSF algorithm was validated on experimental data collected from a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the presence of faulty gyroscope signals. In the experiment, four faulty test cases were consideblack, involving the injection of two types of faults into the raw gyroscope signals to simulate modeling uncertainty. Although the proposed ESKF-SVSF algorithm incurs a slightly increased computational load, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm yields more accurate attitude estimates than the conventional approach does in the presence of modeling uncertainty.","citedby-count":"28","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60068719","afid":"60068719","affilname":"Korea Aerospace Research Institute","affiliation-city":"Daejeon","affiliation-country":"South Korea"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015881","afid":"60015881","affilname":"University of Guelph","affiliation-city":"Guelph","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56664290800","authid":"56664290800","orcid":"0000-0001-6954-9059","authname":"Youn W.","surname":"Youn","given-name":"Wonkeun","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60068719"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015881"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24331431800","authid":"24331431800","authname":"Andrew Gadsden S.","surname":"Andrew Gadsden","given-name":"Stephen","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60068719"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015881"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude estimation | error state Kalman filter | inertial measurement units | modeling uncertainty | quaternion | smooth variable structure filter","article-number":"8865091","source-id":"21100374601","fund-acr":"NSERC","fund-no":"FR19116","fund-sponsor":"Research and Development","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077712881"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077712881?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077712881&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077712881&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077712881","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85077712881","eid":"2-s2.0-85077712881","dc:title":"Quaternion Filtering Based on Quaternion Involutions and its Application in Signal Processing","dc:creator":"Wang G.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Access","prism:eIssn":"21693536","prism:volume":"7","prism:pageRange":"149068-149079","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","prism:doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2944666","dc:description":"The quaternion gradient plays an important role in quaternion signal processing, and has undergone several modifications.

Our results show that it has good performance in rain removal and snow removal.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018011","afid":"60018011","affilname":"Donskoj Gosudarstvennyj Tehniceskij Universitet","affiliation-city":"Rostov-on-Don","affiliation-country":"Russian Federation"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014196","afid":"60014196","affilname":"Moscow State Technological University Stankin","affiliation-city":"Moscow","affiliation-country":"Russian Federation"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55802371401","authid":"55802371401","authname":"Voronin V.","surname":"Voronin","given-name":"V.","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018011"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56572834900","authid":"56572834900","authname":"Semenishchev E.","surname":"Semenishchev","given-name":"E.","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018011"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219971735","authid":"57219971735","authname":"Zhdanova M.","surname":"Zhdanova","given-name":"M.","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014196"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56157757100","authid":"56157757100","authname":"Sizyakin R.","surname":"Sizyakin","given-name":"R.","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018011"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204649388","authid":"57204649388","authname":"Zelenskii A.","surname":"Zelenskii","given-name":"A.","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014196"}]}],"authkeywords":"Anisotropic gradient | Inpainting | Quaternion framework | Rain and snow removal","article-number":"111690S","source-id":"40067","fund-acr":"Minobrnauka","fund-no":"218","fund-sponsor":"Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85076698019"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85076698019?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85076698019&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85076698019&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85076698019","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85076698019","eid":"2-s2.0-85076698019","dc:title":"14th International conference on Pattern Recognition and Information Processing, PRIP 2019","prism:publicationName":"Communications in Computer and Information Science","prism:issn":"18650929","prism:eIssn":"18650937","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783030354299"}],"prism:volume":"1055 CCIS","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 25 papers.

Since the previous methods treat detection of JPEG compressed color images as binary classification and JPEG compression with the same quantization matrix leaves slight tracks, three-class classification forensics of JPEG compressed color images with the same quantization matrix is a new and challenging problem. In this paper, two aspects are considered to solve this problem. First, if images are compressed, rounding and truncation error will occur. Thus, preprocessing of images is performed to extract error to highlight statistical difference which can help to classify. Second, the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is originally designed for the binary classification problem, so dealing with a three-class problem, it is necessary to reconstruct a suitable three-class classifier. Besides, convolutional neural network (CNN) parallelly deal with three channels of the color image. The relationship of the three channels is terminated. However, quaternion convolutional neural network (QCNN) which utilizes quaternion algebra not only is directly used to three-class classification but also retain the relationship between three channels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves good performance and is better than the state-of-the-art approaches investigated.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60273040","afid":"60273040","affilname":"Institute of Information Engineering","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143","afid":"60064143","affilname":"Nanjing University of Information Science &amp; Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025578","afid":"60025578","affilname":"Xidian University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/125082057","afid":"125082057","affilname":"State Key Laboratory of Mathematical Engineering and Advanced Computing","affiliation-city":"Zhengzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57218554050","authid":"57218554050","authname":"Wang H.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Hao","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219116697","authid":"57219116697","authname":"Wang J.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Jinwei","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"125082057"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60273040"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35771838800","authid":"35771838800","authname":"Zhai J.","surname":"Zhai","given-name":"Jiangtao","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8976166200","authid":"8976166200","authname":"Luo X.","surname":"Luo","given-name":"Xiangyang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"125082057"}]}],"authkeywords":"Quaternion convolutional neural network | Rounding and truncation error | Same quantization matrix | The color image | Three-class classification","article-number":"2934160","source-id":"21100374601","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"2018JR0018","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85074812875"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85074812875?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85074812875&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85074812875&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85074812875","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85074812875","eid":"2-s2.0-85074812875","dc:title":"Quaternionic toric manifolds","dc:creator":"Gentili G.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Symplectic Geometry","prism:issn":"15275256","prism:eIssn":"15402347","prism:volume":"17","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"267-300","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","prism:doi":"10.4310/JSG.2019.v17.n1.a7","dc:description":"In the present paper we introduce and study a new notion of toric manifold in the quaternionic setting.

Recently, it has been shown that different input representations, based on multidimensional algebras, such as complex and quaternion numbers, are able to bring to neural networks a more natural, compressive and powerful representation of the input signal by outperforming common real-valued NNs. Indeed, quaternion-valued neural networks (QNNs) better learn both internal dependencies, such as the relation between the Mel-filter-bank value of a specific time frame and its time derivatives, and global dependencies, describing the relations that exist between time frames. Nonetheless, QNNs are limited to quaternion-valued input signals, and it is difficult to benefit from this powerful representation with real-valued input data. This paper proposes to tackle this weakness by introducing a real-to-quaternion encoder that allows QNNs to process any one dimensional input features, such as traditional Mel-filter-banks for automatic speech recognition.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031214","afid":"60031214","affilname":"Université d'Avignon et des Pays du Vaucluse","affiliation-city":"Avignon","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002494","afid":"60002494","affilname":"Université McGill","affiliation-city":"Montreal","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/115923149","afid":"115923149","affilname":"Orkis","affiliation-city":"Aix-en-Provence","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193704479","authid":"57193704479","authname":"Parcollet T.","surname":"Parcollet","given-name":"Titouan","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031214"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"115923149"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55697911300","authid":"55697911300","authname":"Morchid M.","surname":"Morchid","given-name":"Mohamed","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031214"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603063660","authid":"6603063660","authname":"Linarès G.","surname":"Linarès","given-name":"Georges","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031214"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35547954100","authid":"35547954100","authname":"De Mori R.","surname":"De Mori","given-name":"Renato","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002494"}]}],"authkeywords":"Quaternion neural networks | Recurrent neural networks | Speech recognition","source-id":"21100212301","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073922196"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073922196?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073922196&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073922196&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073922196","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85073922196","eid":"2-s2.0-85073922196","dc:title":"Construction of generalized rotations and quasi-orthogonal matrices","dc:creator":"Verde-Star L.","prism:publicationName":"Special Matrices","prism:eIssn":"23007451","prism:volume":"7","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"107-113","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 January 2019","prism:doi":"10.1515/spma-2019-0010","dc:description":"We propose some methods for the construction of large quasi-orthogonal matrices and generalized rotations that may be used in applications in data communications and image processing.

CMF is performed by copying and pasting a part of an image into other portions of it. Despite several efforts to detect CMF, accurate identification of noise, blur and rotated region-mediated forged image areas is still difficult. A novel algorithm is developed on the basis of quaternion polar complex exponential transform (QPCET) to detect CMF and is conducted involving a few steps. Firstly, the suspicious image is divided into overlapping blocks. Secondly, invariant features for each block are extracted using QPCET. Thirdly, the duplicated image blocks are determined using k-dimensional tree (kd-tree) block matching. Lastly, a new technique is introduced to reduce the flat region-mediated false matches. Experiments are performed on numerous images selected from the CoMoFoD database. MATLAB 2017b is used to employ the proposed method. Metrics such as correct and false detection ratios are utilised to evaluate the performance of the proposed CMF detection method. Experimental results demonstrate the precise and efficient CMF detection capacity of the proposed approach even under image distortion including rotation, scaling, additive noise, blurring, brightness, colour reduction and JPEG compression. Furthermore, our method can solve the false match problem and outperform existing ones in terms of precision and false positive rate. The proposed approach may serve as a basis for accurate digital image forensic investigations.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60078085","afid":"60078085","affilname":"Universiti Malaysia Terengganu","affiliation-city":"Terengganu,","affiliation-country":"Malaysia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071164","afid":"60071164","affilname":"Mustansiriyah University","affiliation-city":"Baghdad","affiliation-country":"Iraq"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57220080366","authid":"57220080366","authname":"Thajeel S.A.","surname":"Thajeel","given-name":"Salam A.","initials":"S.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60071164"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193959864","authid":"57193959864","authname":"Mahmood A.S.","surname":"Mahmood","given-name":"Ali Shakir","initials":"A.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60071164"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211386545","authid":"57211386545","authname":"Humood W.R.","surname":"Humood","given-name":"Waleed Rasheed","initials":"W.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60071164"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6505595829","authid":"6505595829","authname":"Sulong G.","surname":"Sulong","given-name":"Ghazali","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60078085"}]}],"authkeywords":"Copy move forgery detection (CMFD) | Digital image forensic | Duplicated region detection | Feature extraction | QPCET","source-id":"17700155805","fund-acr":"ASU","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"A'Sharqiyah University","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073358391"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073358391?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073358391&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073358391&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073358391","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85073358391","eid":"2-s2.0-85073358391","dc:title":"Evaluation of the flight attitude with a low-cost gyro imu in a redundant configuration","dc:creator":"Grigorie T.L.","prism:publicationName":"International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM","prism:issn":"13142704","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9786197408768"}],"prism:volume":"19","prism:issueIdentifier":"2.2","prism:pageRange":"117-126","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","prism:doi":"10.5593/sgem2019/2.2/S09.015","dc:description":"The paper presents a way to increase the performance of inertial systems used to determine the aerospace vehicles' attitude based on low-cost MEMS gyro sensors. A vital role in the design process of the inertial navigation system is played by sensors distribution inside the inertial detection unit. This distribution can be different from case to case depending on the type of sensors or the signal processing algorithm used. The novelty of the proposed system consists in the using on each axis of the navigator inertial detection unit of linear redundant networks of miniaturized sensors whose data are statistically fused. This solution allows a high level of performance at a low cost and also the redundancy of the system by using a high number of sensors on each axis. The architecture chosen for this paper is one that has three sensors on each axis, and the method used for the fusion of the signals coming from the sensors is MRC – Maximal Ratio Combining. In order to determine the attitude angles (roll, pitch, yaw), the fused signals processing is done with a dedicated quaternionic method. The evaluation of the proposed architecture performance is accomplished through software implementation of the mathematical model using the Matlab-Simulink software package, followed by numerical simulations, which highlight the differences compared to the classical (non-redundant) architecture. For the simulations, two testing scenarios were conducted. One in which the gyros were low-cost MEMS, with poor performance, and one in which the gyros were high performance laser sensors, with a high-cost per unit.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60044461","afid":"60044461","affilname":"Academia Tehnica Militara","affiliation-city":"Bucharest","affiliation-country":"Romania"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023654","afid":"60023654","affilname":"Universitatea Transilvania din Brașov","affiliation-city":"Brasov","affiliation-country":"Romania"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114090599","afid":"114090599","affilname":"In Flight Research and Test Center Craiova","affiliation-city":null,"affiliation-country":"Romania"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14019389000","authid":"14019389000","authname":"Grigorie T.L.","surname":"Grigorie","given-name":"Teodor Lucian","initials":"T.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60044461"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211297650","authid":"57211297650","authname":"Tiganiuc D.","surname":"Tiganiuc","given-name":"Daniel","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"114090599"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56946939900","authid":"56946939900","authname":"Gresita C.","surname":"Gresita","given-name":"Constantin","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023654"}]}],"authkeywords":"Data fusion | Flight attitude evaluation | Inertial measurement unit | Quaternionic method | Redundant configuration","source-id":"21100274701","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85072961748"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85072961748?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85072961748&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85072961748&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85072961748","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85072961748","eid":"2-s2.0-85072961748","dc:title":"5th International Conference of Pioneer Computer Scientists, Engineers and Educators, ICPCSEE 2019","prism:publicationName":"Communications in Computer and Information Science","prism:issn":"18650929","prism:eIssn":"18650937","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789811501203"}],"prism:volume":"1059","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 104 papers.

Twelve different gesture realizations were prepared for each of 41 signs. Ten images have been rendered for each realization through interpolations between the starting and end poses. Experimental results demonstrate that owing to sufficient amount of training data a high recognition rate can be attained on images from a single RGB camera.

Image enhancement is the image processing of improving the quality that the results are more suitable for display or further image analysis. In this paper, we present a Hamiltonian quaternion framework-based model for color image enhancement. The basic idea is to apply α-rooting image enhancement approach for different image blocks. For this purpose, we split image in moving windows on disjoint blocks. The resulting image is a weighted mean of all processing blocks. The weights for every local and global enhanced image driven through optimization using a measure of enhancement (EME) as a cost function.

Namely, the quaternion alpha-rooting method to enhance the so generated \"quaternion\" image. Currently, there are only very limited techniques to convert a grayscale image to color image, and in this article we propose a novel conversion technique which helps in easily converting a grayscale image to a color or quaternion image. In addition to that, we describe the quaternion alpha-rooting method of quaternion image enhancement. Quaternion approach of enhancement allows for processing the multi-signaled image as a single unit. The fast algorithm of quaternion discrete Fourier transforms makes the implementation of the enhancement method practically possible and effective. The results of image enhancement by the proposed method and comparison with the traditional alpha-rooting of grayscale images are described. The metric used to assess the quality of enhancement shows good values for the results of the proposed enhancement. One of the enhancement metrics is the contrast-based metric referred to as the enhancement measure estimation (EME). Other metrics used to assess the quality of the enhanced images are signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), mean-square-root error (MSRE).","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007033","afid":"60007033","affilname":"City University of New York","affiliation-city":"New York","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003212","afid":"60003212","affilname":"The University of Texas at San Antonio","affiliation-city":"San Antonio","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006123399","authid":"7006123399","authname":"Grigoryan A.","surname":"Grigoryan","given-name":"Artyom M.","initials":"A.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003212"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194467413","authid":"57194467413","authname":"John A.","surname":"John","given-name":"Aparna","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003212"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003395533","authid":"7003395533","authname":"Agaian S.","surname":"Agaian","given-name":"Sos S.","initials":"S.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007033"}]}],"authkeywords":"Alpha-Rooting | Enhancement | Fourier Transforms. | Grayscale | Quaternion","article-number":"109930T","source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85072562908"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85072562908?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85072562908&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85072562908&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85072562908","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85072562908","eid":"2-s2.0-85072562908","dc:title":"Spectrally-shaped correlation with application to image registration","dc:creator":"Delmarco S.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","prism:issn":"0277786X","prism:eIssn":"1996756X","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781510626515"}],"prism:volume":"10993","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","prism:doi":"10.1117/12.2518171","dc:description":"Image correlation has proven useful for image filtering, matching, pattern recognition, and image registration over many decades. The two classical correlation forms, amplitude and phase correlation, display different properties. Amplitude correlation often provides a low, broad peak in the correlation domain. The broadness of the peak provides robustness to matching imagery exhibiting non-translational geometric offsets, such as rotation or scale differences. By contrast, phase correlation tends to provide a high, narrow peak. The high peak signifies high matching confidence while the narrow peak width provides accurate shift localization. However, the phase correlation peak degrades rapidly when matching against images with non-translational geometric offset. To provide tradeoffs between properties of these traditional correlation forms, in this paper we present a general, flexible form of correlation called Spectrally-Shaped Correlation (SSC). SSC provides control over the Fourier domain normalization of the correlation components. We apply SSC to the problem of image registration. We show how SSC contains the classical amplitude, phase, and phase-only correlation forms as special cases. First, we present the general theory of Fourier transforms for multi-channel imagery, modeled as hypercomplex-valued imagery. We present mathematical details of the transform techniques and develop the SSC approach. We then present numerical results demonstrating registration of real image data, acquired from a UAV operating in an urban environment, to reference imagery. We demonstrate a performance improvement of the SSC over the classical forms of correlation.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017016","afid":"60017016","affilname":"BAE Systems Inc.","affiliation-city":"Arlington","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8835566600","authid":"8835566600","authname":"Delmarco S.","surname":"Delmarco","given-name":"Stephen","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017016"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14527821000","authid":"14527821000","authname":"Webb H.","surname":"Webb","given-name":"Helen","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017016"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603822255","authid":"6603822255","authname":"Tom V.","surname":"Tom","given-name":"Victor","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017016"}]}],"authkeywords":"correlation | hypercomplex | image registration | quaternions","article-number":"1099306","source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
