Compared among the result of attitude data of original complementary filtering,the result of attitude data calculated by complementary filtering quaternion,which was adjusted by EKF,and the result of attitude data of euler angles adjusted by EKF,which was calculated by complementary filtering. Compared the three calculated results with the theoretical value,concluded that,the result had a certain amount of overshoot,a comparatively large fluctuation and large noise was existed when applied complementary filtering separately. The noise of the result reduced when applied EKF to the quaternion in complementary filtering process,overshoot was still existed. Applied EKF to adjust euler angles calculated by complementary filter could solve the problem of overshoot and reduce noise error,and the random fluctuation suppressed,got a better measurement result.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023380","afid":"60023380","affilname":"Chongqing University","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206789171","authid":"57206789171","authname":"Wang J.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Jian","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023380"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023380"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205206120","authid":"57205206120","authname":"Ma J.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Jianlin","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023380"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023380"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude algorithm | Complementary filter | Euler angle | Extended kalman filter EKF | Inertial measurement | Signal processing","source-id":"144788","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85046744466"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85046744466?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85046744466&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85046744466&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0167404818304243"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85046744466","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85046744466","eid":"2-s2.0-85046744466","dc:title":"A multi-channel approach through fusion of audio for detecting video inter-frame forgery","dc:creator":"Huang T.","prism:publicationName":"Computers and Security","prism:issn":"01674048","prism:volume":"77","prism:pageRange":"412-426","prism:coverDate":"2018-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"August 2018","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.cose.2018.04.013","pii":"S0167404818304243","dc:description":"The forgery operation of digital video in the temporal domain is often accompanied by the synchronization of the audio channel operation.

This paper first defines quaternion DFRNT (QDFRNT) which generalizes DFRNT to efficiently process quaternion signals, and then applies QDFRNT to color image adaptive watermarking. For the QDFRNT, this paper also derives the relationship between QDFRNT of a quaternion signal and DFRNT of four components for this signal to efficiently compute QDFRNT. For the color image adaptive watermarking based on QDFRNT and SVM, in order to efficiently utilize the color information in the adaptive process, this paper also exploits the human vision system’s (HVS) masking properties of texture, edge and color tone directly from the color host image to adaptively adjust the watermark strength for each block. In addition, the constraints in watermark embedding are discussed to preserve the watermarking energy. Experimental results show that: (a) the proposed efficient computation method takes only half the computational time of the direct method; (b) the comparison of five color models (RGB, YUV, YIQ, CIEL*a*b* and YCbCr) shows that the proposed QDFRNT-based watermarking scheme using YCbCr color model has the overall best performance and can achieve a good balance between invisibility and robustness to the Checkmark attacks; (c) The proposed scheme is superior to the existing schemes respectively using DCT, DFRNT, discrete quaternion Fourier transform (DQFT), discrete fractional quaternion Fourier transform (DFrQFT), and quaternion radial moments (QRMs). Moreover, the fractional order and the random matrix of QDFRNT enhance the security of the proposed scheme.","citedby-count":"36","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143","afid":"60064143","affilname":"Nanjing University of Information Science &amp; Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007511","afid":"60007511","affilname":"Sungkyunkwan University","affiliation-city":"Seoul","affiliation-country":"South Korea"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36805188500","authid":"36805188500","orcid":"0000-0002-2506-0427","authname":"Chen B.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Beijing","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007511"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191990905","authid":"57191990905","authname":"Zhou C.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Chunfei","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15136434400","authid":"15136434400","authname":"Jeon B.","surname":"Jeon","given-name":"Byeungwoo","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007511"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55576235500","authid":"55576235500","authname":"Zheng Y.","surname":"Zheng","given-name":"Yuhui","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219116697","authid":"57219116697","authname":"Wang J.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Jinwei","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive watermarking | Color image | Fractional random transform | Quaternion","source-id":"25627","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61572257","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85035144462"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85035144462?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85035144462&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85035144462&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85035144462","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85035144462","eid":"2-s2.0-85035144462","dc:title":"Robust perceptual color image hashing using randomized hypercomplex matrix factorizations","dc:creator":"Ghouti L.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","prism:issn":"13807501","prism:eIssn":"15737721","prism:volume":"77","prism:issueIdentifier":"15","prism:pageRange":"19895-19929","prism:coverDate":"2018-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 August 2018","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11042-017-5355-9","dc:description":"Compact representations of color image and video content allow efficient search, retrieval and storage of this content over the Internet and online repositories. However, most of these representations neither take into account the inherent correlation nor the perceptual redundancy of the color information. In this paper, we propose a perceptual hash representation for color images using robust image features. These features, most dominant singular vectors extracted using the quaternion singular value decomposition (QSVD) of pseudorandomly selected overlapping image blocks, are efficiently used for color image search and retrieval applications. Their robustness is guaranteed by the underlying singular vectors. The motivation behind our work is twofold: 1) the ability of the QSVD algorithm to provide the best low-rank approximation of color images in the Frobenius norm sense and 2) compact representations to handle the color components as a single entity. The QSVD algorithm leads to proper modeling of possible geometric attacks as an independent and identically-distributed (i.i.d) quaternionic random noise on the singular vectors. Such modeling simplifies the hash code detector design. Hash code robustness against geometric attacks is evaluated over a large set of test color images where the proposed scheme outperforms existing factorization-based hashing algorithms in terms of lower miss and false alarm probabilities by orders of magnitude. Finally, the improved robustness and performance does not come at the expense of increased computational complexity which is another salient feature of the proposed hashing scheme.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009506","afid":"60009506","affilname":"King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals","affiliation-city":"Dhahran","affiliation-country":"Saudi Arabia"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12796039800","authid":"12796039800","orcid":"0000-0002-6381-4250","authname":"Ghouti L.","surname":"Ghouti","given-name":"Lahouari","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009506"}]}],"authkeywords":"Fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform (FJLT) | Hash code detection | Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) | Quaternion SVD (QSVD) | Robust color perceptual hashing | Singular value decomposition (SVD)","source-id":"25627","fund-acr":"KFUPM","fund-no":"2015-048","fund-sponsor":"King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85034746612"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85034746612?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85034746612&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85034746612&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85034746612","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85034746612","eid":"2-s2.0-85034746612","dc:title":"A canonical form-based approach to affine registration of DTI","dc:creator":"Liu W.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","prism:issn":"13807501","prism:eIssn":"15737721","prism:volume":"77","prism:issueIdentifier":"15","prism:pageRange":"19697-19718","prism:coverDate":"2018-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 August 2018","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11042-017-5416-0","dc:description":"Due to the orientation feature of diffusion tensor images (DTI), tensors need to be reoriented during an affine registration. There exists two active reorientation schemes: finite strain (FS) and preserving principal direction (PPD). However, FS scheme limits its application on rigid deformation and PPD scheme suffers from computation load caused by the iteration. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we propose a canonical form-based affine registration of DTI, named as CFARD. We transform voxel sets into canonical forms where an affine registration is simplified as a rigid registration, while still preserves the effects of non-rigid components. This transforming thus extends the application of FS scheme to affine deformation. Furthermore, to reduce computation load, the quaternion technique is skillfully employed to seek a closed-form solution of the optimal rotation where no iteration is required. Extensive experiments are conducted on synthetic and real DTI data from the human brain. In contrast to four existing algorithms, the proposed CFARD improves the consistency between tensor orientation and the anatomical structures after deformation, and performs a better balance between accuracy and computational complexity.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005465","afid":"60005465","affilname":"University of Electronic Science and Technology of China","affiliation-city":"Chengdu","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/119801423","afid":"119801423","affilname":"Dongguan Data Science Software Technology Co., Ltd","affiliation-city":null,"affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/116081672","afid":"116081672","affilname":"Government Affairs Service Center of Health Department of Guangdong Province","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113261705","afid":"113261705","affilname":"Chengdu Vocational and Technical College of Industry","affiliation-city":"Chengdu","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57835018700","authid":"57835018700","authname":"Liu W.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113261705"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"119801423"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14055650900","authid":"14055650900","authname":"Chen L.T.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Lei Ting","initials":"L.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"116081672"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24829117000","authid":"24829117000","authname":"Cai H.B.","surname":"Cai","given-name":"Hong Bin","initials":"H.B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56127737000","authid":"56127737000","authname":"Liu Q.H.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Qi He","initials":"Q.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56358088800","authid":"56358088800","authname":"He J.","surname":"He","given-name":"Jin","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189994512","authid":"57189994512","authname":"Fei N.","surname":"Fei","given-name":"Nanxi","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"119801423"}]}],"authkeywords":"Affine registration | Canonical form | Diffusion tensor imaging | Quaternions | Reorientation","source-id":"25627","fund-no":"2015AA016010","fund-sponsor":"Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85030725811"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85030725811?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85030725811&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85030725811&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85030725811","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85030725811","eid":"2-s2.0-85030725811","dc:title":"Whole-Body Kinematic Control of Nonholonomic Mobile Manipulators Using Linear Programming","dc:creator":"Quiroz-Omaña J.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications","prism:issn":"09210296","prism:eIssn":"15730409","prism:volume":"91","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"263-278","prism:coverDate":"2018-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 August 2018","prism:doi":"10.1007/s10846-017-0713-4","dc:description":"This paper presents some improvements to the robot kinematic control strategy based on linear programming, as well as its application to a nonholonomic mobile manipulator.

We first propose a new positive definite function of the error variation to avoid joint movements when the robot end-effector stabilizes at a point different from the desired one. In addition, the nonholonomic constraint of the mobile base is imposed as an equality constraint, and inequality constraints are defined to avoid both violation of joint limits and collisions between the mobile base and obstacles in the plane. Last, a performance comparison between the linear programming strategy and an approach based on the pseudoinverse of the whole-body Jacobian matrix is presented. Experimental results show that the controller based on linear programming has low computational cost, and the robot is able to control its end-effector without colliding with obstacles in the plane and without violating its joints limits.

However, the sampling theory of quaternion-valued signals has not been well developed. In this paper, we present the generalized sampling expansions associated with QFT by using the generalized translation and convolution. We show that a σ-bandlimited quaternion-valued signal in QFT sense can be reconstructed from the samples of output signals of M linear systems based on QFT. Quaternion linear canonical transform is a generalization of QFT with six parameters.

It should therefore be of great interest to find the quaternionic signal whose time-frequency energy distribution is most concentrated in a given time-frequency domain. The present paper finds a new kind of quaternionic signals whose energy concentration is maximal in both time and frequency under the quaternionic Fourier transform. The new signals are a generalization of the classical prolate spheroidal wave functions to a quaternionic space, which are called the quaternionic prolate spheroidal wave functions. The purpose of this paper is to present the definition and fundamental properties of the quaternionic prolate spheroidal wave functions and to show that they can reach the extreme case within the energy concentration problem both from the theoretical and experimental description. The superiority of the proposed results can be widely applied to the application of 4D valued problems. In particular, these functions are shown as an effective method for bandlimited quaternionic signals relying on the extrapolation problem.

More input signals and post-processing may increase sensitivity but they also increase computation time and detection latency. This study aims to determine the simplest, fastest and most accurate HMM-based pre-impact fall detection algorithm. 5 IMUs placed at the torso, thighs and shanks are used for data collection. Multiple combinations of acceleration, gyroscope, orientation and quaternion are used as inputs to HMM, without any feature extraction or complex post-processing. Results show that the algorithm is capable of fall detection at about 200 ms after fall initiation with 90% sensitivity and 92% precision. The best performing IMU placements are at the torso and thigh. In addition, the computational latency of this algorithm can be as fast as 0.45 ms.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031307","afid":"60031307","affilname":"School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering","affiliation-city":"Singapore City","affiliation-country":"Singapore"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56444168300","authid":"56444168300","authname":"Er J.K.","surname":"Er","given-name":"Jie Kai","initials":"J.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031307"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16240990400","authid":"16240990400","authname":"Ang W.T.","surname":"Ang","given-name":"Wei Tech","initials":"W.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031307"}]}],"authkeywords":"Fall | Gaussian Mixture Model | Hidden Markov Model | Recovery","article-number":"8691981","source-id":"21100923628","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85056314430"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85056314430?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85056314430&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85056314430&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85056314430","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85056314430","eid":"2-s2.0-85056314430","dc:title":"Improved Color Image Encryption Algorithm Based on Quaternion Rotation","dc:creator":"Hu M.","prism:publicationName":"Yingyong Kexue Xuebao/Journal of Applied Sciences","prism:issn":"02558297","prism:volume":"36","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"601-610","prism:coverDate":"2018-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2018","prism:doi":"10.3969/j.issn.0255-8297.2018.04.004","dc:description":"Image encryption plays one of the important roles in the field of information security.

Original image is firstly decomposed into two of the same size of sub images, and then converted into pure quaternion representation of matrix. By using the property named quaternion rotation transformation, we can obtain a large amount of secret keys from iterations of the given initial secret key.

Firstly, the watermark information was encryption based on gravity model, and Multivariate Fourier transformation was used to process the maximum central region of cover image for obtaining the phase and amplitude information.

An impulse noise detection technique that is based on mean shift filtering and an effective vector filtering method that is based on channel suppression processing are proposed. The proposed denoising method excellently suppresses impulse noise in color images and performs well in both low and medium noise contamination cases. First, the noise detection method is performed to divide image pixels into noisy and possibly noise-free ones. Then, for the noisy pixels detected, according to the contamination levels, different denoising strategies are employed. For slightly corrupted images, the proposed channel-suppressed vector filter is performed, whereas for medially and highly contaminated images, a total variation denoising technique is applied, followed by a further impulse noise detection and channel-suppressed filtering. Finally, for the possible noise-free pixels, fine noise detection and channelsuppressed filtering are performed. Extensive simulation results exhibit the validity of the proposed solution by showing clear performance improvements over other widely used color image filtering methods.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025761","afid":"60025761","affilname":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15922652500","authid":"15922652500","authname":"Jin L.","surname":"Jin","given-name":"Lianghai","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57213268188","authid":"57213268188","authname":"Zhu Z.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Zhiliang","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23767272300","authid":"23767272300","authname":"Song E.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Enmin","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15060448300","authid":"15060448300","authname":"Ma G.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Guangzhi","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]}],"authkeywords":"color image | impulse noise | quaternion | vector filter","article-number":"043011","source-id":"25978","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050025242"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050025242?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85050025242&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85050025242&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050025242","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85050025242","eid":"2-s2.0-85050025242","dc:title":"Distributed estimation for spatial rigid motion based on dual quaternions","dc:creator":"Zu Y.","prism:publicationName":"Optimal Control Applications and Methods","prism:issn":"01432087","prism:eIssn":"10991514","prism:volume":"39","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"1371-1392","prism:coverDate":"2018-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July/August 2018","prism:doi":"10.1002/oca.2416","dc:description":"This paper proposes 2 distributed optimization algorithms for the estimation of spatial rigid motion using multiple image sensors in a connected network.

It detects horizontal, vertical, left- and right-diagonal edges with a single LQS convolution mask. The proposed filter is a canonic minimal filter of four LQS filters, each with different angles of rotation combined parallel wise. Different angles of rotation are a key features of the new filter such that horizontal, vertical, left, and right-diagonal LQS filter masks rotate pixels through angles π/2, 5π/2, 3π/2, and 7π/2, respectively. Although, the four LQS masks are combined parallel to make a single LQS mask but derived using four quaternion convolutions, one for each direction of edges, the LQS filter produces a result without the combination of results from four separate edge detectors. This methodology could be generalised to design more elaborate LQS filters to perform other geometric operations on colour image pixels. The proposed filter translates smoothly changing colours to different shades of grey and produces coloured edges in multiple directions, where there is a sudden change of colour in the original image. Another key idea of the proposed filter is that it is linear because it operates in homogeneous coordinates.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001359","afid":"60001359","affilname":"University of Essex","affiliation-city":"Colchester","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191874642","authid":"57191874642","authname":"Yasmin S.","surname":"Yasmin","given-name":"Shagufta","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001359"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003346836","authid":"7003346836","authname":"Sangwine S.J.","surname":"Sangwine","given-name":"Stephen J.","initials":"S.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001359"}]}],"source-id":"5400152646","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047544925"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047544925?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85047544925&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85047544925&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0166864118303547"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047544925","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85047544925","eid":"2-s2.0-85047544925","dc:title":"Corrigendum to ‘Homotopy pullback of A<inf>n</inf>-spaces and its applications to A<inf>n</inf>-types of gauge groups’ [Topology Appl. 187 (2015) 1–25] (S0166864115000838) (10.1016/j.topol.2015.02.014))","dc:creator":"Tsutaya M.","prism:publicationName":"Topology and its Applications","prism:issn":"01668641","prism:volume":"243","prism:pageRange":"159-162","prism:coverDate":"2018-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 July 2018","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.topol.2018.04.012","pii":"S0166864118303547","dc:description":"Introduction: The author regret that Section 9 of [5] contains a mistake, where we studied the classification problem of the gauge groups of principal [Formula presented]-bundles over [Formula presented].

The following is a weaker version of Theorem 1.2 in [5], to which we only add the condition [Formula presented]. We denote the largest integer less than or equal to t by [Formula presented]. Theorem 1.1 For a positive integer [Formula presented], the gauge groups [Formula presented] and [Formula presented] are [Formula presented]-equivalent if [Formula presented] and [Formula presented] for any odd prime p. Moreover, if [Formula presented], the converse is also true. Proof To show the if part, it is sufficient to show that the wedge sum [Formula presented] extends over the product [Formula presented]. The case when [Formula presented] has already been verified in [4, Section 5]. Suppose [Formula presented]. By Toda's result [3, Section 7], we have homotopy groups of [Formula presented] as follows: [Formula presented] for [Formula presented], where [Formula presented] if [Formula presented]. This implies that, if [Formula presented] and [Formula presented], there is no obstruction to extending a map [Formula presented] over [Formula presented]. It also implies that, for [Formula presented] and a map [Formula presented], the composite [Formula presented] extends over [Formula presented]. Then we obtain the if part by induction and Theorem 1.1 in [5]. The proof of the converse in [5] correctly works for [Formula presented]. □ Remark 1.2 For [Formula presented] and [Formula presented], Toda's result [3, Theorem 7.5] says [Formula presented] This is the first non-trivial homotopy group where the obstruction is not detected in our method. Suppose there exists an extension [Formula presented] of [Formula presented], where [Formula presented] and i is the inclusion [Formula presented]. In the rest of this article, we compute the e-invariant [1] of the obstruction to extending the map f over [Formula presented]. This obstruction is regarded as an element [Formula presented]. The map h factors as the composite of the suspension map [Formula presented] and the inclusion [Formula presented], where [Formula presented] is the homotopy class corresponding to h under the isomorphism [Formula presented]. Consider the following maps among cofiber sequences: [Formula presented] As in [4], take the appropriate generator [Formula presented] such that [Formula presented] Actually, one can take the generator a as the image of [Formula presented] under the complexification map [Formula presented] from the quaternionic K-theory, where γ denotes the canonical line bundle and [Formula presented] the 1-dimensional trivial quaternionic vector bundle. We denote the restriction of a on [Formula presented] by [Formula presented]. Note that we can obtain the following by the Künneth theorem for K-theory: [Formula presented] Lemma 1.3 Let [Formula presented]. Then the following holds. (1) Suppose i is even. Then [Formula presented] is an image of the complexification map from the quaternionic K-theory.(2) Suppose i is odd. Then [Formula presented] is an image of the complexification map from the quaternionic K-theory, but [Formula presented] is not. Proof Consider the following commutative diagram induced by the cofiber sequence: [Formula presented] Note that all the groups appearing in this diagram are free abelian. This implies the vertical maps are injective. As is well-known, the index of the image of the map [Formula presented] is 1 if i is even, and is 2 if i is odd. Now the lemma follows from the above diagram and the fact that the image of [Formula presented] is generated by [Formula presented]. □ Since [Formula presented], there is a lift [Formula presented] of [Formula presented] contained in the image of the complexification from [Formula presented]. Denote the image of [Formula presented] under the map [Formula presented] by [Formula presented]. We take [Formula presented], [Formula presented] and [Formula presented]. We fix a generator of [Formula presented] such that its image in [Formula presented] is [Formula presented] We denote its images by [Formula presented] and [Formula presented]. As in [1, Section 7], the e-invariant λ of the map [Formula presented] is characterized by [Formula presented] in [Formula presented], where λ is well-defined as a residue class in [Formula presented] if n is odd, and in [Formula presented] if n is even. If the map [Formula presented] is null-homotopic, then λ is 0 as the corresponding residue class. By the result of [4], we have [Formula presented] where [Formula presented] and [Formula presented] are inductively defined by the equations [Formula presented] Since a is in the image of the complexification from [Formula presented], we have [Formula presented] for even [Formula presented] and [Formula presented] for odd [Formula presented] by Lemma 1.3. Combining with [4, Propositions 4.2 and 4.4], we have the following proposition. Lemma 1.4 The following hold. (1) For [Formula presented], [Formula presented].(2) For an odd prime p, [Formula presented]. There exists [Formula presented] such that the following holds: [Formula presented] Again by Lemma 1.3, [Formula presented] if n is odd. Note that the Chern characters ch a and [Formula presented] are computed as [Formula presented] Then, by computing [Formula presented] by two ways as in [4, Section 2], we obtain [Formula presented] By the definition of [Formula presented], we get [Formula presented] Then we have the following proposition from the e-invariant λ and Lemma 1.4. [Formula presented] Proposition 1.5 If f extends over [Formula presented], then the following hold. (1) For [Formula presented], [Formula presented].(2) For an odd prime p, [Formula presented]. Actually, nothing is improved by this proposition for odd p. But, for [Formula presented], we obtain the new result since the torsion part of [Formula presented] is annihilated by 4 [2, Corollary (1.22)]. Theorem 1.6 The adjoint bundle [Formula presented] is trivial as a fiberwise [Formula presented]-space if and only if k is divisible by [Formula presented]. From this result, one may expect that we can derive the classification of 2-local [Formula presented]-types of the gauge groups. But, to distinguish between [Formula presented] and [Formula presented] as [Formula presented]-spaces, we need some new technique. So, we leave this problem for now.

Saliency detection in the frequency domain possesses great advantages compared with that in the spatial domain due to its computational efficiency and succinct model design. Many excellent frequency domain based models, such as SR, phase spectrum of quaternion Fourier transform, hypercomplex Fourier transform (HFT), have made great progress in predicting human eye fixations. However, there still exists a vital drawback among them-ignoring the different contributions of image channels to saliency detection. In our observation, chrominance component of an image may play an unequally important role as luminance component in different situations. In this letter, we propose a frequency domain based framework, which exploits HFT-based saliency algorithm and finds a way to weigh the importance of different channels in saliency detection across space. In the first step, saliency maps corresponding to different channels are generated independently. In the second step, a combination of both saliency maps is performed using an adaptive entropy-based uncertainty weighting approach. We provide an extensive evaluation and show that our proposed method outperforms nine outstanding eye fixation prediction models on four most commonly-used datasets.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014966","afid":"60014966","affilname":"Peking University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201912546","authid":"57201912546","orcid":"0000-0003-0814-3121","authname":"Huang K.","surname":"Huang","given-name":"Kan","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014966"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195397698","authid":"57195397698","orcid":"0000-0002-6525-6686","authname":"Zhu C.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Chunbiao","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014966"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55901136600","authid":"55901136600","orcid":"0000-0003-0140-0949","authname":"Li G.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Ge","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014966"}]}],"authkeywords":"Eye fixation model | frequency domain | saliency detection","source-id":"17316","fund-no":"U1611461","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
