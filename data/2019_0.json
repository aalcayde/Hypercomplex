In this study, two scientific payloads of the satellite were used: the Enhanced Resolution Camera (ERC) with a field of view (FoV) of 89.8 × 67.5 km and a resolution of 54.6 m; and the High Precision Telescope (HPT) with a FoV of 3.1 × 2.3 km and a resolution of 4.7 m. Errors in pointing especially on a payload with a small field of view like the HPT could mean the satellite missing its target. The target pointing of Diwata-2 is assessed by firstly, computing the differences in the coordinates of the planned target, the center of the actual image taken by the satellite and the projected target from the satellite's attitude logs. As such, a quaternion-based transformation system is created to simulate the satellite's local vertical local horizontal system from a given Earth-centered inertial system. Secondly, the differences were then tabulated, and its averages were computed to derived pointing corrections. Applying the algorithm to the satellite's images shows that there is an average error in pitch and roll of 0.590° and 0.004°, 6.436° and 6.503°,-5.8465° and-6.499° between the set target to the actual image acquired, between the actual image and from attitude logs and between the set target and from the attitude logs, respectively.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071491","afid":"60071491","affilname":"University of the Philippines Diliman","affiliation-city":"Quezon City","affiliation-country":"Philippines"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206665797","authid":"57206665797","authname":"Monay K.","surname":"Monay","given-name":"K.","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60071491"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206657078","authid":"57206657078","authname":"Olivar F.R.","surname":"Olivar","given-name":"F.

In the coarse change detection stage, we construct the difference image (DI) by the use of the wavelet frequency difference (WFD) method, and obtain the DI saliency map by the use of quaternion Fourier transform (QFT). At the same time, the noise in the non-salient regions is suppressed. Finally, the coarse change detection map obtained by selecting a threshold for the DI saliency map is pre-classified (changed pixels, unchanged pixels, undetermined pixels) by the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm. In the fine change detection phase, the neighbourhood features of the changed pixels and the unchanged pixels in the coarse change map are extracted and used as reliable samples for extreme learning machine (ELM) training. The trained ELM classifier is then used to perform change detection on the coarse change detection map, to obtain the final change detection map. Experiments on two real SAR datasets show that the proposed method can not only obtain reliable training samples, but it can also result in a significant improvement in change detection performance.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60084619","afid":"60084619","affilname":"University of Science and Technology Liaoning","affiliation-city":"Anshan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60069731","afid":"60069731","affilname":"Information Engineering University China","affiliation-city":"Zhengzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/110256713","afid":"110256713","affilname":"Surveying and Mapping Engineering Institute","affiliation-city":"Shenyang","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209296348","authid":"57209296348","authname":"Wang C.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Chang","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069731"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60084619"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56414442400","authid":"56414442400","authname":"Zhang Y.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Yongsheng","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069731"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209298645","authid":"57209298645","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xu","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"110256713"}]}],"source-id":"19700201680","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"41671409","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85091937708"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85091937708?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85091937708&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85091937708&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85091937708","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85091937708","eid":"2-s2.0-85091937708","dc:title":"Direction Finding of Wideband Signals Using Identically Oriented Vector Antennas","dc:creator":"Liu N.","prism:publicationName":"ICSIDP 2019 - IEEE International Conference on Signal, Information and Data Processing 2019","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781728123455"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2019-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2019","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICSIDP47821.2019.9173351","dc:description":"A polarimetric quaternion data alignment based involution stacking approach is proposed to wideband direction finding with identically oriented vector antennas.

The approach relies on two key features: (i) the algebraic representation of polarization information, namely Stokes parameters, thanks to quaternions and (ii) the exploitation of physical constraints linked to polarization generalizing non-negativity constraints. QNMF improves NMF model identifiability by revealing the key disambiguating role played by polarization information.

Moreover, the proposed algorithm is robust to some attacks, such as additive white Gaussian noise, JPEG compression, rotation, and scaling.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143","afid":"60064143","affilname":"Nanjing University of Information Science &amp; Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005244","afid":"60005244","affilname":"Southeast University","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36805188500","authid":"36805188500","authname":"Chen B.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Beijing","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211984723","authid":"57211984723","authname":"Gao Y.","surname":"Gao","given-name":"Ye","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55286480600","authid":"55286480600","authname":"Yu M.","surname":"Yu","given-name":"Ming","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57215069417","authid":"57215069417","authname":"Wu P.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Peng","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7203086899","authid":"7203086899","authname":"Shu H.","surname":"Shu","given-name":"Huazhong","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]}],"authkeywords":"Copy-move forgery detection | Fractional Zernike moments | PatchMatch algorithm | Quaternion","source-id":"24883","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61572258","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077733791"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077733791?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077733791&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077733791&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077733791","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85077733791","eid":"2-s2.0-85077733791","dc:title":"The Quaternion Stochastic Information Gradient Algorithm for Nonlinear Adaptive Systems","dc:creator":"Ogunfunmi T.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","prism:issn":"1053587X","prism:eIssn":"19410476","prism:volume":"67","prism:issueIdentifier":"23","prism:pageRange":"5909-5921","prism:coverDate":"2019-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 December 2019","prism:doi":"10.1109/TSP.2019.2944757","dc:description":"In this paper, we develop a kernel adaptive filter for quaternion data, using stochastic information gradient (SIG) cost function based on the information theoretic learning (ITL) approach. The new algorithm (QKSIG) is useful for quaternion-based kernel applications of nonlinear filtering. Adaptive filtering in quaterion domain intrinsically incorporates component-wise real valued cross-correlation or the coupling within the dimensions of the quaternion input. We apply generalized Hamilton-real (GHR) calculus that is applicable to quaternion Hilbert space for evaluating the cost function gradient. The QKSIG algorithm minimizes Shannon's entropy of the error between the filter output and desired response and minimizes the divergence between the joint densities of input-desired and input-output pairs. The SIG technique reduces the computational complexity of the error entropy estimation. Here, ITL with SIG approach is applied to quaternion adaptive filtering for three different reasons. First, it reduces the algorithm computational complexity compared to our previous work quaternion kernel minimum error entropy algorithm (QKMEE). Second, it improves the filtering performance by considering the coupling within the dimensions of the quaternion input. Third, it performs better in biased or non-Gaussian signal and noise environments due to ITL approach. We present convergence analysis and steady-state performance analysis results of the new algorithm (QKSIG). Simulation results are used to show the behavior of the new algorithm QKSIG in quaternion non-Gaussian signal and noise environments compared to the existing ones such as quadruple real-valued kernel stochastic information gradient (KSIG) and quaternion kernel LMS (QKLMS) algorithms.","citedby-count":"13","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010451","afid":"60010451","affilname":"Santa Clara University","affiliation-city":"Santa Clara","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004919562","authid":"7004919562","orcid":"0000-0003-3517-9779","authname":"Ogunfunmi T.","surname":"Ogunfunmi","given-name":"Tokunbo","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010451"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14061092900","authid":"14061092900","authname":"Safarian C.","surname":"Safarian","given-name":"Carlo","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010451"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive filters | kernel least mean square (LMS) algorithm | non-Gaussian signal | quaternions | Shannon's entropy | stochastic information gradient","article-number":"8853311","source-id":"17391","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85076458613"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85076458613?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85076458613&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85076458613&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85076458613","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85076458613","eid":"2-s2.0-85076458613","dc:title":"The Wigner-Ville Distribution Associated with the Quaternion Offset Linear Canonical Transform","dc:creator":"El Kassimi M.","prism:publicationName":"Analysis Mathematica","prism:issn":"01333852","prism:eIssn":"1588273X","prism:volume":"45","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"787-802","prism:coverDate":"2019-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 December 2019","prism:doi":"10.1007/s10476-019-0007-0","dc:description":"The Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) and the quaternion offset linear canonical transform (QOLCT) are useful tools in signal analysis and image processing.

Therefore, it is of practical significance to improve the quality of infrared images. To make full use of the information on adjacent points, preserve the image structure, and avoid staircase artifacts, this paper proposes a super-resolution reconstruction method for infrared images based on quaternion total variation and high-order overlapping group sparse. The method uses a quaternion total variation method to utilize the correlation between adjacent points to improve image anti-noise ability and reconstruction effect. It uses the sparsity of a higher-order gradient to reconstruct a clear image structure and restore smooth changes. In addition, we performed regularization by using the denoising method, alternating direction method of multipliers, and fast Fourier transform theory to improve the efficiency and robustness of our method. Our experimental results show that this method has excellent performance in objective evaluation and subjective visual effects.","citedby-count":"13","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60121802","afid":"60121802","affilname":"Chongqing College of Electronic Engineering","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60092440","afid":"60092440","affilname":"Minnan Normal University","affiliation-city":"Zhangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005465","afid":"60005465","affilname":"University of Electronic Science and Technology of China","affiliation-city":"Chengdu","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"31771234","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195413144","authid":"57195413144","authname":"Liu X.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Xingguo","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60121802"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55558023400","authid":"55558023400","authname":"Chen Y.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Yingpin","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60092440"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23985664500","authid":"23985664500","authname":"Peng Z.","surname":"Peng","given-name":"Zhenming","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56184861600","authid":"56184861600","authname":"Wu J.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Juan","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60121802"}]}],"authkeywords":"High-order gradient | Infrared image | Overlapping group sparse | Regularization by denoising | Super-resolution","article-number":"5139","source-id":"130124","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"FBJG20180015","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071418578"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071418578?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85071418578&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85071418578&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071418578","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85071418578","eid":"2-s2.0-85071418578","dc:title":"Images encryption algorithm based on the quaternion multiplication and the XOR operation","dc:creator":"Boussif M.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","prism:issn":"13807501","prism:eIssn":"15737721","prism:volume":"78","prism:issueIdentifier":"24","prism:pageRange":"35493-35510","prism:coverDate":"2019-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 December 2019","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11042-019-08108-9","dc:description":"In this paper, we propose an images encryption algorithm based on the quaternion multiplication and the XOR function.

The proportional action depends on a nonlinear transformation of the sliding variable, while the integral action of fractional order rejects nondifferentiable disturbances, such as turbulent effects and gust winds, enforcing a sliding motion in finite time. The exponential convergence of a quaternion-based error is guaranteed for well-posed attitude tracking, and the regularity of the control signal can be adjusted with respect to the fractional order. Notably, the proposal includes, as particular cases, first-order and second-order sliding mode control schemes. Experiments illustrate the viability of the proposal, and a comparative study versus PD, PI-like, first-order sliding mode and second-order sliding mode supertwisting controllers is presented and discussed.","citedby-count":"25","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022916","afid":"60022916","affilname":"Universidad Autónoma de Chihuahua","affiliation-city":"Chihuahua","affiliation-country":"Mexico"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017848","afid":"60017848","affilname":"Université de Technologie de Compiègne","affiliation-city":"Compiegne","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007966","afid":"60007966","affilname":"Tecnológico de Monterrey","affiliation-city":"Monterrey","affiliation-country":"Mexico"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/109429724","afid":"109429724","affilname":"Research Center for Advanced Studies","affiliation-city":"Saltillo","affiliation-country":"Mexico"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55489536900","authid":"55489536900","authname":"Oliva-Palomo F.","surname":"Oliva-Palomo","given-name":"Fátima","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"109429724"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204699024","authid":"57204699024","orcid":"0000-0001-5125-2644","authname":"Muñoz-Vázquez A.J.","surname":"Muñoz-Vázquez","given-name":"Aldo Jonathan","initials":"A.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022916"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23569744300","authid":"23569744300","orcid":"0000-0002-6553-1641","authname":"Sánchez-Orta A.","surname":"Sánchez-Orta","given-name":"Anand","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"109429724"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603789248","authid":"6603789248","orcid":"0000-0002-1813-0394","authname":"Parra-Vega V.","surname":"Parra-Vega","given-name":"Vicente","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"109429724"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55490116500","authid":"55490116500","authname":"Izaguirre-Espinosa C.","surname":"Izaguirre-Espinosa","given-name":"Carlos","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007966"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/47461061100","authid":"47461061100","orcid":"0000-0001-8324-8762","authname":"Castillo P.","surname":"Castillo","given-name":"Pedro","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017848"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude control | fractional order control | nonlinear PI controller | quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) | sliding mode control","article-number":"8616814","source-id":"17336","fund-acr":"CONACYT","fund-no":"133344","fund-sponsor":"Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071463684"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071463684?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85071463684&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85071463684&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0925400519311013"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071463684","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85071463684","eid":"2-s2.0-85071463684","dc:title":"Quaternion-based parallel feature extraction: Extending the horizon of quantitative analysis using TLC-SERS sensing","dc:creator":"Zhao Y.","prism:publicationName":"Sensors and Actuators, B: Chemical","prism:issn":"09254005","prism:volume":"299","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2019-11-15","prism:coverDisplayDate":"15 November 2019","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.snb.2019.126902","pii":"S0925400519311013","dc:description":"Quantitative analysis using thin-layer chromatography coupled in tandem with surface-enhanced Raman scattering (TLC-SERS) still remains a grand challenge due to many uncontrollable variations during the TLC developing process and the random nature of the SERS substrates. Traditional chemometric methods solve this problem by sampling multiple SERS spectra in the sensing spot and then conducting statistical analysis of the SERS signals to mitigate the variation of quantitative analysis, while still ignoring the spatial distribution of the target species and the correlation among the multiple sampling points. In this paper, we proposed for the first time a parallel feature extraction and fusion method based on quaternion signal processing techniques, which can enable quantitative analysis using recently established TLC-SERS techniques. By marking three deterministic sampling points, we recorded spatially correlated SERS spectra to constitute an integral representation model of triple-spectra by a pure quaternion matrix. Quaternion principal component analysis (QPCA) was utilized for features extraction and followed by feature crossing among the quaternion principal components to obtain final fusion spectral feature vectors. Support vector regression (SVR) was then used to establish the quantitative model of melamine-contaminated milk samples with seven concentrations (1 ppm–250 ppm). Compared with traditional TLC-SERS analysis methods, QPCA method significantly improved the accuracy of quantification by reaching only 7% and 2% quantization errors at 20 and 105 ppm concentration. Validation testing based on reasonable amount of statistic measurement results showed consistently smaller measurement errors and variance, which proved the effectiveness of QPCA method for TLC-SERS based quantitative sensing applications.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018465","afid":"60018465","affilname":"Yanshan University","affiliation-city":"Qinhuangdao","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013402","afid":"60013402","affilname":"Oregon State University","affiliation-city":"Corvallis","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55726071000","authid":"55726071000","authname":"Zhao Y.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Yong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013402"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8979575900","authid":"8979575900","authname":"Tan A.","surname":"Tan","given-name":"Ailing","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013402"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189617955","authid":"57189617955","authname":"Squire K.","surname":"Squire","given-name":"Kenny","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013402"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55876694000","authid":"55876694000","authname":"Sivashanmugan K.","surname":"Sivashanmugan","given-name":"Kundan","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013402"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35099830400","authid":"35099830400","authname":"Wang A.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Alan X.","initials":"A.X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013402"}]}],"authkeywords":"Quantitative analysis | Quaternion principal component analysis | Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy | Thin layer chromatography","article-number":"126902","source-id":"25236","fund-acr":"NSF","fund-no":"2017- 67021-26606","fund-sponsor":"National Science Foundation","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85075902851"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85075902851?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85075902851&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85075902851&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85075902851","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85075902851","eid":"2-s2.0-85075902851","dc:title":"An improved saliency detection method based on hypercomplex Fourier transform","dc:creator":"Pan Y.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Physics: Conference Series","prism:issn":"17426588","prism:eIssn":"17426596","prism:volume":"1314","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2019-11-06","prism:coverDisplayDate":"6 November 2019","prism:doi":"10.1088/1742-6596/1314/1/012094","dc:description":"Saliency detection is a challenging direction in the field of computer vision.

However, large-scale calibration targets are very difficult to fabricate. Based on the idea of error tracing, a high-precision calibration method for vision system with large field of view by constructing a virtual 3-D calibration target with a laser tracker was proposed in this article. A virtual 3-D calibration target that covers the whole measurement space can be established flexibly and the measurement precision of the vision system can be traceable to the laser tracker. First, virtual 3-D targets by calculating rigid body transformation with unit quaternion method were constructed. Then, the high-order distortion camera model was taken into consideration. Besides, the calibration parameters were solved with Levenberg–Marquardt optimization algorithm. In the experiment, a binocular stereo vision system with the field of view of 4 × 3 × 2 m3 was built for verifying the validity and precision of the proposed calibration method. It is measured that the accuracy with the proposed method can be greatly improved comparing with traditional plane calibration method. The method can be widely used in industrial applications, such as in the field of calibrating large-scale vision-based coordinate metrology, and six-degrees of freedom pose tracking system for dimensional measurement of workpiece, as well as robotics geometrical accuracy detection and compensation.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023813","afid":"60023813","affilname":"Shanghai University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56040397900","authid":"56040397900","authname":"Zhang X.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xi","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57212407942","authid":"57212407942","orcid":"0000-0002-5038-2380","authname":"Xu Y.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Yuanzhi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57208900345","authid":"57208900345","authname":"Li H.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Haichao","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57212409886","authid":"57212409886","authname":"Zhu L.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Lijing","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211221129","authid":"57211221129","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56795977800","authid":"56795977800","authname":"Li W.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]}],"authkeywords":"calibration | error tracing | Large-scale vision metrology system | laser tracker | virtual 3-D target","source-id":"144749","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"2016YFC0302402","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073599077"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073599077?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073599077&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073599077&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073599077","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85073599077","eid":"2-s2.0-85073599077","dc:title":"Uncertainty Principles for The Quaternion Linear Canonical Transform","dc:creator":"Achak A.","prism:publicationName":"Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras","prism:issn":"01887009","prism:eIssn":"16614909","prism:volume":"29","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2019-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 November 2019","prism:doi":"10.1007/s00006-019-1020-x","dc:description":"The (right-sided) Quaternion Linear Canonical transform (QLCT) satisfies some uncertainty principles in a similar way to the Euclidean Fourier transform.

First, the dimension-reduced MUSIC (DR-MUSIC) algorithm is proposed for DOA and range estimation with low computational complexity, and given a closed-form expression of polarization estimation. Next, based on the quaternion theory, a novel algorithm named quaternion non-circular MUSIC (QNC-MUSIC) is proposed for parameter estimation of non-circular signals with high estimation accuracy.

The algorithm first considers the three CT images as three imaginary parts of an array of pure quaternion and calculates their QPHFM and then constructs feature image using the amplitude of QPHFM, and finally makes the chaotic scrambling to the feature image and then the XOR operation to the feature image and watermark image to generate key image. Experiment results prove the proposed scheme can resist common image processing attacks and geometric attacks effectively and thus can be well applied to the copyright protection of three

appealing efficiency and performance recently. However, conventional greedy algorithms utilize the ℓ2 norm based loss function and suffer from severe performance degradation in the presence of gross corruption and outliers. Furthermore, they cannot be directly applied to the recovery of quaternion sparse signals due to the noncommutativity of quaternion multiplication. To alleviate these problems, we propose a robust greedy algorithm referred as Cauchy matching pursuit (CauchyMP) for SSR and extend it for quaternion SSR. By leveraging the Cauchy estimator and generalizing it to the quaternion space to measure the residual error, our method can robustly recover the sparse signal in both real and quaternion space from noisy data corrupted by various severe noises and outliers. To tackle the resulting quaternion optimization problem, we develop an efficient half-quadratic optimization algorithm by introducing two quaternion operators. In addition, we have also devised a CauchyMP based classifier termed CauchyMPC for robust multiclass classification. The experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate the efficacy and robustness of the proposed methods for SSR, block SSR, quaternion SSR and multiclass classification.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60102085","afid":"60102085","affilname":"Chengdu University","affiliation-city":"Chengdu","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029386","afid":"60029386","affilname":"Hubei University","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023380","afid":"60023380","affilname":"Chongqing University","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55568493500","authid":"55568493500","orcid":"0000-0002-1033-9281","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yulong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102085"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188872929","authid":"57188872929","orcid":"0000-0002-2283-9048","authname":"Zou C.","surname":"Zou","given-name":"Cuiming","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102085"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404591899","authid":"7404591899","authname":"Tang Y.Y.","surname":"Tang","given-name":"Yuan Yan","initials":"Y.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55541053600","authid":"55541053600","authname":"Li L.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Luoqing","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029386"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9250649000","authid":"9250649000","authname":"Shang Z.","surname":"Shang","given-name":"Zhaowei","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023380"}]}],"authkeywords":"Greedy algorithm | Multiclass classification | Robust signal recovery","source-id":"25548","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"11771130","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067436140"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067436140?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85067436140&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85067436140&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0165168419302191"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067436140","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85067436140","eid":"2-s2.0-85067436140","dc:title":"The octonionic Fourier transform: Uncertainty relations and convolution","dc:creator":"Lian P.","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing","prism:issn":"01651684","prism:volume":"164","prism:pageRange":"295-300","prism:coverDate":"2019-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2019","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.sigpro.2019.06.015","pii":"S0165168419302191","dc:description":"The uncertainty principle is a fundamental principle in mathematics and physics, and also plays an important role in signal processing.

To establish the observer, some important properties of dual vectors and dual quaternions are presented and proved, additionally, the kinematics of dual-transformation matrices is deduced, and the transition relationship between dual quaternions and dual transformation matrices is subsequently analyzed. An important feature of the observer is that all estimation states are ensured to be C∞ continuous, and estimation errors are shown to exhibit asymptotic convergence if the signals to be estimated are bounded. Furthermore, to achieve tracking control objectives, the proposed observer is combined with an independently designed proportional-derivative-like feedback control law (using full-state feedback), and a special Lyapunov 'strictification' process is employed to ensure a separation property between the observer and the controller, which further guarantees almost global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop tracking error dynamics. Numerical simulation results for a prototypical spacecraft pose tracking mission application are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.","citedby-count":"17","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013789","afid":"60013789","affilname":"Beihang University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013372","afid":"60013372","affilname":"The University of Texas at Austin","affiliation-city":"Austin","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007136","afid":"60007136","affilname":"Laboratoire des Signaux et Systèmes","affiliation-city":"Gif-sur-Yvette","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56515860800","authid":"56515860800","orcid":"0000-0003-4302-5323","authname":"Dong H.","surname":"Dong","given-name":"Hongyang","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013789"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8931326900","authid":"8931326900","orcid":"0000-0002-5563-310X","authname":"Hu Q.","surname":"Hu","given-name":"Qinglei","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013789"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55933946100","authid":"55933946100","authname":"Akella M.R.","surname":"Akella","given-name":"Maruthi R.","initials":"M.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013372"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56234307900","authid":"56234307900","orcid":"0000-0002-6630-3624","authname":"Mazenc F.","surname":"Mazenc","given-name":"Frederic","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007136"}]}],"authkeywords":"Dual quaternion | Lyapunov strictification | pose tracking control | six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) control | velocity observer","article-number":"8454269","source-id":"17342","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"2018M630057","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85082058578"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85082058578?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85082058578&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85082058578&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85082058578","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85082058578","eid":"2-s2.0-85082058578","dc:title":"Infrared dim and small target detection based on spatio-temporal spectral saliency","dc:creator":"Zhang K.","prism:publicationName":"Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications","prism:issn":"09226389","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781643680187"}],"prism:volume":"320","prism:pageRange":"1118-1123","prism:coverDate":"2019-10-02","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2 October 2019","prism:doi":"10.3233/FAIA190292","dc:description":"Infrared dim and small target detection plays a critical role in space-based infrared system and infrared search and track applications.

To get the more accurate salient target, we propose a visual saliency detection method based on the fusion of spatial and frequency domain analysis. Firstly, the image is smoothed by a Gaussian filter and then segmented by the superpixel segmentation of SLIC. The spatial saliency map is calculated by the color distance. Secondly, the saliency map of frequency domain is obtained by hypercomplex Fourier transform. Finally, the point multiplication operation is adopted to merge the spatial and the frequency domain saliency map. Compared with the others methods, the model we proposed can well retain the complete contour, highlight the target and suppress the background.1","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60088965","afid":"60088965","affilname":"Guangxi University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Liuzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216386451","authid":"57216386451","authname":"Pan Y.","surname":"Pan","given-name":"Yongcai","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60088965"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55358587500","authid":"55358587500","authname":"Zhang Y.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Yuwei","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60088965"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57217007946","authid":"57217007946","authname":"Wei Y.","surname":"Wei","given-name":"Yanxia","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60088965"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57212729948","authid":"57212729948","authname":"Liu Q.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Qingzheng","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60088965"}]}],"authkeywords":"Frequency domain | HFT | Saliency detection | SLIC","article-number":"9095064","source-id":"21100995088","fund-no":"IPICT-2016-07","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077375255"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077375255?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077375255&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077375255&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S240589631931002X"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077375255","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85077375255","eid":"2-s2.0-85077375255","dc:title":"A method for misalignment correction of star sensors","dc:creator":"Strietzel R.","prism:publicationName":"IFAC-PapersOnLine","prism:eIssn":"24058963","prism:volume":"52","prism:issueIdentifier":"12","prism:pageRange":"43-48","prism:coverDate":"2019-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"October 2019","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.ifacol.2019.11.067","pii":"S240589631931002X","dc:description":"Star sensor systems are used, to increase the accuracy of attitude measurement and to enhance the reliability of the measurement system. For obtaining the output signal of the sensor system a data fusion of the measurements of the system components is necessary. The arrangement of the sensors is influenced by the payload, antennas and other equipment. A misalignment of a sensor reduces the accuracy of the system. It can occur with mechanical tensions or temperature variations. If one sensor of the system is mounted very stable on the spacecraft platform, then it can be used to the correction of the misalignment of other sensors. The misalignment correction bases on the comparison of the measurements of the regarded sensors. The signals of the misaligned sensor can be corrected by rotation of the coordinate system. Simulation results of a two-sensor arrangement under real conditions are presented.","citedby-count":"0","prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602624768","authid":"6602624768","authname":"Strietzel R.","surname":"Strietzel","given-name":"Roland","initials":"R."}],"authkeywords":"Accuracy | Attitude transformation | Model reference adaptation | Quaternions","source-id":"21100456158","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"}]}}]}}
