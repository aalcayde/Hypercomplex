State-of-the art keypoint based matchers, such as SURF and SIFT, work very well on clean imagery. However, performance can degrade significantly in the presence of high noise and clutter levels. Noise and clutter cause the formation of false features which can degrade recognition performance. To address this problem, previously we developed an extension to the classical amplitude and phase correlation forms, which provides improved robustness and tolerance to image geometric misalignments and noise. This extension, called Alpha-Rooted Phase Correlation (ARPC), combines Fourier domain-based alpha-rooting enhancement with classical phase correlation. ARPC provides tunable parameters to control the alpha-rooting enhancement. These parameter values can be optimized to tradeoff between high narrow correlation peaks, and more robust wider, but smaller peaks. Previously, we applied ARPC in the radon transform domain for logo image recognition in the presence of rotational image misalignments. In this paper, we extend ARPC to incorporate quaternion Fourier transforms, thereby creating Alpha-Rooted Quaternion Phase Correlation (ARQPC). We apply ARQPC to the logo image recognition problem. We use ARQPC to perform multiple-reference logo template matching by representing multiple same-class reference templates as quaternion-valued images. We generate recognition performance results on publicly-available logo imagery, and compare recognition results to results generated from standard approaches. We show that small deviations in reference templates of sameclass logos can lead to improved recognition performance using the joint matching inherent in ARQPC.

One of the biggest challenges in micro-sensor motion estimation is the drift problem caused by integration of angular rates to obtain orientation. To reduce the drift, existing algorithms make use of gravity and earth magnetic filed measured by accelerometers and magnetometers respectively. Unfortunately, body segment acceleration and environment magnetic disturbance produce strong interferences to the gravity and earth magnetic field measurement respectively. This paper presents a novel sensor fusion algorithm for driftfree orientation estimation, where a quaternion-based complementary Kalman filter is designed. To optimize the performance under interference, this filter fuses gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer signals adaptively based on their information confidence, which are evaluated by computing their interference level. The proposed algorithm showed least error compared with the existing methods in the quantitative experiments, and its effectiveness was also verified by the stable and accurate human motion estimation.","citedby-count":"24","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027363","afid":"60027363","affilname":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017161","afid":"60017161","affilname":"National University of Singapore","affiliation-city":"Singapore City","affiliation-country":"Singapore"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/106426394","afid":"106426394","affilname":"China-Singapore Institute of Digital Media","affiliation-city":"Singapore City","affiliation-country":"Singapore"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35323189700","authid":"35323189700","authname":"Sun S.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Shuyan","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"106426394"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36010162500","authid":"36010162500","authname":"Meng X.","surname":"Meng","given-name":"Xiaoli","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35098923400","authid":"35098923400","authname":"Ji L.","surname":"Ji","given-name":"Lianying","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7409253494","authid":"7409253494","authname":"Wu J.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Jiankang","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403972528","authid":"7403972528","authname":"Wong W.","surname":"Wong","given-name":"Wai Choong","initials":"W.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017161"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive weighting | Drift | Human motion capture | Kalman filtering | Sensor fusion","article-number":"5711994","source-id":"19700190330","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79952236853"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79952236853?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=79952236853&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=79952236853&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79952236853","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:79952236853","eid":"2-s2.0-79952236853","dc:title":"Quaternion frequency watermarking algorithm for color images","dc:creator":"Sun J.","prism:publicationName":"2010 International Conference on Multimedia Technology, ICMT 2010","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781424478743"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2010-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2010","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICMULT.2010.5630418","dc:description":"A new method to embed the watermarks in the amplitude of the quaternion is proposed this paper.

In order to process color image directly, the quaternion mode is introduced, in which the Red, Green and Blue values of each pixel of a color image are represented as single pure quaternion valued pixel. And a color image can be represented as a pure quaternion image. Second, a computationally simple method for singular value decomposition (SVD) is adopted to perform principle component analysis (PCA) on the pure quaternion image. Finally, change detection in a pair of color satellite images can be achieved Experimental results show the superior of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods for change detection.

The measurement remnant chi-square method is used to automatically adjust the sliding window basing on the innovation sequence. The experiment result shows that this new approach could improve the accuracy of the integrated navigation system effectively when the measurement noise is unknown.

The transformation we propose is parameterized by a bivector and a quadratic form, the choice of which is related to the application to be treated. A general definition for 4D signal defined on the plane is also given; for particular choices of spinors, it coincides with the definitions of S. Sangwine and T. BÃ¼low.

A computationally efficient and robust algorithm for estimating orientation is critical. This paper gives a quaternion-based orientation tracking algorithm for human motion tracking with a triaxial angular rate sensor, a triaxial accelerometer, and a triaxial magnetometer. The algorithm utilizes the Gauss-Newton method for parameter optimization in conjunction with our adaptive filter. Based on the use of the Gauss-Newton method, particularly the reduced-order implementation, this paper presents a method to avoid computing matrix inverse compared to the conventional G-N method to decrease the computing time. In addition, considering the effects of ferromagnetic magnetic disturbances and body motions acceleration, the paper proposes an adaptive filter to accommodate the disturbance situation. Real-time implementation and testing results of the quaternion-based algorithm are presented. Experimental results validate the algorithm and show the robustness and efficiency for human motion tracking.

In this paper, a nonlinear saliency fusing approach, that considers human perceptual characteristics for automatic video retargeting, is being proposed. First, we incorporate features from phase spectrum of quaternion Fourier Transform (PQFT) in spatial domain and global motion residual based on matched feature points by the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) tracker in temporal domain. In addition, under a cropping-and-scaling retargeting framework, we propose content-aware information loss metrics and a hierarchical search to find optimal cropping window parameters. Results show the success of our approach on detecting saliency regions and retargeting on images and videos.

Usual color segmentation or edge detection operators perform a global processing on the image. Thus, every area into an image is detected. The whole image is subdivided into several region by labeled pixels, or boundaries in case of an edge detection. Our purpose is to extract only specific areas into an image sharing a specific color attribute, hence sharing a common color based on a specific hue. The quaternionic geometrical transformation into RGB color space is used. A specific hue axis is defined. From this axis, a criterion defines a color subspace into an RGB color space using the quaternionic HSI interpretation of RGB vectors.

The final goal is the integration of this motion-tracking device within a portable rehabilitation system for brain injury patients. A set of four inertial sensors mounted on a special garment worn by the patient provides the quaternions representing the patient upper limb's orientation in space. A kinematic model is built to estimate 3D upper limb motion for accurate therapeutic evaluation. The human upper limb is represented as a kinematic chain of rigid bodies with three joints and six degrees of freedom. Validation of the system has been performed by co-registration of movements with a commercial optoelectronic tracking system. Successful results are shown that exhibit a high correlation among signals provided by both devices and obtained at the Institut Guttmann Neurorehabilitation Hospital.

Therefore, an effective machine condition monitoring system plays an important role in these factories to ensure that their production and process are running smoothly all the time. In this paper, a new and effective machine condition monitoring system using log-polar mapper, quaternion based thermal image correlator and max-product fuzzy neural network classifier is proposed. Two classification characteristics, namely peak to sidelobe ratio (PSR) and real to complex ratio of the discrete quaternion correlation output (p-value) are applied in this proposed machine condition monitoring system. Large PSR and p-value showed a good match among correlation of the input thermal image with a particular reference image, but reversely for small PSR and p-value match. In the simulation, log-polar mapping is found to have solved the rotation and scaling invariant problems in quaternion based thermal image correlation. Besides, log-polar mapping can possess two fold data compression capability. Log-polar mapping helps smoothen up the output correlation plane, hence making better measurement for PSR and p-values. The simulation results have also proven that the proposed system is an efficient machine condition monitoring system with an accuracy of more than 94%.
