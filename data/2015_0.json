The low power consumption IMU with an inner Digital Motion Processor(DMP) from InvenSense Inc. called MPU9150, which contains triaxial accelerometers, triaxial gyroscopes, triaxial magnetometers and inner DMP. Firstly, we got attitude quaternion from DMP, and used the factored quaternion algorithm (FQA) to calculate course angle quaternion component. Then the Kalman Filtering algorithm was used to mix them together to acquire the accurate and good real-Time performance attitude .The experimental results showed that Kalman filtering algorithm to mix DMP output and magnetometers data have better performance than gradient descent algorithm and complementary filter algorithm even in static performance and dynamic performance and power consumption.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60102083","afid":"60102083","affilname":"Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology","affiliation-city":"Shenzhen","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073689","afid":"60073689","affilname":"Fiberhome Telecommunication Technologies Company Limited","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100367666","afid":"100367666","affilname":"System Engineering Institute","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55976622500","authid":"55976622500","authname":"Ning Y.","surname":"Ning","given-name":"Yunkun","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102083"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55535053800","authid":"55535053800","authname":"Ma Y.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Yingnan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"100367666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193064915","authid":"57193064915","authname":"Li L.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Liangju","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073689"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55991204300","authid":"55991204300","authname":"Gao X.","surname":"Gao","given-name":"Xing","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"100367666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193760335","authid":"57193760335","authname":"Zhao G.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Guoru","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"100367666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202992272","authid":"57202992272","authname":"Jin Z.","surname":"Jin","given-name":"Zongzhen","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"100367666"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude Estimate | Digital Motion Processor | Kalman Filter | MPU9150 | Quaternion-based","source-id":"21100840010","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"2012AA02A604","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherhybridgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Hybrid Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963984730"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963984730?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84963984730&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84963984730&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963984730","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84963984730","eid":"2-s2.0-84963984730","dc:title":"Quaternion common factor decomposition of head-related impulse response","dc:creator":"Wang Z.","prism:publicationName":"2015 23rd European Signal Processing Conference, EUSIPCO 2015","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780992862633"}],"prism:pageRange":"544-548","prism:coverDate":"2015-12-22","prism:coverDisplayDate":"22 December 2015","prism:doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2015.7362442","dc:description":"The hypercomplex number quaternion is an extension to the complex number and is widely used in computer graphic, image processing and multiple dimensional linear time-invariant systems.

A two dimensional quaternion common factor decomposition (QCFD) algorithm is developed to represent each quaternion impulse response as the convolution of two factor impulse responses. By using the proposed QCFD algorithm, quaternion impulse responses with the same elevation will share the same elevation factor while quaternion impulses with the same azimuth will share the same azimuth factor.

We can obtain image and video with better quality and more pleasing appearance by applying these correction methods. Besides, color corrected image and video also can be used to enhance performance of many post-processing techniques, such as pattern recognition, object tracking, human face matching, etc. In this paper, we have proposed a color correction algorithm based on quaternion algebra for color image and video. First, our method uses quaternion color distance metric to compute the pixel-based color differences between target image (or video frame) and reference image/video frame with similar appearance but slightly different illumination condition. After the color differences of image pixels are obtained, we use these pixels to calculate a correction matrix and use this matrix to correct target image and video frame. Our method can be applied to image and video with fast processing speed and has good performance when compared it with state-of-the-art method in the literature. The algorithm is also simple, effective, and easy to be implemented.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005429","afid":"60005429","affilname":"National Taiwan University","affiliation-city":"Taipei","affiliation-country":"Taiwan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202463605","authid":"7202463605","authname":"Pei S.","surname":"Pei","given-name":"Soo Chang","initials":"S.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005429"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35191694600","authid":"35191694600","authname":"Hsiao Y.","surname":"Hsiao","given-name":"Yu Zhe","initials":"Y.Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005429"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color calibration | color stabilization | image processing | quaternion algebra | white balancing","article-number":"7351337","source-id":"144684","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84956597945"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84956597945?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84956597945&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84956597945&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84956597945","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84956597945","eid":"2-s2.0-84956597945","dc:title":"A location-aware scale-space method for salient object detection","dc:creator":"Xiang D.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - International Conference on Image Processing, ICIP","prism:issn":"15224880","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781479983391"}],"prism:volume":"2015-December","prism:pageRange":"4195-4199","prism:coverDate":"2015-12-09","prism:coverDisplayDate":"9 December 2015","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351596","dc:description":"Many existing saliency detection methods made an assumption that the salient object is on the center of the image and incorporated such center-biased assumption in the design of their algorithms. Obviously, this is not always proper to set, especially for those imageries acquired by unmanned monitoring system or device (e.g., surveillance camera), in which the salient object could appear in any location within the image. Consequently, the resulted saliency detection performance could be greatly degraded. In this paper, an existing hypercomplex Fourier transform (HFT) based saliency detection algorithm is investigated and modified for improving the saliency detection performance. In details, we remove its prior assumption on 'center bias' and exploit a location-aware strategy to identify the optimal saliency map across multiple scales of the image. Extensive simulation results have justified that the proposed location-aware HFT-based approach clearly outperforms existing five state-of-the-art algorithms on saliency detection.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010432","afid":"60010432","affilname":"Soochow University","affiliation-city":"Suzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005510","afid":"60005510","affilname":"Nanyang Technological University","affiliation-city":"Singapore City","affiliation-country":"Singapore"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57089855500","authid":"57089855500","authname":"Xiang D.","surname":"Xiang","given-name":"Dan","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010432"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8366198400","authid":"8366198400","authname":"Zhong B.","surname":"Zhong","given-name":"Baojiang","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010432"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202837226","authid":"7202837226","authname":"Ma K.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Kai Kuang","initials":"K.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005510"}]}],"authkeywords":"center-biased | minimum entropy | Saliency detection | scale-space | unmanned monitoring system","article-number":"7351596","source-id":"144684","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959285787"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959285787?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84959285787&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84959285787&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959285787","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84959285787","eid":"2-s2.0-84959285787","dc:title":"Adaptive Kalman filtering and smoothing for gravitation tracking in mobile systems","dc:creator":"Sarkka S.","prism:publicationName":"2015 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation, IPIN 2015","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781467384025"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2015-12-03","prism:coverDisplayDate":"3 December 2015","prism:doi":"10.1109/IPIN.2015.7346762","dc:description":"This paper is concerned with inertial-sensor-based tracking of the gravitation direction in mobile devices such as smartphones. Although this tracking problem is a classical one, choosing a good state-space for this problem is not entirely trivial. Even though for many other orientation related tasks a quaternion-based representation tends to work well, for gravitation tracking their use is not always advisable. In this paper we present a convenient linear quaternion-free state-space model for gravitation tracking. We also discuss the efficient implementation of the Kalman filter and smoother for the model. Furthermore, we propose an adaption mechanism for the Kalman filter which is able to filter out shot-noises similarly as has been proposed in context of adaptive and robust Kalman filtering.

In this paper, we provide an intelligent detection method for untwisted strands in transmission lines using image sequences captured from the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Considering that transmission line detection is a challenging problem under illumination variations and cluttered background, we propose to extract transmission lines using quaternion phase congruency (QPC) model and cascade filters of shape filtering and color filtering. Compare with current methods based on gradient computation, we can extract the region of transmission lines with higher accuracy due to invariance to noises and contrast changes. To meet real-time requirement of untwisted stands fault detection, we establish statistical histogram of edge orientation around region of transmission line and the divergence of edge orientation is used as a metric to locate untwisted strands faults. In contrast to current methods, experimental results show that the proposed method can obtain an improvement of detection accuracy of 9.8% for the untwisted strands faults in transmission lines.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025084","afid":"60025084","affilname":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57117255700","authid":"57117255700","authname":"Chen Y.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Yong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55695017800","authid":"55695017800","authname":"Xu Y.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Yi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]}],"authkeywords":"Quaternion Phase Congruency | transmission line detection | untwisted strands fault","article-number":"7345033","source-id":"26058","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61201384","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84942196102"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84942196102?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84942196102&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84942196102&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84942196102","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84942196102","eid":"2-s2.0-84942196102","dc:title":"Stronger uncertainty principles for hypercomplex signals","dc:creator":"Yang Y.","prism:publicationName":"Complex Variables and Elliptic Equations","prism:issn":"17476933","prism:eIssn":"17476941","prism:volume":"60","prism:issueIdentifier":"12","prism:pageRange":"1696-1711","prism:coverDate":"2015-12-02","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2 December 2015","prism:doi":"10.1080/17476933.2015.1041938","dc:description":"In this paper, for real para-vector-valued signals, we obtain stronger uncertainty principles in terms of covariance and absolute covariance based on Fourier transform in both directional and the spatial cases.

The proposed algorithm leverages quaternion polar cosine transform to holistically capture the spatial and chromatic characteristics of digital image, and rotation-invariant features are derived from the phase information in the quaternion frequency domain. In addition, we also propose an information theoretic based metric for feature quality assessment and a greedy strategy to select the optimal subset of features for hash computation. Extensive experiments over a large database demonstrate that the proposed work shows higher content identification accuracy than most competing algorithms, and the resulting hash is compact and easy to compute.","citedby-count":"39","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019533","afid":"60019533","affilname":"Tianjin University","affiliation-city":"Tianjin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55145899000","authid":"55145899000","authname":"Li Y.N.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Yue Nan","initials":"Y.N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019533"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221237366","authid":"57221237366","authname":"Wang P.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Ping","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019533"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55797981700","authid":"55797981700","authname":"Su Y.T.","surname":"Su","given-name":"Yu Ting","initials":"Y.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019533"}]}],"authkeywords":"Content identification | perceptual hashing | quaternion | robust hashing | rotation invariance","article-number":"7293622","source-id":"17316","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"ZDSY20120613125016389","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959420436"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959420436?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84959420436&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84959420436&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959420436","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84959420436","eid":"2-s2.0-84959420436","dc:title":"Lattice Index Coding","dc:creator":"Natarajan L.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","prism:issn":"00189448","prism:volume":"61","prism:issueIdentifier":"12","prism:pageRange":"6505-6525","prism:coverDate":"2015-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2015","prism:doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2491924","dc:description":"The index coding problem involves a sender with K messages to be transmitted across a broadcast channel, and a set of receivers each of which demands a subset of the K messages while having a prior knowledge of a different subset as side information. We consider the specific case of noisy index coding where the broadcast channel is Gaussian and every receiver demands all the messages from the source. Instances of this communication problem arise in wireless relay networks, sensor networks, and retransmissions in broadcast channels. We construct lattice index codes for this channel by encoding the K messages individually using K modulo lattice constellations and transmitting their sum modulo a coarse lattice. We introduce a design metric called side information gain that measures the advantage of a code in utilizing the side information at the receivers, and hence, its goodness as an index code. Based on the Chinese remainder theorem, we then construct lattice index codes with large side information gains using lattices over the following principal ideal domains: 1) rational integers; 2) Gaussian integers; 3) Eisenstein integers; and 4) Hurwitz quaternions. Among all lattice index codes constructed using any densest lattice of a given dimension, our codes achieve the maximum side information gain. Finally, using an example, we illustrate how the proposed lattice index codes can benefit Gaussian broadcast channels with more general message demands.","citedby-count":"22","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019578","afid":"60019578","affilname":"Monash University","affiliation-city":"Melbourne","affiliation-country":"Australia"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36348698600","authid":"36348698600","authname":"Natarajan L.","surname":"Natarajan","given-name":"Lakshmi","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019578"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54899280300","authid":"54899280300","authname":"Hong Y.","surname":"Hong","given-name":"Yi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019578"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603926385","authid":"6603926385","authname":"Viterbo E.","surname":"Viterbo","given-name":"Emanuele","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019578"}]}],"authkeywords":"Chinese remainder theorem | Gaussian broadcast channel | index coding | lattice codes | principal ideal domain | side information","article-number":"7299671","source-id":"15107","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84956971231"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84956971231?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84956971231&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84956971231&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84956971231","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84956971231","eid":"2-s2.0-84956971231","dc:title":"Specular image highlight inpainting based on lattice Boltzmann model","dc:creator":"Zhu Y.","prism:publicationName":"Yi Qi Yi Biao Xue Bao/Chinese Journal of Scientific Instrument","prism:issn":"02543087","prism:volume":"36","prism:issueIdentifier":"12","prism:pageRange":"2747-2755","prism:coverDate":"2015-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 December 2015","dc:description":"During endoscopic examination procedure, due to the specular reflection of the mucus on the surface of organ internal chamber, highlights often appear in high definition images.

In the first step, the quaternion is used to express the color information of the high definition images. Then, the quaternion rotating operation is adopted to express the chromatism of two pixels. Furthermore, the chromatism is introduced into the relaxation factor design of lattice Boltzmann model. Finally, the diffusion of lattice Boltzmann model is used to repair the highlights.

Because quaternion is unable to represent the set of attitudes both globally and uniquely, it can result in unwinding. Unwinding makes a spacecraft perform an unnecessary large-angle maneuver when a small-angle maneuver in the opposite rotational direction is sufficient to achieve the objective. The first controller converges to the equilibrium without singularity in finite time, while the second one converges to the region near the equilibrium without singularity, chattering and unwinding in finite time. Saturation function is introduced to the first controller to eliminate singularity, while a novel fast terminal sliding mode control is introduced to the second controller to eliminate singularity and unwinding. Theoretical analysis shows that the controllers can make the spacecraft follow a time-varying reference attitude signal in finite time and guarantee the stability of the overall closed-loop system. Numerical simulations also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes.","citedby-count":"36","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55712507200","authid":"55712507200","authname":"Guo Y.","surname":"Guo","given-name":"Yong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403349877","authid":"7403349877","authname":"Song S.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Shen Min","initials":"S.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56564829600","authid":"56564829600","authname":"Li X.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Xue Hui","initials":"X.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude tracking control | finite-time stability | quaternion | terminal sliding mode control | unwinding","source-id":"25479","fund-no":"61174037","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84941414324"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84941414324?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84941414324&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84941414324&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0031320315002228"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84941414324","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84941414324","eid":"2-s2.0-84941414324","dc:title":"Quaternion generic Fourier descriptor for color object recognition","dc:creator":"Li H.","prism:publicationName":"Pattern Recognition","prism:issn":"00313203","prism:volume":"48","prism:issueIdentifier":"12","prism:pageRange":"3895-3903","prism:coverDate":"2015-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 December 2015","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.patcog.2015.06.002","pii":"S0031320315002228","dc:description":"By introducing quaternions, Fourier transforms, the fundamental tool in signal and image processing, were extended to treat a color image in a holistic manner. On the other hand, color image description has long been a major topic of pattern recognition. In this work, inspired by the quaternion Fourier transforms, we propose a quaternion generic Fourier descriptor to describe color images holistically and effectively without losing any color information. The theoretical framework to construct a set of invariants with respect to geometric transformation is also provided. Moreover, several experiments are conducted on color image databases to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed invariants. The results provide supports for that the quaternion generic Fourier descriptor invariants have striking robustness to geometric transformation and noise. Remarkable progress in accuracy, robustness and efficiency of color object recognition has been made by the proposed descriptor.

However, the use of OMCS can be difficult, which has prompted research on alternative sensing technologies, such as body-worn inertial sensors. Methods: We developed a drift-free method to estimate the three-dimensional (3D) displacement of a body part during cyclical motions using body-worn inertial sensors. We performed the Fourier analysis of the stride-by-stride estimates of the linear acceleration, which were obtained by transposing the specific forces measured by the tri-axial accelerometer into the global frame using a quaternion-based orientation estimation algorithm and detecting when each stride began using a gait-segmentation algorithm. The time integration was performed analytically using the Fourier series coefficients; the inverse Fourier series was then taken for reconstructing the displacement over each single stride. The displacement traces were concatenated and spline-interpolated to obtain the entire trace. Results: The method was applied to estimate the motion of the lower trunk of healthy subjects that walked on a treadmill and it was validated using OMCS reference 3D displacement data; different approaches were tested for transposing the measured specific force into the global frame, segmenting the gait and performing time integration (numerically and analytically). The width of the limits of agreements were computed between each tested method and the OMCS reference method for each anatomical direction: Medio-Lateral (ML), VerTical (VT) and Antero-Posterior (AP); using the proposed method, it was observed that the vertical component of displacement (VT) was within ±4mm (±1.96 standard deviation) of OMCS data and each component of horizontal displacement (ML and AP) was within ±9mm of OMCS data. Conclusions: Fourier harmonic analysis was applied to model stride-by-stride linear accelerations during walking and to perform their analytical integration. Our results showed that analytical integration based on Fourier series coefficients was a useful approach to accurately estimate 3D displacement from noisy acceleration data.","citedby-count":"21","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028039","afid":"60028039","affilname":"Sant'Anna Scuola Universitaria Superiore Pisa","affiliation-city":"Pisa","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"pubmed-id":"26597696","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005616188","authid":"7005616188","authname":"Sabatini A.","surname":"Sabatini","given-name":"Angelo Maria","initials":"A.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028039"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55948532200","authid":"55948532200","authname":"Ligorio G.","surname":"Ligorio","given-name":"Gabriele","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028039"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55971103000","authid":"55971103000","authname":"Mannini A.","surname":"Mannini","given-name":"Andrea","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028039"}]}],"authkeywords":"Fourier harmonic analysis | Gait analysis | Inertial measurement unit | Pose estimation","article-number":"106","source-id":"28586","fund-acr":"EC","fund-no":"CIP-ICT-PSP-2011-5-297225","fund-sponsor":"European Commission","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963836311"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963836311?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84963836311&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84963836311&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963836311","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84963836311","eid":"2-s2.0-84963836311","dc:title":"Output feedback, attitude dynamics, robustness","dc:creator":"Mazenc F.","prism:publicationName":"2015 European Control Conference, ECC 2015","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783952426937"}],"prism:pageRange":"1249-1254","prism:coverDate":"2015-11-16","prism:coverDisplayDate":"16 November 2015","prism:doi":"10.1109/ECC.2015.7330711","dc:description":"This paper considers stabilization of fully actuated rigid-body attitude dynamics in the absence of angular velocity measurements and presents new robustness results to bounded unknown external disturbance torques. In particular, it is assumed that only body orientation is measured in the form of a unit-quaternion signal. It is well known that the passivity properties of the dynamics allows design of velocity-free controllers using a first-order stable filter driven by measured states. When external disturbance torques are taken into account, however, the robustness properties of these passivity-based output feedback controllers cannot be readily analyzed because the Lyapunov-like function from which the controller is derived has a time-derivative that is only negative semidefinite, and therefore non-strict. This obstacle is circumvented through a new partial-strictification approach which ultimately allows the characterization of robustness properties for this closed-loop system.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013372","afid":"60013372","affilname":"The University of Texas at Austin","affiliation-city":"Austin","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007136","afid":"60007136","affilname":"Laboratoire des Signaux et Systèmes","affiliation-city":"Gif-sur-Yvette","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56234307900","authid":"56234307900","authname":"Mazenc F.","surname":"Mazenc","given-name":"Frederic","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007136"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56819448400","authid":"56819448400","authname":"Yang S.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Sungpil","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013372"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55933946100","authid":"55933946100","authname":"Akella M.","surname":"Akella","given-name":"Maruthi R.","initials":"M.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013372"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude Dynamics | Disturbance Torques | Output Feedback | Passivity | Robust Stabilization","article-number":"7330711","source-id":"21100455702","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84943327731"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84943327731?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84943327731&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84943327731&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0096300315012813"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84943327731","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84943327731","eid":"2-s2.0-84943327731","dc:title":"Connecting spatial and frequency domains for the quaternion Fourier transform","dc:creator":"De Bie H.","prism:publicationName":"Applied Mathematics and Computation","prism:issn":"00963003","prism:volume":"271","prism:pageRange":"581-593","prism:coverDate":"2015-11-15","prism:coverDisplayDate":"15 November 2015","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.amc.2015.09.045","pii":"S0096300315012813","dc:description":"The quaternion Fourier transform (qFT) is an important tool in multi-dimensional data analysis, in particular for the study of color images.

The recently defined 'Mustard' convolution behaves nicely in the frequency domain, but complicates the corresponding spatial domain analysis. The present paper analyses in detail the correspondence between classical convolution and the new Mustard convolution. In particular, an expression is derived that allows one to write classical convolution as a finite linear combination of suitable Mustard convolutions.

The sensors are fixed inside the femoral prosthesis trial and checkerboard patterns are printed on the internal surface of the acetabular prosthesis trial. An extended Kalman filter is designed to fuse the data from inertial sensors and the magnetometer orientation estimation. A novel image processing algorithm for depth estimation is developed. The algorithms have been evaluated under the simulation with rotation quaternion and translation vector and the experimental results shows that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the orientation estimation is less then 0.05 degree and the RMSE for depth estimation is 1mm. Finally, the femoral head is displayed in 3D graphics in real time to help surgeons with the component positioning.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025278","afid":"60025278","affilname":"Tsinghua University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"26736858","prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56437028800","authid":"56437028800","authname":"Gao J.","surname":"Gao","given-name":"Jiyang","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025278"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56369467000","authid":"56369467000","authname":"Su S.","surname":"Su","given-name":"Shaojie","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025278"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57050568400","authid":"57050568400","authname":"Chen H.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Hong","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025278"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55000510700","authid":"55000510700","authname":"Wang Z.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Zhihua","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025278"}]}],"authkeywords":"Extended Kalman filter | Image sensor | Inertial sensors | THR","article-number":"7318958","source-id":"34202","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84941005017"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84941005017?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84941005017&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84941005017&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84941005017","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84941005017","eid":"2-s2.0-84941005017","dc:title":"A New Quaternion-Based Encryption Method for DICOM Images","dc:creator":"Dzwonkowski M.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","prism:issn":"10577149","prism:volume":"24","prism:issueIdentifier":"11","prism:pageRange":"4614-4622","prism:coverDate":"2015-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 November 2015","prism:doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2467317","dc:description":"In this paper, a new quaternion-based lossless encryption technique for digital image and communication on medicine (DICOM) images is proposed. We have scrutinized and slightly modified the concept of the DICOM network to point out the best location for the proposed encryption scheme, which significantly improves speed of DICOM images encryption in comparison with those originally embedded into DICOM advanced encryption standard and triple data encryption standard algorithms. The proposed algorithm decomposes a DICOM image into two 8-bit gray-tone images in order to perform encryption. The algorithm implements Feistel network like the scheme proposed by Sastry and Kumar. It uses special properties of quaternions to perform rotations of data sequences in 3D space for each of the cipher rounds. The images are written as Lipschitz quaternions, and modular arithmetic was implemented for operations with the quaternions. A computer-based analysis has been carried out, and the obtained results are shown at the end of this paper.","citedby-count":"63","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027012","afid":"60027012","affilname":"Gdańsk University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Gdansk","affiliation-country":"Poland"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012383","afid":"60012383","affilname":"Gdanski Uniwersytet Medyczny","affiliation-city":"Gdańsk","affiliation-country":"Poland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56195739900","authid":"56195739900","authname":"Dzwonkowski M.","surname":"Dzwonkowski","given-name":"Mariusz","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012383"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027012"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57208984812","authid":"57208984812","authname":"Papaj M.","surname":"Papaj","given-name":"Michal","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012383"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6506802907","authid":"6506802907","authname":"Rykaczewski R.","surname":"Rykaczewski","given-name":"Roman","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027012"}]}],"authkeywords":"Cryptography | DICOM | image processing | lossless scheme | medical data | quaternion rotation | security","article-number":"7185411","source-id":"25534","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84940565667"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84940565667?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84940565667&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84940565667&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0096300315011017"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84940565667","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84940565667","eid":"2-s2.0-84940565667","dc:title":"Special least squares solutions of the quaternion matrix equation AX = B with applications","dc:creator":"Zhang F.","prism:publicationName":"Applied Mathematics and Computation","prism:issn":"00963003","prism:volume":"270","prism:pageRange":"425-433","prism:coverDate":"2015-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 November 2015","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.amc.2015.08.046","pii":"S0096300315011017","dc:description":"In this paper, by applying particular structure of the real representations of quaternion matrices and the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse, we derive the expressions of the minimal norm least squares solution, the pure imaginary least squares solution, and the real least squares solution for the quaternion matrix equation AX=B.
