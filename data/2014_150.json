First, a quaternion model of linear symmetric array with two-component electromagnetic (EM) vector sensors is presented. Based on array's quaternion model, we propose the general expression of a quaternion semiwidely linear (QSWL) beamformer. Unlike the complex widely linear beamformer, the QSWL beamformer is based on the simultaneous operation on the quaternion vector, which is composed of two jointly proper complex vectors, and its involution counterpart. Second, we propose a useful implementation of QSWL beamformer, that is, QSWL generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC), and derive the simple expressions of the weight vectors. The QSWL GSC consists of two-stage beamformers. By designing the weight vectors of two-stage beamformers, the interference is completely canceled in the output of QSWL GSC and the desired signal is not distorted. We derive the array's gain expression and analyze the performance of the QSWL GSC in the presence of one type of interference. The advantage of QSWL GSC is that the main beam can always point to the desired signal's direction and the robustness to DOA mismatch is improved. Finally, simulations are used to verify the performance of the proposed QSWL GSC. © 2014 Jian-wu Tao and Wen-xiu Chang.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073486","afid":"60073486","affilname":"Aviation University of Air Force","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007711","afid":"60007711","affilname":"Jilin University","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"24955425","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8534150300","authid":"8534150300","authname":"Tao J.","surname":"Tao","given-name":"Jian Wu","initials":"J.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073486"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13310202400","authid":"13310202400","authname":"Chang W.","surname":"Chang","given-name":"Wen Xiu","initials":"W.X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]}],"article-number":"942923","source-id":"24219","fund-no":"60872088","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84900809101"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84900809101?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84900809101&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84900809101&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84900809101","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84900809101","eid":"2-s2.0-84900809101","dc:title":"Quaternion neural-network-based PolSAR land classification in poincare-sphere-parameter space","dc:creator":"Shang F.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","prism:issn":"01962892","prism:volume":"52","prism:issueIdentifier":"9","prism:pageRange":"5693-5703","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"September 2014","prism:doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2013.2291940","dc:description":"We propose a quaternion neural-network-based land classification in Poincare-sphere-parameter space.

Then, by employing a quaternion feedforward neural network, we generate successful classification results for detecting lake, grass, forest, and town areas. In comparison with the conventional C-matrix-based methods, the proposed method has higher classification performance, especially in detecting forest and town areas. Moreover, the classification result of the proposed method is not influenced by height information.

We choose the quaternion Fourier transform, because it well-suited for color image processing applications, it processes all 3 color components (R,G,B) simultaneously, it capture the inherent correlation between the components, it does not generate color artifacts or blending, finally it does not need an additional color restoration process. Also we introduce a new CEME measure to evaluate the quality of the enhanced color images. Preliminary results show that the α-rooting based on the quaternion Fourier transform enhancement method out-performs other enhancement methods such as the Fourier transform based α-rooting algorithm and the Multi scale Retinex. On top, the new method not only provides true color fidelity for poor quality images but also averages the color components to gray value for balancing colors. It can be used to enhance edge information and sharp features in images, as well as for enhancing even low contrast images. The proposed algorithms are simple to apply and design, which makes them very practical in image enhancement. © 2014 SPIE-IS&T.","citedby-count":"28","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003212","afid":"60003212","affilname":"The University of Texas at San Antonio","affiliation-city":"San Antonio","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006123399","authid":"7006123399","authname":"Grigoryan A.","surname":"Grigoryan","given-name":"Artyom M.","initials":"A.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003212"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003395533","authid":"7003395533","authname":"Agaian S.","surname":"Agaian","given-name":"Sos S.","initials":"S.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003212"}]}],"authkeywords":"Alpha-rooting | Discrete quaternion Fourier transform | Fourier transform | Image enhancement","article-number":"901904","source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84899966204"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84899966204?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84899966204&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84899966204&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0020025514003211"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84899966204","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84899966204","eid":"2-s2.0-84899966204","dc:title":"Quaternion moment and its invariants for color object classification","dc:creator":"Guo L.","prism:publicationName":"Information Sciences","prism:issn":"00200255","prism:volume":"273","prism:pageRange":"132-143","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2014","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.ins.2014.03.037","pii":"S0020025514003211","dc:description":"Moment invariants are important shape descriptors in computer vision. In this study, we propose new sets of quaternion moment descriptors for color image. They are constructed in the quaternion framework and are an extension of complex moment invariants for grayscale images. This is a useful tool in color image processing and color object recognition tasks that require the similarity invariance. The advantage of the proposed quaternion moment invariants is that they can not only process color image in a holistic manner but also grayscale one. In addition, the computational complexity of the proposed method is much lower than the quaternion Zernike moments defined in the polar coordinates. An example of using the quaternion moment invariants as pattern features for a color object classification application is given. Theoretical and experimental results show that the proposed descriptors perform better than the other competing moment-based methods. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The k-nearest neighbor samples extracted from each cluster center are regarded as double weighted training sample sets. Then, the problem of weights inside feature is solved by using modified ReliefF algorithm and correlation measure, and the problem of weights between features is solved by using Support Vector Machine.

First two FrQWT phases encode the shifts of image features in the absolute horizontal and vertical coordinate system, while the third phase has the texture information. The FrQWT allowed a multi-scale framework for calculating and adjusting local disparities and executing phase unwrapping from coarse to fine scales with linear computational efficiency. © 2013 ISA.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031818","afid":"60031818","affilname":"Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee","affiliation-city":"Roorkee","affiliation-country":"India"}],"pubmed-id":"24388356","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56122685600","authid":"56122685600","authname":"Kumar S.","surname":"Kumar","given-name":"Sanoj","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031818"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57220591978","authid":"57220591978","authname":"Kumar S.","surname":"Kumar","given-name":"Sanjeev","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031818"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12804420600","authid":"12804420600","authname":"Sukavanam N.","surname":"Sukavanam","given-name":"Nagarajan","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031818"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23135470700","authid":"23135470700","authname":"Raman B.","surname":"Raman","given-name":"Balasubramanian","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031818"}]}],"authkeywords":"Complex wavelet transform | Disparity estimation | Fractional Hilbert transform | Fractional quaternion wavelet transform | Optical flow | Quaternion algebra","source-id":"29805","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84897588458"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84897588458?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84897588458&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84897588458&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84897588458","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84897588458","eid":"2-s2.0-84897588458","dc:title":"A class of quaternion kalman filters","dc:creator":"Jahanchahi C.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","prism:issn":"2162237X","prism:eIssn":"21622388","prism:volume":"25","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"533-544","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2014","prism:doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2277540","dc:description":"The existing Kalman filters for quaternion-valued signals do not operate fully in the quaternion domain, and are combined with the real Kalman filter to enable the tracking in 3-D spaces. Using the recently introduced HR-calculus, we develop the fully quaternion-valued Kalman filter (QKF) and quaternion-extended Kalman filter (QEKF), allowing for the tracking of 3-D and 4-D signals directly in the quaternion domain. To consider the second-order noncircularity of signals, we employ the recently developed augmented quaternion statistics to derive the widely linear QKF (WL-QKF) and widely linear QEKF (WL-QEKF). To reduce computational requirements of the widely linear algorithms, their efficient implementation are proposed and it is shown that the quaternion widely linear model can be simplified when processing 3-D data, further reducing the computational requirements.

However, in order for external tracking data to be translated into the MR scanner reference frame, the pose of the camera relative to the MR scanner must be known accurately. Here, we describe a fast, accurate, non-iterative technique to determine the position of an external tracking device de novo relative to the MR reference frame. Theory and Methods The method relies on imaging a sparse object that allows simultaneous tracking of arbitrary rigid body transformations in the reference frame of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine and that of the external tracking device. Results Large motions in the MRI reference frame can be measured using a sparse phantom with an accuracy of 0.2 mm, or approximately 1/10 of the voxel size. By using a dual quaternion algorithm to solve the calibration problem, a good camera calibration can be achieved with fewer than six measurements. Further refinements can be achieved by applying the method iteratively and using motion correction feedback. Conclusion Independent tracking of a series of movements in two reference frames allows for an analytical solution to the hand-eye-calibration problem for various motion tracking setups in MRI. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60103674","afid":"60103674","affilname":"Deutsches Zentrum für Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen e.V.","affiliation-city":"Bonn","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020075","afid":"60020075","affilname":"Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology","affiliation-city":"Magdeburg","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019909","afid":"60019909","affilname":"University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee","affiliation-city":"Milwaukee","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018362","afid":"60018362","affilname":"Otto-von-Guericke-Universität Magdeburg","affiliation-city":"Magdeburg","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008308","afid":"60008308","affilname":"John A.

By modulating at least one component of QDFT coefficients, they spread the watermark over two or three of the RGB color channels. However, these schemes do not fully utilize the four-dimensional (4-D) QDFT frequency domain and some also suffer from a watermark energy loss directly at the embedding stage. In this paper, we first establish the links that exist between the DFT of the three RGB color channels and the components of QDFT coefficients while considering a general unit pure quaternion. Then, for different unit pure quaternions i, j, k or their linear combinations, we discuss the symmetry constraints one should follow when modifying QDFT coefficients in order to overcome the previous drawbacks. We also provide a general watermarking framework to illustrate the overall performance gain in terms of imperceptibility, capacity and robustness we can achieve compared to other QDFT based algorithms, i.e. when fully considering the 4-D QDFT domain. From this framework we derive three schemes, depending on whether i, j or k is used. Provided theoretical analysis and experimental results show that these algorithms offer better performance in terms of capacity and robustness to most common attacks, including JPEG compression, noise, cropping and filtering and so on, than other QDFT based algorithms for the same watermarked image quality. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","citedby-count":"109","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60110235","afid":"60110235","affilname":"IMT Atlantique","affiliation-city":"Nantes","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60105589","afid":"60105589","affilname":"Laboratoire Traitement du Signal et de l'Image","affiliation-city":"Rennes","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143","afid":"60064143","affilname":"Nanjing University of Information Science &amp;

As validation, these quaternionic OMP algorithms are applied to simulated data. Denoising and deconvolution are carried out and presented here using a new spikegram that is designed for visualization of quaternionic coefficients. Finally these quaternionic OMPs are compared to multivariate OMP. © 2013 Springer Basel.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104170","afid":"60104170","affilname":"Grenoble Images Parole Signal Automatique","affiliation-city":"Saint Martin d'Heres","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007816","afid":"60007816","affilname":"Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives","affiliation-city":"Gif-sur-Yvette","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/50361026200","authid":"50361026200","authname":"Barthélemy Q.","surname":"Barthélemy","given-name":"Quentin","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007816"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13007441000","authid":"13007441000","authname":"Larue A.","surname":"Larue","given-name":"Anthony","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007816"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004216193","authid":"7004216193","authname":"Mars J.","surname":"Mars","given-name":"Jérôme I.","initials":"J.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104170"}]}],"authkeywords":"orthogonal matching pursuit | Quaternionic signal processing | sparse approximation","source-id":"4900152804","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84893166483"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84893166483?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84893166483&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84893166483&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84893166483","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84893166483","eid":"2-s2.0-84893166483","dc:title":"Moments-based stereo camera egomotion analysis and results for long-range trajectories","dc:creator":"Rodriguez D.","prism:publicationName":"Imaging Science Journal","prism:issn":"13682199","prism:eIssn":"1743131X","prism:volume":"62","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"35-41","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"January 2014","prism:doi":"10.1179/1743131X12Y.0000000034","dc:description":"This paper presents an effective egomotion approach based on high curvature features extracted from moment images and described using local descriptiors from the original images.

Logistic map generates a matrix to mix four images and 3-D cat is also used to scramble images after piling up the pixels of each image to cubes. The proposed scheme can encrypt not only four images but also three images and so on if one sets some parts of quaternion as zero. The scheme has large key space and is sensitive to keys.

We assume feature points and background eliminated images are provided, and we get different views of a tracked object when the object is stationary. Using different views of a tracked object, we volume-reconstruct a 3D model body after 3D scene analysis. For computing camera parameters and target object movement for a scene with a moving target object, we use fixed feature background points, and convert as a parameter optimization problem solving. Performance index for parameter optimization is minimizing feature point errors as well as outline contour difference between reconstructed 3D model and background eliminated tracked object.

However, they mainly utilize the monochromatic intensity information. Among a few color face recognition methods, most of them treat the three channels separately. In this paper, a color face image is treated in a holistic manner by using the quaternion theory. We then propose a new algorithm for color face recognition, which uses the quaternion Zernike moment invariants and the quaternion BP neural network for the color face recognition. Experimental results on the Collection of Facial Images (Grimace) database, including major expression variation and considerable variation in head turn and tilt, show that the proposed method is better than the conventional ones in recognition rate. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143","afid":"60064143","affilname":"Nanjing University of Information Science &amp; Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005244","afid":"60005244","affilname":"Southeast University","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36805188500","authid":"36805188500","authname":"Chen B.J.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Bei Jing","initials":"B.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7203086899","authid":"7203086899","authname":"Shu H.Z.","surname":"Shu","given-name":"Hua Zhong","initials":"H.Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58464954900","authid":"58464954900","authname":"Chen G.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Gang","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35797122600","authid":"35797122600","authname":"Ge J.","surname":"Ge","given-name":"Jun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color face recognition | Moment invariants | Quaternion BP neural network | Quaternion Zernike moment","source-id":"4700151914","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84891060098"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84891060098?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84891060098&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84891060098&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84891060098","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84891060098","eid":"2-s2.0-84891060098","dc:title":"2013 2nd International Conference on Sensors, Measurement and Intelligent Materials, ICSMIM 2013","prism:publicationName":"Applied Mechanics and Materials","prism:issn":"16609336","prism:eIssn":"16627482","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783037859711"}],"prism:volume":"475-476","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2014","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 343 papers.

In this paper, we propose a new method using phase spectrum of Quaternion Fourier Transform to enhance small targets while suppressing backgrounds for infrared images. This is inspired by the property that regularly Gaussian-like shape small targets could be considered as attractively salient signal in infrared images and the location information of such signal is implicitly contained in the phase spectrum from frequency domain. Formally, in the proposed method, we adopt the phase spectrum of Quaternion Fourier Transform instead of using traditional Fourier Transform to enhance the targets since the quaternion provides at most four data channels than only one for the latter, which could be helpful to broad types of background clutters by adding more information. For the construction of the quaternion, we present a second-order directional derivative filter via facet model to compute four second order directional derivative maps from four directions respectively as the four data channels. This filter is used to suppress noises and distinguish the targets and backgrounds into separably different textures so that it would boost the robustness of small target enhancement. In experiments, some typical infrared images with various scenes are tested to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that our method actually has good performance and outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, which can be further used for infrared small target detection and tracking. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, the fusion result is not ideal due to the difficulty in focus region segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel region level based multifocus image fusion method that can locate the boundary of the focus region accurately. As a novel tool of image analysis, phases in the quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) are capable of representing the texture information in the image. We use the local variance of the phases to detect the focus or defocus for every pixel initially. Then, we segment the focus detection result by the normalized cut to remove detection errors, thus initial fusion result is acquired through copying from source images according to the focus detection results. Next, we compare initial fusion result with spatial frequency weighted fusion result to accurately locate the boundary of the focus region by structural similarity. Finally, the fusion result is obtained using spatial frequency as fusion weight along the boundary of the focus region. Furthermore, we conduct several experiments to verify the feasibility of the fusion framework. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated superior to the reference methods.","citedby-count":"94","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021615","afid":"60021615","affilname":"Harbin Medical University","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/47962202000","authid":"47962202000","authname":"Liu Y.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Yipeng","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56768579700","authid":"56768579700","authname":"Jin J.","surname":"Jin","given-name":"Jing","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57199479168","authid":"57199479168","authname":"Wang Q.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Qiang","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9636704800","authid":"9636704800","authname":"Shen Y.","surname":"Shen","given-name":"Yi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57225855467","authid":"57225855467","authname":"Dong X.","surname":"Dong","given-name":"Xiaoqiu","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021615"}]}],"authkeywords":"Focus region detection | Multifocus image fusion | Normalized cut | Quaternion wavelet | Spatial frequency | Structural similarity","source-id":"25548","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"60901043","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
