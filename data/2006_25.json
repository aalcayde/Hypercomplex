The attitude and flexible dynamics equations for a class of spacecraft is presented. The resulting nonlinear and coupled equations of the system are implemented into a high-fidelity user-friendly simulation environment. The simulator is used for the investigation of attitude recovery of flexible spacecraft using the feedback linearization approach. Since the flexible spacecraft is underactuated, the input-output linearization technique was specifically used to break up the system into two distinct parts, namely 1) an external linearizable system for which a linear controller can be easily implemented, and 2) an internal nonlinear unobservable system for which the associated zero dynamics is shown to be asymptotically stable for two representative cases. The overall closed-loop stability of the flexible spacecraft is analyzed rigorously and shown to be asymptotically stable using Lyapunov's method. © 2006 IEEE.","citedby-count":"52","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033154","afid":"60033154","affilname":"Concordia University","affiliation-city":"Montreal","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16318045800","authid":"16318045800","authname":"Tafazoli S.","surname":"Tafazoli","given-name":"S.","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033154"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033154"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26642977400","authid":"26642977400","authname":"Khorasani K.","surname":"Khorasani","given-name":"K.","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033154"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033154"}]}],"source-id":"17336","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33846218144"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33846218144?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33846218144&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33846218144&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33846218144","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:33846218144","eid":"2-s2.0-33846218144","dc:title":"Wavelet Applications in Industrial Processing IV","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","prism:issn":"0277786X","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"0819464813"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780819464811"}],"prism:volume":"6383","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2006-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2006","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 22 papers.

In this paper we propose a quaternionic wavelet transform aimed to colour image processing. To encode colour information in our new transformation, a pixel in the spatial domain is represented by a quaternion as described by Sangwine. First, we propose to use the discrete quaternionic Fourier transform to study the spectral information of the colour image. It is well known that the frequency space of a real signal is a complex hermitian signal, we then studied the digital spectral domain of the quaternionic Fourier transform in order to analyze symmetry properties. This study gives us one characterization of the colour Fourier domain. Second we use the quaternion formalism to define a wavelet transform for colour images. We propose to generalize the filter bank construction to quaternionic formalism. Especially, we describe conditions on quaternionic filters to obtain a perfect reconstruction. We build a first colour quaternionic filter bank: the colour Shannon Wavelet. This family of functions are based on a windowing process in the quaternionic Fourier space.","citedby-count":"14","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032653","afid":"60032653","affilname":"Universite de Poitiers","affiliation-city":"Poitiers","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36008284700","authid":"36008284700","authname":"Carré P.","surname":"Carré","given-name":"Philippe","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032653"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15764750200","authid":"15764750200","authname":"Denis P.","surname":"Denis","given-name":"Patrice","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032653"}]}],"authkeywords":"Colour images | Filter bank | Fourier | Quaternion","article-number":"638301","source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33845299187"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33845299187?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33845299187&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33845299187&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33845299187","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:33845299187","eid":"2-s2.0-33845299187","dc:title":"Using complex and hypercomplex systems in image and signal processing","dc:creator":"Furman Y.A.","prism:publicationName":"Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis","prism:issn":"10546618","prism:eIssn":"15556212","prism:volume":"16","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"659-670","prism:coverDate":"2006-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2006","prism:doi":"10.1134/S1054661806040134","dc:description":"New approaches to processing of dense and point images are presented.

Our algorithm initially recovers the global spatial mismatch between the reference and floating images, followed by hierarchical octree-based subdivision of the reference image and independent registration of the floating image with the individual subvolumes of the reference image at each hierarchical level. Global as well as local registrations use the six-parameter full rigid-body transformation model and are based on maximization of normalized mutual information (NMI). To ensure robustness of the subvolume registration with low voxel counts, we calculate NMI using a combination of current and prior mutual histograms. To generate a smooth deformation field, we perform direct interpolation of six-parameter rigid-body subvolume transformations obtained at the last subdivision level. Our interpolation scheme involves scalar interpolation of the 3D translations and quaternion interpolation of the 3D rotational pose. We analyzed the performance of our algorithm through experiments involving registration of synthetically deformed computed tomography (CT) images. Our algorithm is general and can be applied to image pairs of any two modalities of most organs. We have demonstrated successful registration of clinical whole-body CT and positron emission tomography (PET) images using this algorithm. The registration accuracy for this application was evaluated, based on validation using expert-identified anatomical landmarks in 15 CT-PET image pairs. The algorithm's performance was comparable to the average accuracy observed for three expert-determined registrations in the same 15 image pairs. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This paper proposed a flexible and reliable camera calibration of stereo photogrammetric system based on quaternion with one-dimensional optical reference bar, which has three small collinear infrared LED marks and the lengths between these marks have been precisely calibration. By moving the optical reference bar at a number of locations/orientations over the measurement volume, we calibrate the stereo photogrammetric systems with the geometric constraint of the optical reference bar. The extrinsic parameters calibration process consists of linear parameters estimation based on quaternion and nonlinear refinement based on the maximum likelihood criterion. Firstly, we linear estimate the extrinsic parameters of the stereo photogrameetric systems based on quaternion. Then with the quaternion results as the initial values, we refine the extrinsic parameters through maximum likelihood criterion with the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm. In the calibration process, we can automatically control the light intensity and optimize the exposure time to get uniform intensity profile of the image points at different distance and obtain higher S/N ratio. The experiment result proves that the calibration method proposed is flexible, valid and obtains good results in the application. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024758","afid":"60024758","affilname":"Harbin University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403743438","authid":"7403743438","authname":"Xu Q.Y.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Q.

These 3-D eye rotations are constrained to patterns such as Listing's law, or its generalisation 'L2', according to the context. Our understanding of the patterns of such three-dimensional eye rotations, and their effect on the retinal images, has been greatly advanced by the development of algebraic methods (Haustein, 1989; Tweed & Vilis, 1987; Westheimer, 1957) for calculating the effect of eye rotations. But not many would say, with Dirac, that they understand the equations describing the 3-D geometry in the sense that they have \"a way of figuring out the characteristic of its solution without actually solving it\" (Dirac, according to Feynman, Leighton, & Sands, 1964). I show here how the geometry of 3-D rotations of the eye and their visual effects can be made easier to understand by use of the principle that a rotation through angle α can be achieved by a pair of reflections in planes with an angular separation α/2, and a common line that is the rotation axis (Tweed, 1997b; Tweed, Cadera, & Vilis, 1990).

Parameterized inputs allow the algorithms to be readily adapted to any sensor of opportunity. The cornerstone of our approach is the ability to simulate realistic range data that may be tailored to the specifications of any sensor. We were able to modify an open-source raytracing package to produce point cloud information from which high-fidelity simulated range images are generated. The assumptions made in our experimentation are as follows: 1) we have access to a CAD model of the target including information about the surface scattering and reflection characteristics of the components; 2) the satellite of interest may appear at any 3-D attitude; 3) the target is not necessarily rigid, but does have a limited number of configurations; and, 4) the target is not obscured in any way and is the only object in the field of view of the sensor. Our pose estimation approach then involves rendering a large number of exemplars (100k to 5M), extracting 2-D (silhouette- and projection-based) and 3-D (surface-based) features, and then training ensembles of decision trees to predict: a) the 4-D regions on a unit hypersphere into which the unit quaternion that represents the vehicle [QX, QY, Q Z, QW] is pointing, and, b) the components of that unit quaternion. Results have been quite promising and the tools and simulation environment developed for this application may also be applied to non-cooperative spacecraft operations, Autonomous Hazard Detection and Avoidance (AHDA) for landing craft, terrain mapping, vehicle guidance, path planning and obstacle avoidance.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100328762","afid":"100328762","affilname":"Michigan Aerospace Corporation","affiliation-city":"Ann Arbor","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6601945853","authid":"6601945853","authname":"Trenkle J.","surname":"Trenkle","given-name":"John M.","initials":"J.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"100328762"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602941336","authid":"6602941336","authname":"Tchoryk P.","surname":"Tchoryk","given-name":"Peter","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"100328762"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57197920894","authid":"57197920894","authname":"Ritter G.","surname":"Ritter","given-name":"Greg A.","initials":"G.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"100328762"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602812580","authid":"6602812580","authname":"Pavlich J.","surname":"Pavlich","given-name":"Jane C.","initials":"J.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"100328762"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14068866300","authid":"14068866300","authname":"Hickerson A.","surname":"Hickerson","given-name":"Aaron S.","initials":"A.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"100328762"}]}],"authkeywords":"3-D | Autonomous | Bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) | Ensembles of decision trees | Image processing | Machine learning | Pose determination | Quaternions | Range data | Rendezvous and docking","article-number":"62200D","source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33748925741"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33748925741?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33748925741&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33748925741&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33748925741","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:33748925741","eid":"2-s2.0-33748925741","dc:title":"New algorithm of solving for ranges during final approach of spacecraft rendezvous","dc:creator":"Zhu R.","prism:publicationName":"Beijing Hangkong Hangtian Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics","prism:issn":"10015965","prism:volume":"32","prism:issueIdentifier":"7","prism:pageRange":"764-768","prism:coverDate":"2006-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2006","dc:description":"A new algorithm of solving for ranges during the final translation phase of spacecraft rendezvous and docking using computer vision system was presented to determine relative attitude and position between target and chase spacecraft by Quaternion Estimation.

For both non-planar (such as three-point T-type and five-point pyramid type) and co-planar patterns (such as square, rectangle and rhombus), the objective function contained terms concerning ratios of distances between the target spots; but for co-planar targets, the objective function had another terms which describe co-planar feature. Gauss-Newton method was applied to solve for the optimum range solutions of the least squares problem. For quadrilateral patterns, the initial values for iterations were given by coordinates of virtual image of the intersection point of two diagonal lines.

The attitude control system on the satellite is used to steer the satellite using commands from the groundstation and a television camera onboard the satellite will then downlink a television signal in real time to a monitor screen in the ground station. The operator in the feedback loop will be able to manually steer the boresight of the satellite's main imager towards interested target areas e.g. to avoid clouds or correct for any attitude pointing errors. Due to a substantial delay (in the order of a second) in the view finding feedback loop and the narrow field of view of the main imager, the operator has to be assisted by the onboard attitude control system to stabilise and track the target area visible on the monitor screen. This paper will present an extended Kalman filter used to estimate the satellite's attitude angles using quaternions and the bias vector component of the 3-axis inertial rate sensors (gyros). Absolute attitude sensors (i.e. sun, horizon and magnetic) are used to supply the measurement vectors to correct the filter states during the view finder manoeuvres.

In the case of two-dimensional transform the spectrum is calculated for pairs of frequencies, instead of conventional sequence of one-dimensional transforms. Therefore, it enables one to Fourier transform arbitrarily sampled time domain and thus allows for analysis of high dimensionality spectra acquired in a short time. The proposed method is not limited to radial sampling, it requires only to fulfill the Nyquist theorem considering two or more time domains at the same time.

The quaternion model is used, and a data covariance model is proposed using quaternion formalism.

Consequently, a MUSIC-like algorithm is presented, allowing estimation of wave's DOAs and polarization parameters. The algorithm is tested in numerical simulations, and performance analysis is conducted. When compared with other MUSIC-like algorithms for vector-sensor array, the newly proposed algorithm results in a reduction by half of memory requirements for representation of data covariance model and reduces the computational effort, for equivalent performance.

Among the two accelerometers, the first one is a 3-DOF micro accelerometer utilizing piezoresistive effect in single crystal silicon. The sensing structure consists of four sensing-beams surrounding a seismic-mass. Therefore, the sensor is smaller than the cross-beam type accelerometer. The second accelerometer is a dual axis thermal accelerometer, working based on the thermo-resistive effect of silicon thermistors in free convective regime. Since no seismic mass is used, the shock-resistance becomes very high (up to 9.0×106g). The novel structure of the thermistors eliminated up to 93% of stress induced by temperature. The dual-axis gas gyroscope proposed here is working based on the thermo-resistive effect of light-doped silicon thermistor and the force convective heat transfer. The sensor configuration consists of a gas pump and a micro thermistor sensing element, packaged in an aluminum case with overall diameter and length of 14mm and 25mm, respectively. Unlike vibrating gyroscopes reported recently in MEMS-field, our gyroscope has \"no\" seismic mass; therefore it can eliminate the inherent problems such as fragility, low shock-resistance, squeezed-film air-damping, etc. Moreover, since the driving power for the moving mass is not necessary, the power consumption is also reduced. Finally, an algorithm to process the signal from a system consists of a 3-DOF accelerometer and 3-DOF gyroscope is presented. In this algorithm, quaternion based calculation was applied instead of Euler angles, therefore the problems of singularity or complicated trigonometric calculations can be avoided. The algorithm can be applied for inertial navigation systems (INS).","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60272632","afid":"60272632","affilname":"Tamagawa Seiki Co., Ltd.","affiliation-city":"Iida","affiliation-country":"Japan"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60105159","afid":"60105159","affilname":"Ritsumeikan University Biwako-Kusatsu Campus","affiliation-city":"Kusatsu","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003753680","authid":"7003753680","authname":"Dao D.V.","surname":"Dao","given-name":"Dzung V.","initials":"D.V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60105159"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9332860000","authid":"9332860000","authname":"Van Dau T.","surname":"Van Dau","given-name":"T.","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60105159"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9334132200","authid":"9334132200","authname":"Shiozawa T.","surname":"Shiozawa","given-name":"Tatsuo","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60272632"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24722763700","authid":"24722763700","authname":"Kumagai H.","surname":"Kumagai","given-name":"Hideo","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60272632"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402030853","authid":"7402030853","authname":"Sugiyama S.","surname":"Sugiyama","given-name":"Susumu","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60105159"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60105159"}]}],"authkeywords":"Accelerometer | Gyroscope | MEMS Technology | Motion sensors | Piezoresistive | Thermo-resistive","article-number":"60370K","source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33645156716"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33645156716?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33645156716&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33645156716&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33645156716","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:33645156716","eid":"2-s2.0-33645156716","dc:title":"Singular value feature extraction of color image and its application for recognition","dc:creator":"Ran R.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","prism:issn":"0277786X","prism:volume":"6033","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2006-03-30","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2006","prism:doi":"10.1117/12.668082","dc:description":"A new tool of feature extraction and recognition of color image is introduced.

The Pointing, Acquisition, and Tracking (PAT) system is required to compensate for the vibrations applied to the optical platform while the vehicle carrying the optical instrumentation navigates through rough terrain. The degradation of the performance of the communication system is mitigated through the proper application of advanced control laws. A feedforward vibration rejection control system presented in this paper utilizes a set of inertial navigation sensors to measure the optical platform orientation disturbance and calculates the control effort that drives the actuators of the Omni-Wrist III, a novel singularity-free full-hemisphere-range robotic manipulator. The signals from the inertial navigational unit, consisting of a 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis acceler-ometer, and a 3-axis magnetic sensor, are 'fused' to form a quaternion representation of the orientation of the optical platform. This paper presents the development of an Extended Kalman filter 'fusing' the inertial navigation sensor data, the design and implementation of the disturbance rejection control system, as well as the results of the experimental evaluation of its performance in which the system is subjected to vibrations spectra representing the navigation of the Humvee in difficult terrain.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020273","afid":"60020273","affilname":"Binghamton University State University of New York","affiliation-city":"Binghamton","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6506937771","authid":"6506937771","authname":"Sofka J.","surname":"Sofka","given-name":"Jozef","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020273"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003286964","authid":"7003286964","authname":"Skormin V.","surname":"Skormin","given-name":"Victor","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020273"}]}],"authkeywords":"Kalman filter | MARG | Omni-Wrist III | Platform stabilization | Quaternions","source-id":"21100349117","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/41649109803"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/41649109803?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=41649109803&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=41649109803&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/41649109803","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:41649109803","eid":"2-s2.0-41649109803","dc:title":"Modeling dual polarization wireless fading channels using quaternions","dc:creator":"Wysocki B.J.","prism:publicationName":"SympoTIC'06 - Joint 1st Workshop on Sensor Networks and Symposium on Trends in Communications","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"1424403685"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781424403684"}],"prism:pageRange":"68-71","prism:coverDate":"2006-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2006","prism:doi":"10.1109/tic.2006.1708024","dc:description":"In the letter we describe signal transmitted between two dual-polarized antennas using a quaternion notation. The channel can then be modeled by a single quaternion gain, instead of a matrix of four complex gains as it is done in a classical approach. The model is very useful as it allows for a simple accommodation of any polarization twist between the transmit and receive antennas, as well as, modeling random fading in both polarizations with or without cross-polar scattering. © 2006 IEEE.","citedby-count":"22","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011664","afid":"60011664","affilname":"University of Wollongong","affiliation-city":"Wollongong","affiliation-country":"Australia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000251","afid":"60000251","affilname":"IEEE","affiliation-city":"New York","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701442353","authid":"6701442353","authname":"Wysocki B.J.","surname":"Wysocki","given-name":"B.
