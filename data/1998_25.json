This paper makes two contributions in the context of the 3-D CAP system. First, the QAM equivalent for the three-dimensional case is introduced by extending the 2-D complex notation into a 3-D vector notation. The definition is a modification of the well known quaternions. Second, the 3-D QAM filtering is redefined using algorithmic strength reduction to reduce the overall complexity by about one third with marginal degradation. The 3-D QAM system using 9 filters performs almost exactly as the 3-D CAP. Further complexity reduction is achieved by exploiting filtering reduction at the expense of only one dB of receiver SNR degradation.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029445","afid":"60029445","affilname":"University of Minnesota Twin Cities","affiliation-city":"Minneapolis","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602108723","authid":"6602108723","authname":"Shalash A.","surname":"Shalash","given-name":"Ahmed F.","initials":"A.F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029445"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102542319","authid":"7102542319","authname":"Parhi K.","surname":"Parhi","given-name":"Keshab K.","initials":"K.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029445"}]}],"source-id":"56190","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
