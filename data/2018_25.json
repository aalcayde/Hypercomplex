Most algorithms used worldwide employ Zero Velocity Update (ZUPT) to reduce the tremendous error of integration from acceleration to displacement. The crucial part in ZUPT is to detect stance phase precisely. A cyclic left-to-right style Hidden Markov Model is introduced in this work which is able to appropriately model the periodic nature of signals. Stance detection is then made unsupervised by using a suited learning algorithm. Then orientation estimation is performed independently by a quaternion-based method, a simplified error-state Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) assists trajectory reconstruction in 3D space, neither extra method nor prior knowledge is needed to estimate the height. Experimental results on large free-walking trajectories show that the proposed algorithm can provide more accurate locations, especially in z-axis compared to competitive algorithms, w.r.t. to a ground-truth obtained using OpenStreetMap.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60187109","afid":"60187109","affilname":"EPITA","affiliation-city":"Le Kremlin-Bicetre","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60106017","afid":"60106017","affilname":"Université Paris-Saclay","affiliation-city":"Gif-sur-Yvette","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030981","afid":"60030981","affilname":"École Centrale de Lyon","affiliation-city":"Ecully","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56374821400","authid":"56374821400","authname":"Li H.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Haoyu","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030981"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56058137700","authid":"56058137700","authname":"Derrode S.","surname":"Derrode","given-name":"Stéphane","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030981"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23096962100","authid":"23096962100","authname":"Benyoussef L.","surname":"Benyoussef","given-name":"Lamia","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60187109"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003996049","authid":"7003996049","authname":"Pieczynski W.","surname":"Pieczynski","given-name":"Wojciech","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60106017"}]}],"authkeywords":"Hidden Markov model | Inertial sensor | Kalman filter | Pedestrian navigation | Stance detection","article-number":"8553462","source-id":"21100204301","fund-acr":"CSC","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"China Scholarship Council","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85060065969"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85060065969?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85060065969&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85060065969&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85060065969","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85060065969","eid":"2-s2.0-85060065969","dc:title":"Parking Space Detection Using Quaternionic Local Ranking Binary Pattern","dc:creator":"Antoni Suwignyo M.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - 2018 International Seminar on Application for Technology of Information and Communication: Creative Technology for Human Life, iSemantic 2018","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538674864"}],"prism:pageRange":"351-355","prism:coverDate":"2018-11-27","prism:coverDisplayDate":"27 November 2018","prism:doi":"10.1109/ISEMANTIC.2018.8549756","dc:description":"In the digital age, some places have been installed with a surveillance camera, especially in a parking lot.

It is necessary to maintain security for images such as medical, military, etc. So far many research work have been developed in the field of image information security and prevention. However the achieved level of security is not satisfactory, thus still this field is in research to find a better solution for the image data secu-rity and prevention. In this sense, this research is targeted to develop a better strategy for the image data prevention and se-curity enhancement. There are many cryptography technique is available in the technical world, however this work adapted quaternion based approach for the image data security. Qua-ternion is a kind of number notation, it is the combination of both scalar and vector. Quaternion rotation is the concept ap-plied in the image encryption for the security purpose. In the existing works authors have applied the Quaternion rotation based encryption of medical image and color images. In order to further enhance the performance of encryption, in this work the Quaternion Fourier Transform is applied. The Fourier transform based Quaternion rotation improves the performance in both security and computation. The proposed system is implemented using the working platform of MATLAB, and the performance is compared with the conventional quaternion technique. The proposed system provided better performance based on the comparative analysis with respect to correlation coefficient, avalanche effect, computational speed, normalized correlation and histogram.","citedby-count":"17","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/121763411","afid":"121763411","affilname":"Toc H Institute of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Ernakulam","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/107961522","afid":"107961522","affilname":"Satyam College of Engineering and Technology","affiliation-city":"Nagercoil","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56997164300","authid":"56997164300","authname":"Karthick S.","surname":"Karthick","given-name":"S.","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"107961522"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195410521","authid":"57195410521","authname":"Perumal Sankar S.","surname":"Perumal Sankar","given-name":"S.","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"121763411"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57151495300","authid":"57151495300","authname":"Raja Prathab T.","surname":"Raja Prathab","given-name":"T.","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"107961522"}]}],"authkeywords":"Image decryption | Image encryption | Quaternion fourier transform | Quaternion rotation","article-number":"8529014","source-id":"21100890909","fund-no":"DP130101870","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85061143467"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85061143467?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85061143467&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85061143467&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85061143467","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85061143467","eid":"2-s2.0-85061143467","dc:title":"Aerial image matching based on NSST and quaternion exponential moment","dc:creator":"Wang H.","prism:publicationName":"International Journal of Performability Engineering","prism:issn":"09731318","prism:volume":"14","prism:issueIdentifier":"11","prism:pageRange":"2663-2673","prism:coverDate":"2018-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2018","prism:doi":"10.23940/ijpe.18.11.p12.26632673","dc:description":"In this paper, we propose an aerial image matching algorithm based on NSST and quaternion exponential moment. Firstly, we use non-subsampled shearlet transform (NSST) to decompose the reference image and the to-be-matched image, and the scale invariant feature with error resilience (SIFER) operator is used to extract stable feature points from NSST low-frequency sub-bands and construct local feature areas respectively. Subsequently, local features of each feature area are solved by quaternion exponential moment to constitute feature vectors of such feature points for pre-matching. In the end, mismatching point pairs are removed by the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. Finally, experimental results show that compared with the SIFT and SURF algorithms, the algorithm proposed in this paper makes faster operations, has higher matching precision, and is significantly better than the other two methods in resisting rotation, noise, brightness change, and integrated disturbance.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104677","afid":"60104677","affilname":"North China Institute of Aerospace Engineering","affiliation-city":"LangFang","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55265300800","authid":"55265300800","authname":"Wang H.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Huan","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104677"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58374713600","authid":"58374713600","authname":"Jia Z.","surname":"Jia","given-name":"Zhenhua","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104677"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205697051","authid":"57205697051","authname":"Zhang Y.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Yunfeng","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104677"}]}],"authkeywords":"Image matching | Non-subsampled shearlet transform | Quaternion exponential moment | Scale invariant feature with error resilience","source-id":"17500155116","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85057974339"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85057974339?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85057974339&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85057974339&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85057974339","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85057974339","eid":"2-s2.0-85057974339","dc:title":"Quaternion structure of azimuthal instabilities","dc:creator":"Ghirardo G.","prism:publicationName":"Physical Review Fluids","prism:eIssn":"2469990X","prism:volume":"3","prism:issueIdentifier":"11","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2018-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2018","prism:doi":"10.1103/PhysRevFluids.3.113202","dc:description":"Rotationally symmetric systems can exhibit acoustic fluctuations in the azimuthal direction. In experimental works the nature (standing or spinning) of these fluctuations is often described by a set of indicators. These indicators either depend on the chosen frame of reference or are not state space variables for the acoustic field. Conversely, in theoretical works the field is projected on two orthogonal modes, and the system is characterized in terms of two amplitudes and one phase difference. Also in these works the nature of the field is not a state space variable but a derived quantity. Moreover the phase difference between the two modes is undetermined when one of the amplitudes of the two modes is zero, making the phase space ill-posed. We present a solution to these limitations, and we show how the acoustic field can be embedded in quaternion algebra, by calculating a suitable analytic signal of the complex-valued embedding of the acoustic field. This allows us to map the state of the system to a point that moves as function of time on a two-dimensional sphere in three-dimensional (3D) space, the Poincaré-Bloch sphere. To each state of the system corresponds just one point in this 3D space, which is then a well-posed phase space. We term the spherical coordinates of the point the amplitude of oscillation, the nature angle, and the orientation angle. The amplitude of oscillation of the system is the radius of the sphere. The nature angle is the latitude angle and positions the point closer to the equator (pure standing mode states) or closer to the poles (pure spinning mode states). The orientation angle is the longitude angle and describes the position of the pressure antinodes of the part of the acoustic field that is standing. These coordinates have a straightforward physical interpretation, can be easily calculated from experimental data, and are at the same time state space variables of a simple and elegant ansatz that can be used in low-order models. We also present an example of characterization of an experimental azimuthal thermoacoustic instability.","citedby-count":"19","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60113409","afid":"60113409","affilname":"Ansaldo Energia Switzerland AG","affiliation-city":"Baden","affiliation-country":"Switzerland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55853534800","authid":"55853534800","authname":"Ghirardo G.","surname":"Ghirardo","given-name":"Giulio","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60113409"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15057629600","authid":"15057629600","authname":"Bothien M.R.","surname":"Bothien","given-name":"Mirko R.","initials":"M.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60113409"}]}],"article-number":"113201","source-id":"21100836848","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85053065889"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85053065889?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85053065889&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85053065889&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0094576517316065"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85053065889","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85053065889","eid":"2-s2.0-85053065889","dc:title":"Semi-autonomous attitude guidance using relative navigation based on line of sight measurements – Aim scenario","dc:creator":"Pellacani A.","prism:publicationName":"Acta Astronautica","prism:issn":"00945765","prism:volume":"152","prism:pageRange":"496-508","prism:coverDate":"2018-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2018","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.08.051","pii":"S0094576517316065","dc:description":"The Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM) is an ESA small mission of opportunity that intends to travel to the binary asteroid Didymos to assess planetary defence capabilities in the context of the AIDA program, in collaboration with NASA, to demonstrate new technologies for future exploration missions to asteroids and to perform scientific observations. The AIM spacecraft is described in the paper, focusing on the vision-based GNC strategy that reached a high level of maturity at the end of the Consolidation Phase (post B1). Ground navigation analyses pointed out that for close proximity operations (distances under 20 km) a certain degree of autonomy is required. A semi-autonomous attitude guidance has been developed to guarantee that the asteroid will always be kept in the camera Field of View. This algorithm will apply a delta quaternion to the reference attitude profile provided by ground control in order to correct the pointing to the body. This technology has been designed to be easily validated and, at the same time, constrained: the delta quaternion can be limited and in case the thresholds are crossed or any failure occurs, the ground-based reference attitude profile will be used. The AIM GNC prototype was updated to use Line of Sight measurements provided by a centroiding algorithm designed and autocoded in Matlab/Simulink, then validated up to Processor-in-the-loop tests using a flight-representative processor (AT697E LEON2-FT @ 80 MHz). The algorithm is based on the correlation of the image with a Lambertian sphere, taking advantage of the almost spherical shape of Didymain. When relative distance to the binary system is below 8 km, the feature tracking algorithm is used. In this paper a specific case is assessed: the close fly-by for MASCOT-2 delivery (lander included in the payload for AIM's phase B1), tested up to Hardware-in-the-loop with the AIM Framing Camera.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60085129","afid":"60085129","affilname":"OHB System AG","affiliation-city":"Bremen","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60069934","afid":"60069934","affilname":"GMV S.A.","affiliation-city":"Tres Cantos","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56288605800","authid":"56288605800","authname":"Pellacani A.","surname":"Pellacani","given-name":"Andrea","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069934"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190438856","authid":"57190438856","authname":"Cabral F.","surname":"Cabral","given-name":"Francisco","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069934"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203368200","authid":"57203368200","orcid":"0000-0002-9284-941X","authname":"Alcalde A.","surname":"Alcalde","given-name":"Aída","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069934"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55759963400","authid":"55759963400","authname":"Kicman P.","surname":"Kicman","given-name":"Pawel","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069934"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205862167","authid":"57205862167","authname":"Lisowski J.","surname":"Lisowski","given-name":"Jakub","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069934"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55318523200","authid":"55318523200","orcid":"0000-0002-8408-1682","authname":"Gerth I.","surname":"Gerth","given-name":"Ingo","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60085129"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56732832400","authid":"56732832400","authname":"Burmann B.","surname":"Burmann","given-name":"Bastian","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60085129"}]}],"authkeywords":"Asteroid impact | Autonomous GNC | HIL | Optical navigation | PIL | Planetary defense","source-id":"12372","fund-acr":"ESA","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Estech","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85051006294"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85051006294?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85051006294&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85051006294&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0968432818300982"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85051006294","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85051006294","eid":"2-s2.0-85051006294","dc:title":"A study about color normalization methods for histopathology images","dc:creator":"Roy S.","prism:publicationName":"Micron","prism:issn":"09684328","prism:volume":"114","prism:pageRange":"42-61","prism:coverDate":"2018-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 November 2018","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.micron.2018.07.005","pii":"S0968432818300982","dc:description":"Histopathology images are used for the diagnosis of the cancerous disease by the examination of tissue with the help of Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanner.

In this paper, detailed study and performance evaluation of color normalization methods on histopathology image datasets are presented. Color normalization of the source image by transferring the mean color of the target image in the source image and also to separate stain present in the source image. Stain separation and color normalization of the histopathology images can be helped for both pathology and computerized decision support system. Quality performances of different color normalization methods are evaluated and compared in terms of quaternion structure similarity index matrix (QSSIM), structure similarity index matrix (SSIM) and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) on various histopathology image datasets. Our experimental analysis suggests that structure-preserving color normalization (SPCN) provides better qualitatively and qualitatively results in comparison to the all the presented methods for breast and colorectal cancer histopathology image datasets.","citedby-count":"91","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016017","afid":"60016017","affilname":"Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore","affiliation-city":"Mangalore","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004954","afid":"60004954","affilname":"National Institute of Technology Karnataka","affiliation-city":"Mangalore","affiliation-country":"India"}],"pubmed-id":"30096632","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"re","subtypeDescription":"Review","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203243471","authid":"57203243471","authname":"Roy S.","surname":"Roy","given-name":"Santanu","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004954"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203247424","authid":"57203247424","authname":"kumar Jain A.","surname":"kumar Jain","given-name":"Alok","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004954"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35737283800","authid":"35737283800","authname":"Lal S.","surname":"Lal","given-name":"Shyam","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004954"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602229798","authid":"6602229798","authname":"Kini J.","surname":"Kini","given-name":"Jyoti","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016017"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color variation | Histopathology images | Quality metrics | Spectral normalization","source-id":"110086","fund-acr":"SERB","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Science and Engineering Research Board","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059101027"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059101027?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059101027&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059101027&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059101027","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85059101027","eid":"2-s2.0-85059101027","dc:title":"Polarization feature extraction using quaternion neural networks for flexible unsupervised polsar land classification","dc:creator":"Kim H.","prism:publicationName":"International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538671504"}],"prism:volume":"2018-July","prism:pageRange":"2378-2381","prism:coverDate":"2018-10-31","prism:coverDisplayDate":"31 October 2018","prism:doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8519363","dc:description":"We propose an unsupervised PolSAR land classification system consisting of quaternion auto-encoder and quaternion self-organizing map (SOM).

The simulation results exhibit the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed controller.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010726","afid":"60010726","affilname":"Doshisha University","affiliation-city":"Kyoto","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7409417392","authid":"7409417392","authname":"Takahashi K.","surname":"Takahashi","given-name":"Kazuhiko","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010726"}]}],"article-number":"8502547","source-id":"21100275520","fund-acr":"MEXT","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85056497015"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85056497015?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85056497015&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85056497015&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85056497015","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85056497015","eid":"2-s2.0-85056497015","dc:title":"Four-Directional Total Variation Denoising Using Fast Fourier Transform and ADMM","dc:creator":"Cheng Z.","prism:publicationName":"2018 3rd IEEE International Conference on Image, Vision and Computing, ICIVC 2018","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538649916"}],"prism:pageRange":"379-383","prism:coverDate":"2018-10-15","prism:coverDisplayDate":"15 October 2018","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICIVC.2018.8492869","dc:description":"Noise removal is a fundamental problem in image processing. Among many approaches, the total variation has attracted great attention because of its nice mathematical interpretation. Traditional total variation explores the gradient information of the vertical and the horizontal directions. Thus, the number of directions can be increased to further improve denoising performance. The resulting challenge is higher computation since multiple constraints are introduced in denoising model. This work first transforms the quaternion total variation constraints problem in the spatial domain into a problem in the frequency domain by using the fast Fourier transform and the convolution theorem. Then, it incorporates the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to enable fast image denoising. This fast computation is verified by the comparisons with other total variation based methods including state-of-the-art methods.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60092440","afid":"60092440","affilname":"Minnan Normal University","affiliation-city":"Zhangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/118617916","afid":"118617916","affilname":"Zhangzhou Branch of Fujian Electric Power Supply Company of State Grid","affiliation-city":null,"affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194462767","authid":"57194462767","authname":"Cheng Z.","surname":"Cheng","given-name":"Zhuyuan","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"118617916"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54412022800","authid":"54412022800","authname":"Chen Y.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Yuqun","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60092440"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211488549","authid":"57211488549","authname":"Wang L.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Lingzhi","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60092440"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204641498","authid":"57204641498","authname":"Lin F.","surname":"Lin","given-name":"Fan","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60092440"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204650197","authid":"57204650197","authname":"Wang H.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Haiguang","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"118617916"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55558023400","authid":"55558023400","authname":"Chen Y.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Yingpin","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"118617916"}]}],"authkeywords":"ADMM | Fast Fourier transform | Image denoising | Inverse problem | Total variation","article-number":"8492869","source-id":"21100885802","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"JAT170352","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054721988"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054721988?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85054721988&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85054721988&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054721988","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85054721988","eid":"2-s2.0-85054721988","dc:title":"Infrared image super-resolution reconstruction based on quaternion fractional order total variation with L<inf>p</inf> quasinorm","dc:creator":"Liu X.","prism:publicationName":"Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","prism:eIssn":"20763417","prism:volume":"8","prism:issueIdentifier":"10","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2018-10-10","prism:coverDisplayDate":"10 October 2018","prism:doi":"10.3390/app8101864","dc:description":"Owing to the limitations of the imaging principle as well as the properties of imaging systems, infrared images often have some drawbacks, including low resolution, a lack of detail, and indistinct edges.

Our proposed method improves the sparsity exploitation of FTV, and efficiently preserves image structures. Furthermore, we adopt the plug-and-play alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) theory for the proposed method to improve the efficiency and robustness of our algorithm; in addition, an accelerated step is adopted.

The succeeding operations are directly applied to two-dimensional quaternion matrices, and hence QSDA is computationally efficient and well preserves the spatial structure of color face images.

In this article, a color image splicing detection approach is proposed based on Markov transition probability of quaternion component separation in quaternion discrete cosine transform (QDCT) domain and quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) domain. First, Markov features of the intra-block and inter-block between block QDCT coefficients are obtained from the real parts and three imaginary parts of QDCT coefficients, respectively. Then, additional Markov features are extracted from the luminance (Y) channel in the quaternion wavelet transform domain to characterize the dependency of position among quaternion wavelet sub-band coefficients. Finally, an ensemble classifier (EC) is exploited to classify the spliced and authentic color images. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach can outperform some state-of-the-art methods.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60273040","afid":"60273040","affilname":"Institute of Information Engineering","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143","afid":"60064143","affilname":"Nanjing University of Information Science &amp; Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021182","afid":"60021182","affilname":"Sun Yat-Sen University","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017456","afid":"60017456","affilname":"Jinan University","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202368398","authid":"57202368398","authname":"Wang R.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Ruxin","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021182"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57715097700","authid":"57715097700","authname":"Lu W.","surname":"Lu","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021182"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202462417","authid":"57202462417","authname":"Li J.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Jixian","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021182"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12804229800","authid":"12804229800","authname":"Xiang S.","surname":"Xiang","given-name":"Shijun","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017456"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55623697900","authid":"55623697900","authname":"Zhao X.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Xianfeng","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60273040"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219116697","authid":"57219116697","authname":"Wang J.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Jinwei","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]}],"authkeywords":"Ensemble classifier | Image splicing detection | Markov features | Quaternion discrete cosine transform | Quaternion wavelet transform","source-id":"19700186847","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85060096669"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85060096669?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85060096669&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85060096669&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85060096669","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85060096669","eid":"2-s2.0-85060096669","dc:title":"Research on a vehicle status based measurement equation for yaw estimation","dc:creator":"Shi G.","prism:publicationName":"Yi Qi Yi Biao Xue Bao/Chinese Journal of Scientific Instrument","prism:issn":"02543087","prism:volume":"39","prism:issueIdentifier":"10","prism:pageRange":"176-183","prism:coverDate":"2018-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2018","prism:doi":"10.19650/j.cnki.cjsi.J1803842","dc:description":"An adaptive Kalman filter algorithm that uses unit quaternion as state vector fuses the signals from triaxis gyroscope, triaxis accelerometer and triaxis magnetic sensor to realize vehicle yaw estimation. In magnetically disturbed environment, the algorithm adjusts the weight of the magnetic sensor measurement in yaw estimation according to the magnetic disturbance intensity so that the estimation error caused by magnetic disturbance is reduced. However, this method will make the yaw prediction to lose effective constraint. To address this problem, a new measurement equation based on the vehicle status is studied. Firstly, the measurement equation is derived according to the relationship between the unit quaternion and yaw. Secondly, according to the correlations among the output signals of different sensors the vehicle status is determined and the adaptive adjustment of measurement weight coefficients is realized. At last, the new measurement equation is incorporated into the yaw estimation fusion algorithm. In experiments, the fusion algorithms with and without incorporating the new measurement equation were used to process the real sensor data, and the experiment results show that the new measurement equation can perform the constraint action for the yaw prediction when magnetic disturbance occurs; therefore, the new measurement equation improves the anti-disturbance ability of the yaw estimation algorithm effectively.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60105111","afid":"60105111","affilname":"China University of Petroleum (East China)","affiliation-city":"Qingdao","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018273","afid":"60018273","affilname":"University of Science and Technology Beijing","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194397968","authid":"57194397968","authname":"Shi G.","surname":"Shi","given-name":"Gang","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018273"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60105111"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60105111"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14056258400","authid":"14056258400","authname":"Li X.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Xisheng","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018273"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018273"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203128053","authid":"57203128053","authname":"Bai Y.","surname":"Bai","given-name":"Yanru","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018273"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018273"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190816205","authid":"57190816205","authname":"Zheng C.","surname":"Zheng","given-name":"Chengcai","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018273"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35185584500","authid":"35185584500","authname":"Shu X.","surname":"Shu","given-name":"Xiongying","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018273"}]}],"authkeywords":"Accelerometer | Gyroscope | Kalman filter | Magnetic sensor | Quaternion | Yaw estimation","source-id":"15597","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85056104875"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85056104875?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85056104875&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85056104875&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85056104875","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85056104875","eid":"2-s2.0-85056104875","dc:title":"Saliency-based visualization of hyperspectral satellite images using hierarchical fusion","dc:creator":"Masood F.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Applied Remote Sensing","prism:eIssn":"19313195","prism:volume":"12","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2018-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2018","prism:doi":"10.1117/1.JRS.12.046011","dc:description":"Owing to a large number of spectral bands, it is always a challenge to devise an optimal visualization method for hyperspectral images.

Quaternion is used to represent differences of two pixels. The pixels are sorted and assigned a rank based on the aggregated sum of pixel differences with other pixels inside the filtering window. The central pixel is considered as corrupted by an impulse if its rank is bigger than a predefined rank and the minimum difference between it and other pixels in the four edge direction inside the window is larger than a predefined threshold. The noisy pixel is replaced by output of vector median filter implemented using quaternion. For color images, both intensity and chromaticity components are used. Quaternion processes color images as single unit rather than as separated color channels. This preserves the correlation and three dimensional vector natures of the color channels. For grayscale medical images, the same algorithm is implemented by using the intensity difference between two pixels.

Keypoint based CMFD approaches extract image interest points and use local visual features to identify duplicated regions, which exhibit remarkable performance with respect to memory requirement and computational cost. But unfortunately, they usually use the pure gray-based detectors to extract interest points in which the significant color information is ignored. Also, local visual features are computed without considering the correlation between different color channels. All this lower inevitably the detection and localization accuracy for color tampered image. In this paper we propose a new technique for the detection and localization of copy-move forgeries, which is based on color invariance model and quaternion polar complex exponential transform (QPCET). First, stable color image interest points are extracted by using new interest point detector, in which the SURF (speeded up robust features) detector and color invariance model are incorporated. Then, a set of connected Delaunay triangles is built based on the extracted color image interest points, and suitable local visual features of the triangle mesh are computed using QPCET. Afterwards, local visual features are employed to match triangular meshes by a combination of reversed-generalized 2 nearest-neighbor (Rg2NN) and best bin first (BBF). Finally, the falsely matched triangular meshes are removed by customizing the random sample consensus, and the duplicated regions are localized using zero mean normalized cross-correlation measure. Compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, extensive experimental results prove that our proposed method can detect and localize color image copy-moves with good accuracy even in adverse conditions.","citedby-count":"27","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017010","afid":"60017010","affilname":"Liaoning Normal University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004538","afid":"60004538","affilname":"Dalian University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972239800","authid":"34972239800","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiang Yang","initials":"X.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195237384","authid":"57195237384","authname":"Jiao L.","surname":"Jiao","given-name":"Li Xian","initials":"L.X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201188158","authid":"57201188158","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xue Bing","initials":"X.B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972350300","authid":"34972350300","authname":"Yang H.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Hong Ying","initials":"H.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16205443400","authid":"16205443400","authname":"Niu P.","surname":"Niu","given-name":"Pan Pan","initials":"P.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color invariance model | Copy-move forgery detection | Delaunay triangles | Quaternion polar complex exponential transform | Reversed generalized 2 nearest-neighbor","source-id":"23674","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61272416","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85052675193"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85052675193?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85052675193&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85052675193&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85052675193","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85052675193","eid":"2-s2.0-85052675193","dc:title":"Robust color image watermarking using invariant quaternion Legendre-Fourier moments","dc:creator":"Hosny K.M.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","prism:issn":"13807501","prism:eIssn":"15737721","prism:volume":"77","prism:issueIdentifier":"19","prism:pageRange":"24727-24750","prism:coverDate":"2018-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2018","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11042-018-5670-9","dc:description":"In this paper, a geometrically invariant color image watermarking method using Quaternion Legendre-Fourier moments (QLFMs) is presented. A highly accurate, fast and numerically stable method is proposed to compute the QLFMs in polar coordinates. The proposed watermarking method consists of three main steps. First, the Arnold scrambling algorithm is applied to a binary watermark image. Second, the QLFMs of the original host color image are computed. Third, the binary digital watermark is embedding by performing the quantization of selected QLFMs. Two different groups of attacks are considered. The first group includes geometric attacks such as rotation, scaling and translation while the second group includes the common signal processing attacks such as image compression and noise. Experiments are performed where the performance of proposed method is compared with the existing moment-based watermarking methods. The proposed method is superior over all existing quaternion moment-based watermarking in terms of visual imperceptibility capability and robustness to different attacks.","citedby-count":"60","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60274165","afid":"60274165","affilname":"Faculty of Computers and Information","affiliation-city":"Zagazig","affiliation-country":"Egypt"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60273131","afid":"60273131","affilname":"Faculty of Science","affiliation-city":"Asyut","affiliation-country":"Egypt"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205214086","authid":"57205214086","authname":"Hosny K.M.","surname":"Hosny","given-name":"Khalid M.","initials":"K.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60274165"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205229124","authid":"57205229124","authname":"Darwish M.M.","surname":"Darwish","given-name":"Mohamed M.","initials":"M.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60273131"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image watermarking | Geometric attacks | Quaternion Legendre-Fourier moments | Rotation invariant","source-id":"25627","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050114499"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050114499?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85050114499&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85050114499&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0094576518304739"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050114499","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85050114499","eid":"2-s2.0-85050114499","dc:title":"A passive camera based determination of a non-cooperative and unknown satellite's pose and shape","dc:creator":"Volpe R.","prism:publicationName":"Acta Astronautica","prism:issn":"00945765","prism:volume":"151","prism:pageRange":"805-817","prism:coverDate":"2018-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"October 2018","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.06.061","pii":"S0094576518304739","dc:description":"The relevance of autonomy in space systems during rendezvous and docking operations has been lately increasing. At the scope, a robust GNC architecture is required, which strictly relies on the navigation system's performance and must assure both high efficiency and safety, i.e. low errors and no collisions with the target satellite. One of the most explored fields is the optical navigation one. Using passive optical sensors such as cameras can give high benefit in terms of characterization of the observed scene, thus enlarging the consciousness of what is going on in the mission scenario. The present research investigates the development of a filter which can estimate the shape and relative attitude, position and velocity of a non-cooperative, possibly unknown satellite orbiting around Earth, observed by a camera and a distance sensor mounted on a chaser satellite, whose objective is to successfully complete a docking maneuver. The image taken at a certain time is processed, features are extracted from it and matched with the ones extracted from the image at the previous time step. The matched features along with the relative distance measured by the distance sensor are merged inside an unscented Kalman filter, which predicts, updates and improves the state's estimate throughout the iterations. The expedient used in the filter is to give a 3D characterization to the 2D features used as measurements. The filter estimates the 3D coordinates of these points, i.e. the target's shape, in the camera reference frame, which depend on the target's attitude dynamics and the chaser's relative orbital dynamics. Thus, the target's attitude parameters, i.e. the quaternions, and angular velocity vector, the relative position and velocity vectors and the tracked 3D points are all included in the state vector and estimated by the filter. Subsequently, the 3D point coordinates are determined in the body reference frame. By doing this for all the tracked points, a 3D map of the target can be built.","citedby-count":"20","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032350","afid":"60032350","affilname":"Sapienza Università di Roma","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194609421","authid":"57194609421","orcid":"0000-0002-1423-1673","authname":"Volpe R.","surname":"Volpe","given-name":"Renato","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603132122","authid":"6603132122","orcid":"0000-0001-8976-8750","authname":"Palmerini G.B.","surname":"Palmerini","given-name":"Giovanni B.","initials":"G.B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35782355500","authid":"35782355500","orcid":"0000-0002-2403-848X","authname":"Sabatini M.","surname":"Sabatini","given-name":"Marco","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]}],"source-id":"12372","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049300097"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049300097?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85049300097&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85049300097&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049300097","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85049300097","eid":"2-s2.0-85049300097","dc:title":"The kinematic image of RR, PR, and RP dyads","dc:creator":"Rad T.","prism:publicationName":"Robotica","prism:issn":"02635747","prism:eIssn":"14698668","prism:volume":"36","prism:issueIdentifier":"10","prism:pageRange":"1477-1492","prism:coverDate":"2018-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2018","prism:doi":"10.1017/S0263574718000504","dc:description":"We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for all projective transformations of the projectivized dual quaternion model of rigid body displacements that are induced by coordinate changes in moving and/or fixed frame. These transformations fix the quadrics of a pencil and preserve the two families of rulings of an exceptional three-dimensional quadric. Moreover, we fully characterize the constraint varieties of dyads with revolute and prismatic joints in the dual quaternion model. The constraint variety of a dyad with two revolute joints is a regular ruled quadric in a three-space that contains a null quadrilateral. If a revolute joint is replaced by a prismatic joint, this quadrilateral collapses into a pair of conjugate complex null lines and a real line but these properties are not sufficient to characterize such dyads. We provide a complete characterization by introducing a new invariant, the Study fibre projectivity, and we present examples that demonstrate its potential to explain hitherto not sufficiently well-understood phenomena.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009999","afid":"60009999","affilname":"Universität Innsbruck","affiliation-city":"Innsbruck","affiliation-country":"Austria"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195222066","authid":"57195222066","authname":"Rad T.","surname":"Rad","given-name":"Tudor Dan","initials":"T.D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009999"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202781131","authid":"57202781131","authname":"Scharler D.","surname":"Scharler","given-name":"Daniel F.","initials":"D.F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009999"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8839967500","authid":"8839967500","authname":"Schröcker H.","surname":"Schröcker","given-name":"Hans Peter","initials":"H.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009999"}]}],"authkeywords":"Dual quaternion | Kinematic map | Null cone | Prismatic joint | Revolute joint | Study fibre projectivity | Study quadric | Vertical Darboux motion","source-id":"18078","fund-acr":"FWF","fund-no":"P 26607","fund-sponsor":"Austrian Science Fund","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}}]}}
