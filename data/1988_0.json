The approach consists of representing the constant acceleration translational motion and constant angular velocity or constant precession rotational motion in the form of a bilinear state-space model using standard rectilinear states for translation and quaternions for rotation. Closed-form solutions of state transition equations are obtained to propagate the quaternions in both constant-angular-velocity and constant-precession models. The measurements are noisy perturbations of 3-D feature points represented in an inertial coordiate system. It is assumed that the structure is known and that 3-D feature points are extracted from the stereo images and matched over the frames. Owing to the nonlinearity in the state model, nonlinear filters are designed for the estimation of motion parameters. Simulation results are included.","citedby-count":"24","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029311","afid":"60029311","affilname":"University of Southern California","affiliation-city":"Los Angeles","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402900380","authid":"7402900380","authname":"Young G.S.","surname":"Young","given-name":"Gem Sun","initials":"G.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029311"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203078416","authid":"57203078416","authname":"Chellappa R.","surname":"Chellappa","given-name":"Rama","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029311"}]}],"source-id":"133351","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0023786671"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0023786671?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0023786671&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0023786671&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0023786671","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0023786671","eid":"2-s2.0-0023786671","dc:title":"Connection between internal representation of rigid transformation and cortical activity paths","dc:creator":"Carlton E.H.","prism:publicationName":"Biological Cybernetics","prism:issn":"03401200","prism:eIssn":"14320770","prism:volume":"59","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"419-429","prism:coverDate":"1988-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"October 1988","prism:doi":"10.1007/BF00336115","dc:description":"A canonical unitary representation of the Euclidean group on the range space of the Gabor transform is constructed from mathematical properties of the Euclidean group and the quaternions.

The nonlinear aerodynamic model has been identified by applying the estimation-before-modeling (EBM) technique to flight data derived from 15 maneuvers including 7 stalls and âpoststall gyrations.â An extended Kalman-Bucy filter and a modified Bryson-Frazier smoother were used to estimate the time histories of the forces and moments from a 14 element discrete measurement vector. The optimal estimates and the measured control variables were sorted into 50 âsubspaces,â and the aerodynamic modeling was performed using a multiple regression scheme in each subspace. The linear and nonlinear portions of the coefficients could be observed from the modeling results, providing insight into the stall dynamic behavior of the sailplane. The accuracy of the aerodynamic coefficients was assessed by comparing measured time histories of the sailplane with a six-degree-of-freedom simulation model response. A novel aspect of the research is the use of a quaternion-based mathematical model of aircraft dynamics. A microprocessor-based data acquisition system was used onboard the sailplane.
