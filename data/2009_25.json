The representation method is different from conventional models in that some information that is sensitive to human eyes is reinforced by using local variance. It encodes the local variance distribution of the RGB channels of a color image into the three imaginary parts of a quaternion. The luminance layer of the color image is taken as the real part of the quaternion. The distance between the singular value feature vectors of the source image block and the distorted image block which are described by quaternion matrices is calculated. The final assessment result is calculated by using the mid point of the distances.

Unlike conventional 2-feature parallel fusion with complex representation, it is tough to represent 4-feature parallel fusion due to shortage of mathematical significance. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a reasonable interpretation by introducing quaternion. Initially, this paper defines a novel ROI extraction method for obtaining more information from middle finger images. After parallel fusion whose features are extracted by 2D wavelets decomposition coefficients from the same pixel corresponding to 4 separate sub-images, Quaternion Euclidean Product Distance (QEPD), a distance between modulus square of template quaternion and modulus of tester Quaternion Euclidean Product (QEP), as matching score, is performed. The scores discriminate between genuine and impostor of finger texture by threshold effectively. Finally, the experimental result gains a reasonable recognition rate but at a fast speed. Through a comparison with palmprint QEPD, the recognition performance of this finger texture QEPD outperforms than palmprint. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022381","afid":"60022381","affilname":"Beijing Jiaotong University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202593365","authid":"57202593365","authname":"Qiu D.","surname":"Qiu","given-name":"Di Liu Zheng Ding","initials":"D.L.Z.D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022381"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13607460000","authid":"13607460000","authname":"Sun D.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Dong Mei","initials":"D.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022381"}]}],"source-id":"17700155007","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70449602543"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70449602543?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=70449602543&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=70449602543&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70449602543","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:70449602543","eid":"2-s2.0-70449602543","dc:title":"Long-term vehicle motion prediction","dc:creator":"Hermes C.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium, Proceedings","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781424435043"}],"prism:pageRange":"652-657","prism:coverDate":"2009-11-20","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2009","prism:doi":"10.1109/IVS.2009.5164354","dc:description":"Future driver assistance systems will have to cope with complex traffic situations, especially in the road crossing scenario. To detect potentially hazardous situations as early as possible, it is therefore desirable to know the position and motion of the ego-vehicle and vehicles around it for several seconds in advance. For this purpose, we propose in this study a long-term prediction approach based on a combined trajectory classification and particle filter framework. As a measure for the similarity between trajectories, we introduce the quaternion-based rotationally invariant longest common subsequence (QRLCS) metric. The trajectories are classified by a radial basis function (RBF) classifier with an architecture that is able to process trajectories of arbitrary non-uniform length. The particle filter framework simultaneously tracks and assesses a large number of motion hypotheses (∼102), where the class-specific probabilities estimated by the RBF classifier are used as a-priori probabilities for the hypotheses of the particle filter. The hypotheses are clustered with a mean-shift technique and are assigned a likelihood value. Motion prediction is performed based on the cluster centre with the highest likelihood. While traditional motion prediction based on curve radius and acceleration is inaccurate especially during turning manoeuvres, we show that our approach achieves a reasonable motion prediction even for long prediction intervals of 3 s for these complex motion patterns. © 2009 IEEE.","citedby-count":"129","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60085149","afid":"60085149","affilname":"Daimler AG","affiliation-city":"Stuttgart","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015595","afid":"60015595","affilname":"Universität Bielefeld","affiliation-city":"Bielefeld","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36727971400","authid":"36727971400","authname":"Hermes C.","surname":"Hermes","given-name":"Christoph","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015595"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701786659","authid":"6701786659","authname":"Wohler C.","surname":"Wohler","given-name":"Christian","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60085149"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35192301700","authid":"35192301700","authname":"Schenk K.","surname":"Schenk","given-name":"Konrad","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60085149"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602460088","authid":"6602460088","authname":"Kummert F.","surname":"Kummert","given-name":"Franz","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015595"}]}],"article-number":"5164354","source-id":"70642","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70449564757"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70449564757?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=70449564757&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=70449564757&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70449564757","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:70449564757","eid":"2-s2.0-70449564757","dc:title":"A novel attitude and motion determination algorithm based on dual quaternion","dc:creator":"Kao C.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the Institute of Navigation, National Technical Meeting","prism:volume":"2","prism:pageRange":"635-641","prism:coverDate":"2009-11-20","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2009","dc:description":"In this paper, we present a dual-quaternion approach to solve the problem of (simultaneously) three-dimensional (3-D) attitude, position and relative motion determination by using two-dimensional (2-D) intensity image measurement.

A solution to this problem that uses two-dimensional, intensity images from a single camera is desirable for real-time applications. A single camera is advantageous because a standard video camera is low in cost, setup and calibration are simple, physical space requirements are small, reliability is high, and low-cost hardware is available for digitizing and processing the images. In this paper, solutions to the remote measurement (using a single camera) problem for a dynamic system given a sequence of 2-D intensity images of an object are provided for both of the cases where feature positions of the object are known relative to a base reference frame and where feature positions are unknown relative to a base reference frame.

The BEMD is a locally adaptive method and suitable for the analysis of nonlinear or nonstationary signals. The texture image is decomposed to several 2D-IMFs (two dimentional intrinsic mode functions) by BEMD (Bidimentional Empirical Mode Decomposition). Then quaternion is used to get the quaternionic analytic signals, which is compatible with the associated harmonic transform. Finally, each 2D-IMF's local properties are analyzed by using a new quaternionic representation. As an advanced method for describing the local properties of a 2D-signal, this algorithm has seven characters of each 2D-IMF including instantaneous frequency. The performance of this texture analysis method is demonstrated with both synthetic and natural images. © 2009 IEEE.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014966","afid":"60014966","affilname":"Peking University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002786","afid":"60002786","affilname":"Hebei Normal University","affiliation-city":"Shijiazhuang","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36919115400","authid":"36919115400","authname":"Qiao L.H.","surname":"Qiao","given-name":"Li Hong","initials":"L.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002786"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57088423000","authid":"57088423000","authname":"Guo W.","surname":"Guo","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014966"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/21234567100","authid":"21234567100","authname":"Yuan W.T.","surname":"Yuan","given-name":"Wei Tao","initials":"W.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014966"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35146427800","authid":"35146427800","authname":"Niu K.F.","surname":"Niu","given-name":"Kai Fu","initials":"K.F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014966"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201574096","authid":"7201574096","authname":"Peng L.Z.","surname":"Peng","given-name":"Li Zhong","initials":"L.Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014966"}]}],"authkeywords":"Bidimensional empirical mode decomposition | Hilbert-Huang transform | Quaternionic analytic signal | Texture analysis","article-number":"5207477","source-id":"19400158354","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70350616331"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70350616331?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=70350616331&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=70350616331&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70350616331","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:70350616331","eid":"2-s2.0-70350616331","dc:title":"Complex diffusion on scalar and vector valued image graphs","dc:creator":"Seo D.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"3642036406"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783642036408"}],"prism:volume":"5681 LNCS","prism:pageRange":"98-111","prism:coverDate":"2009-11-06","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2009","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-03641-5_8","dc:description":"Complex diffusion was introduced in the image processing literature as a means to achieve simultaneous denoising and enhancement of scalar valued images. In this paper, we present a novel geometric framework to achieve complex diffusion for color images represented by image graphs. In this framework, we develop a novel variational formulation that involves a modified harmonic map functional and is quite distinct from the Polyakov action described by Sochen et al. Our formulation provides a novel framework for simultaneous feature preserving denoising and enhancement. We also develop a quaternionic diffusion that can be applied to color image data represented by a quaternion in the image graph framework. In this framework, the real and imaginary parts can be interpreted as low and high-pass filtered data respectively. Finally, we suggest novel ways to use the imaginary part of complex diffusion toward image reconstruction.

Orientation learning is a difficult problem because the space of orientations is non-Euclidean, and in some cases (such as quaternions) the representation is ambiguous, in that multiple representations exist for the same physical orientation. Learning is further complicated by the fact that most man-made objects exhibit symmetry, so that there are multiple \"correct\" orientations. In this paper, we propose a new representation for orientations-and a class of learning and inference algorithms using this representation- that allows us to learn orientations for symmetric or asymmetric objects as a function of a single image.

This method, which applies hyper-complex numbers (hypernions), was first developed by the authors for analyzing the non-sinusoidal operation of electrical circuits. Now, the method has been extended to the analysis of electronic/switching circuits in which the sources and/or the parameters are step-wisely changed as a result of switching. Such circuits are common in different kinds of DC-DC converters (such as Buck, Boost, Cuk, etc.). The proposed method gives a new approach to the analysis of the above circuits by opening the possibility of treating them in a general-analytical form, just like in regular electrical circuits having a constant configuration and constant parameters. The computation of such kinds of circuits by using the proposed method becomes very simple, since the circuit does not have to be analyzed many times, each time for a different configuration, but all at once by performing a parallel computation. The theoretical presentation is accompanied by numerical examples. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Company.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60103954","afid":"60103954","affilname":"Sami Shamoon College of Engineering","affiliation-city":"Ashdod","affiliation-country":"Israel"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016941","afid":"60016941","affilname":"Holon Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Holon","affiliation-country":"Israel"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56271175800","authid":"56271175800","authname":"Berkovich Y.","surname":"Berkovich","given-name":"Yefim","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016941"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56627687900","authid":"56627687900","authname":"Shenkman A.","surname":"Shenkman","given-name":"Arieh","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016941"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24922085100","authid":"24922085100","authname":"Tapuchi S.","surname":"Tapuchi","given-name":"Saad","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60103954"}]}],"authkeywords":"Circuits with changing topology | Electrical circuits | Hyper-complex numbers | Matrices | Non-sinusoidal signals","source-id":"26046","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70350244987"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70350244987?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=70350244987&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=70350244987&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70350244987","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:70350244987","eid":"2-s2.0-70350244987","dc:title":"Face recognition using local quaternion patters and weighted spatially constrained earth mover's distance","dc:creator":"Zhou W.","prism:publicationName":"Digest of Technical Papers - IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics","prism:issn":"0747668X","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781424429769"}],"prism:pageRange":"285-289","prism:coverDate":"2009-10-27","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2009","prism:doi":"10.1109/ISCE.2009.5156971","dc:description":"This paper presents a novel algorithm for face recognition. Local Quaternion Patters (LQP) is proposed for presenting the feature parts in the face. To keep the spatial feature of the face, an asymmetric similarity measure Weighted Spatially constrained Earth Mover's Distance (WSEMD) is studied for classification. In this step, the source image is partitioned into non overlapping local patches while the destination image is represented as a set of overlapping local patches at different positions and Gaussian Kernel is used. Finally, local and global weighting is applied to get a more accurate classifier. To evaluate the proposed method and its performance, three well-known and challenge face databases - ORL, Yale and FERET are used in our study.

It is based on the Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) tree technique developed by Pei and Cheng and the multiphase level-set framework developed by T. Chan and L. Vese. We present a new variational formulation for geometric contours that divides the image region in a binary fashion using binary quaternion moment preserving thresholding technique and therefore completely eliminates the need of the costly re-initialization and calculation of number of regions procedure. The sum of square error value determines the required homogeneity of the color in the region and inturn decides the number of regions in the image. Our variational formulation consists of an internal energy term that penalizes the deviation of the level set function from a signed distance function and quaternion moment based external energy term that drives the motion of the zero level set rapidly and discontinuously toward the color boundaries in an image. The resulting evolution of the level set function is the gradient flow that minimizes the overall energy functional. The proposed algorithm has been applied to both synthetic and natural color images with promising results. © Medwell Journals, 2009.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60100981","afid":"60100981","affilname":"J J College of Engineering and Technology","affiliation-city":"Tiruchirappalli","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000965","afid":"60000965","affilname":"Government College of Technology, Coimbatore","affiliation-city":"Coimbatore","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23986383100","authid":"23986383100","authname":"Sujaritha M.","surname":"Sujaritha","given-name":"M.","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60100981"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15134770300","authid":"15134770300","authname":"Annadurai S.","surname":"Annadurai","given-name":"S.","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000965"}]}],"authkeywords":"Binary space partitioning tree | Color | Energy minimization | Level sets | Segmentation","source-id":"17200154704","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/72449128596"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/72449128596?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=72449128596&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=72449128596&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/72449128596","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:72449128596","eid":"2-s2.0-72449128596","dc:title":"Rock fracture edge detection based on quaternion convolution using average weighting","dc:creator":"Xu J.","prism:publicationName":"Guangdian Gongcheng/Opto-Electronic Engineering","prism:issn":"1003501X","prism:volume":"36","prism:issueIdentifier":"10","prism:pageRange":"76-80","prism:coverDate":"2009-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"October 2009","prism:doi":"10.3969/j.issn.1003-501X.2009.10.015","dc:description":"Rock fractures have a strong impact on the radionuclide transport and retention.

Applied to the white, the attenuation gives a hue vector caracterizing the water color. Using this reference axis, geometrical transformations into the color space are computed with quaternions. Pixels of water areas of processed images are moved to gray or colors with a low saturation whereas the objects remain fully colored. Thus, the contrast of the observed scene is significantly improved and the difference between the background and the rest of the image is increased, giving a first approach towards a presegmentation step. ©2009 IEEE.","citedby-count":"58","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032653","afid":"60032653","affilname":"Universite de Poitiers","affiliation-city":"Poitiers","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35076439000","authid":"35076439000","authname":"Petit F.","surname":"Petit","given-name":"Frédéric","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032653"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701428228","authid":"6701428228","authname":"Capelle-Laizé A.S.","surname":"Capelle-Laizé","given-name":"Anne Sophie","initials":"A.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032653"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36008284700","authid":"36008284700","authname":"Carré P.","surname":"Carré","given-name":"Philippe","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032653"}]}],"authkeywords":"Colorimetry | Images enhancement | Quaternions | Underwater images","article-number":"4959799","source-id":"110544","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70349223942"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70349223942?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=70349223942&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=70349223942&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70349223942","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:70349223942","eid":"2-s2.0-70349223942","dc:title":"Qualitative analysis of rotational modes within three dimensional empirical mode decomposition","dc:creator":"Ur Rehman N.","prism:publicationName":"ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - Proceedings","prism:issn":"15206149","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781424423545"}],"prism:pageRange":"3449-3452","prism:coverDate":"2009-09-23","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2009","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960367","dc:description":"An analysis of quaternion-valued intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) within three dimensional empirical mode decomposition is presented.

A number of rock specimens were sampled, and then the rock images were acquired for detecting the fracture edges. Edge detection in color images could be seen as detecting changes in a vector field. The quaternion convolution at different scales is applied. In addition, to suppress image noise, the dot product was computed at adjacent scales. At the same time, the gray-level difference was applied to obtain the monochromatic edges. To merge the merits of the quaternion convolution and the gray-level difference, the two results are combined. In this way, the thinned edges can be obtained by using modulus maximum suppression. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient and robust for rock fracture edge detection. © 2009 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018540","afid":"60018540","affilname":"Southwestern University of Finance and Economics","affiliation-city":"Chengdu","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005465","afid":"60005465","affilname":"University of Electronic Science and Technology of China","affiliation-city":"Chengdu","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23494309200","authid":"23494309200","authname":"Xu J.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Jiangyan","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7501756835","authid":"7501756835","authname":"Wang W.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Weixing","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/18234344600","authid":"18234344600","authname":"Ye L.","surname":"Ye","given-name":"Linning","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018540"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image | Dot product | Edge detection | Quaternion convolution | Rock fracture","article-number":"097001","source-id":"12316","fund-acr":"NWMO","fund-no":"60873186/F020509","fund-sponsor":"Nuclear Waste Management Organization","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70349213307"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70349213307?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=70349213307&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=70349213307&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70349213307","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:70349213307","eid":"2-s2.0-70349213307","dc:title":"Study of the quaternion LMS and four-channel LMS algorithms","dc:creator":"Took C.C.","prism:publicationName":"ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - Proceedings","prism:issn":"15206149","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781424423545"}],"prism:pageRange":"3109-3112","prism:coverDate":"2009-09-23","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2009","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960282","dc:description":"The recently proposed quaternion least-mean-square (QLMS) algorithm for adaptive filtering of three- and four-dimensional signals has been analysed in the context of multi-step ahead prediction.
