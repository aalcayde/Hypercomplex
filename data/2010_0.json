Local variance of the luminance layer of the color image is taken as the real part of a quaternion, then the three RGB channels of the color image are encoded into the three imaginary parts of a quaternion. The angle between the singular value feature vectors of the quaternion matrices corresponding to one of the source image and the fused image is used to measure their structural similarity. Edge information transferring is used to balance the sensitivity of the assessment methods. Experimental results show that the proposed assessment method is better consistent with the HVS than some of the state-of-the-art method.

Belonging to the class of Monte Carlo sequential methods, the filter uses the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to generate importance proposal distribution. It can not only avoid the limitation of the UKF which can only apply to Gaussian distribution, but also avoid the limitation of the standard PF which can not include the new measurements. A special procedure is developed to account for the curse of the dimensionality related to the PF in existence of augmented state vector. MRPs are used for attitude representations. The singularity problem associated with the MRPs is addressed as well using switching method. Simulation results demonstrate that the estimation algorithm has faster convergence rate and higher accuracy compared with the recently presented UKF, and it shows a reduction of about 10% in computational load compared with that using the quaternion estimation algorithm. © 2010 IEEE.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7409383638","authid":"7409383638","authname":"Yang Y.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Yafei","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36696653000","authid":"36696653000","authname":"Li J.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Jianguo","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude/angular rate estimation | Modified Rodrigues parameter | Particle filter | Star sensor","article-number":"5635597","source-id":"19700183053","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/78650425195"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/78650425195?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=78650425195&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=78650425195&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/78650425195","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:78650425195","eid":"2-s2.0-78650425195","dc:title":"Multichannel epileptic EEG classification using quaternions and neural network","dc:creator":"Zhao Y.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - 2010 1st International Conference on Pervasive Computing, Signal Processing and Applications, PCSPA 2010","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780769541808"}],"prism:pageRange":"568-571","prism:coverDate":"2010-12-28","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2010","prism:doi":"10.1109/PCSPA.2010.143","dc:description":"Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures.

Feature extraction is one of the principal steps on a face recognition framework, where it is possible to alleviate the illumination effects on face images. The aim of this work is to study the illumination invariant properties of a hypercomplex image representation. A quaternion description from the image is built using second order derivatives decomposition. This representation is transformed to quaternion frequency domain in order to analyze its illumination invariant and discriminative properties, which are compared against the ones of the complex frequency domain representation obtained by using first order derivative decomposition. The hypercomplex quaternion representation was found to be more discriminative than the complex one, when comparing on face recognition with images under varying lighting conditions. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60086400","afid":"60086400","affilname":"Centro de Aplicaciones de Tecnologías de Avanzada, Cuba","affiliation-city":"Havana","affiliation-country":"Cuba"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36622544700","authid":"36622544700","authname":"Rizo-Rodríguez D.","surname":"Rizo-Rodríguez","given-name":"Dayron","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60086400"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36622061300","authid":"36622061300","authname":"Méndez-Vázquez H.","surname":"Méndez-Vázquez","given-name":"Heydi","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60086400"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23472512800","authid":"23472512800","authname":"García-Reyes E.","surname":"García-Reyes","given-name":"Edel","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60086400"}]}],"source-id":"25674","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/78649538486"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/78649538486?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=78649538486&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=78649538486&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/78649538486","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:78649538486","eid":"2-s2.0-78649538486","dc:title":"The calibration for the optical probe of vision measurement system","dc:creator":"Xu Q.","prism:publicationName":"ICCASM 2010 - 2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling, Proceedings","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781424472369"}],"prism:volume":"15","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2010-12-06","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2010","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5622469","dc:description":"In order to reduce the impact of the coordinate precision of measuring tip in the optical probe coordinate system on the accuracy of vision measurement system based on optical probe, the paper presents the calibration method for the optical probe, which subjects to the constraint that the distance from the measuring tip to the origin of the optical probe coordinate system is constant. By minimizing the error of each measurement of the distance, the method calibrates the three-dimensional coordinates of the measuring tip in the optical probe coordinate system. During the process of calibrating, firstly, the coordinates of the feature points on the optical probe in the spatial coordinate system are obtained with the feature point images using the stereo vision reconstruction by minimizing the projection distance based on the common perpendicular constraint. Then, with these coordinates, the transformation between the optical probe coordinate system and the spatial coordinate system can be got using unit quaternion. Finally, based on the transformation, the measuring tip coordinate is calibrated by minimizing the estimated error of the distance from the measuring tip to the coordinate origin. Experiments show that the method can rapidly and effectively on-line calibrate the measuring tip, the calibration precision of xyz directions can reach 0.03mm, respectively, and the proposed method reduces the impact of the measuring tip coordinate on the vision measurement accuracy. © 2010 IEEE.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073587","afid":"60073587","affilname":"Henan University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Luoyang","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100430835","afid":"100430835","affilname":"Harbin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403743438","authid":"7403743438","authname":"Xu Q.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Qiaoyu","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073587"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36651903700","authid":"36651903700","authname":"Wang J.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Junwei","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"100430835"}]}],"authkeywords":"Calibration | Optical probe | Unit quaternion | Vision measurement system","article-number":"5622469","source-id":"19700182648","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84892256328"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84892256328?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84892256328&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84892256328&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84892256328","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84892256328","eid":"2-s2.0-84892256328","dc:title":"Geometric algebra computing: In engineering and computer science","dc:creator":"Bayro-Corrochano E.","prism:publicationName":"Geometric Algebra Computing: in Engineering and Computer Science","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781849961073"}],"prism:pageRange":"1-526","prism:coverDate":"2010-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2010","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-1-84996-108-0","dc:description":"Geometric algebra provides a rich and general mathematical framework for the development of solutions, concepts and computer algorithms without losing geometric insight into the problem in question.

Simulations have been carried out to verify the method and have shown that the error component of FOG output can be extracted efficiently by SSFES and the algorithm is easy to be performed by the onboard computers. © 2010 IEEE.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024350","afid":"60024350","affilname":"National University of Defense Technology China","affiliation-city":"Changsha","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14627665000","authid":"14627665000","authname":"Nie P.","surname":"Nie","given-name":"Peng Cheng","initials":"P.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403503934","authid":"7403503934","authname":"Yao J.","surname":"Yao","given-name":"Jing","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101808580","authid":"7101808580","authname":"Yi D.","surname":"Yi","given-name":"Dong Yun","initials":"D.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024350"}]}],"authkeywords":"Error Separation | Fiber Optical Gyroscope | Navigation System | Star Sensor","article-number":"5663616","source-id":"21100244931","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84876156989"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84876156989?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84876156989&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84876156989&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84876156989","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84876156989","eid":"2-s2.0-84876156989","dc:title":"QWT: Retrospective and new applications","dc:creator":"Xu Y.","prism:publicationName":"Geometric Algebra Computing: in Engineering and Computer Science","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781849961073"}],"prism:pageRange":"249-273","prism:coverDate":"2010-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2010","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-1-84996-108-0_13","dc:description":"Quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) achieves much attention in recent years as a new image analysis tool. In most cases, it is an extension of the real wavelet transform and complex wavelet transform (CWT) by using the quaternion algebra and the 2D Hilbert transform of filter theory, where analytic signal representation is desirable to retrieve phase-magnitude description of intrinsically 2D geometric structures in a grayscale image. In the context of color image processing, however, it is adapted to analyze the image pattern and color information as a whole unit by mapping sequential color pixels to a quaternion-valued vector signal. This paper provides a retrospective of QWT and investigates its potential use in the domain of image registration, image fusion, and color image recognition. It is indicated that it is important for QWT to induce the mechanism of adaptive scale representation of geometric features, which is further clarified through two application instances of uncalibrated stereo matching and optical flow estimation. Moreover, quaternionic phase congruency model is defined based on analytic signal representation so as to operate as an invariant feature detector for image registration. To achieve better localization of edges and textures in image fusion task, we incorporate directional filter bank (DFB) into the quaternion wavelet decomposition scheme to greatly enhance the direction selectivity and anisotropy of QWT. Finally, the strong potential use of QWT in color image recognition is materialized in a chromatic face recognition system by establishing invariant color features. Extensive experimental results are presented to highlight the exciting properties of QWT. © 2010 Springer-Verlag London Limited.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028381","afid":"60028381","affilname":"Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana -Unidad Iztapalapa","affiliation-city":"Iztapalapa","affiliation-country":"Mexico"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025084","afid":"60025084","affilname":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book","subtype":"ch","subtypeDescription":"Book Chapter","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55695017800","authid":"55695017800","authname":"Xu Y.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Yi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7406503333","authid":"7406503333","authname":"Yang X.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Xiaokang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402537534","authid":"7402537534","authname":"Song L.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Li","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602740478","authid":"6602740478","authname":"Traversoni L.","surname":"Traversoni","given-name":"Leonardo","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028381"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57716169400","authid":"57716169400","authname":"Lu W.","surname":"Lu","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]}],"source-id":"21100282180","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84863963265"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84863963265?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84863963265&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84863963265&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84863963265","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84863963265","eid":"2-s2.0-84863963265","dc:title":"Proceedings of the International Symposium on Evolving Intelligent Systems - A Symposium at the AISB 2010 Convention","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the International Symposium on Evolving Intelligent Systems - A Symposium at the AISB 2010 Convention","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"190295694X"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781902956947"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2010-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2010","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 13 papers.

This work is an extension of our previous work on the dimensional synthesis of planar 6R closed chains using the aforementioned approach. The theoretical underpinning of this work is based on representation of spherical displacements by quaternions and the kinematic mapping approach. In this way, motion of the coupler of a spherical 6R chain motion maps to a rational curve and the kinematic constraints of a spherical 6R closed chain map to hyper-dimensional algebraic surfaces in the image space of spherical displacements. Thus, the problem of determining dimensional parameters of the chain is reduced to finding the surface parameters that satisfy the geometry of the curve. This, in turn, resolves into satisfying the kinematic constraints of the chain. We provide designers an interactive, user friendly graphical tool that allows them to visually contain the image curve by simple geometric manipulation of the size, orientation, and the location of the constraint surfaces. This simple and straightforward design process lends designers an understanding of the mechanism design methodology. © 2010 by ASME.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026415","afid":"60026415","affilname":"Stony Brook University","affiliation-city":"Stony Brook","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16068884300","authid":"16068884300","authname":"Purwar A.","surname":"Purwar","given-name":"Anurag","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026415"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55865237400","authid":"55865237400","authname":"Wu J.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Jun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026415"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57198677147","authid":"57198677147","authname":"Gupta A.","surname":"Gupta","given-name":"Aditya","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026415"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101922139","authid":"7101922139","authname":"Jeffrey Ge Q.","surname":"Jeffrey Ge","given-name":"Q.","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026415"}]}],"source-id":"91976","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80054773126"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80054773126?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80054773126&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80054773126&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80054773126","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:80054773126","eid":"2-s2.0-80054773126","dc:title":"An analysis on image recognition in complex-valued synergetic computers","dc:creator":"Kimura M.","prism:publicationName":"SCIS and ISIS 2010 - Joint 5th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems and 11th International Symposium on Advanced Intelligent Systems","prism:pageRange":"1403-1408","prism:coverDate":"2010-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2010","dc:description":"Synergetic Computers(SCs) are a type of selforganizing ones and have widely been used for pattern recognition or classification problems.

Some examples are the installation of anchorage devices, manifolds or production line supports. The main problem associated with the estimation of the position and the trajectory of the equipment is related to the fact that, systems such as GPSs and magnetometers cannot be used in subsea conditions. Gyrocompass and precise inertial sensors can be used, but they are expensive equipments and there is the risk of damaging during the launch process. The solution is to develop cost-effective inertial positioning systems that reach the operational requirements related to measuring accuracy. These equipments are based on MEMS (Micro-Electrical Mechanical Systems) inertial sensors that are relatively cheap. However, without the proper care, the signals obtained by these equipments present large levels of noise, bias and poor repeatability. The aim is to show a sequence of test procedures, treatment and processing of signals that leads one to know the position, attitude and trajectory of a submarine device. Furthermore, it allows the quantification of errors and, eventually, their sources. A commercial IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) was chosen as a case study. It is equipped with MEMS sensors, usually adopted by the automobile industry. Tests with IMU were carried out intending to find the sensors scale factors, their bias and temperature sensitivity. Thereafter, the data were processed by two distinct algorithms. The first one is a simple algorithm that computes the attitude, azimuth at the final position and calculates the terminal velocity during the launch. The second one integrates the signal along all the movement by using quaternions algebra, resulting in the complete trajectory of the body. Discussions about the accuracy, applicability and limitations of each method are presented.

This is achieved by casting the three components of wind speed (two horizontal and a vertical) into a pure quaternion and adding air temperature as a scalar component, to form the full quaternion. First, HR calculus is introduced in order to provide a unifying framework for the calculation of the derivatives of both analytic quaternion valued functions and real functions of quaternion variables, such as the standard cost function (error power). The analysis shows that the maximum change in the gradient is in the direction of the conjugate of the weight vector, conforming with the gradient calculation in the complex domain. For rigour, we also illustrate that the widely linear model is required in order to capture full second order information within three- and four-dimensional quaternion valued signals. The so established framework is used to illustrate a convenient way to derive the recently introduced quaternion least mean square (QLMS) and the widely linear QLMS (WL-QLMS).

Typically, gravity measurements are mixed up with motion accelerations, magnetometer signals suffer from local electro-magnetic interferences, and final fusion leads to drift. This paper presents a Multi-model Kalman Filter (MKF) method for the fusion of multiple sensory data, to obtain accurate orientation estimation by reducing the effects of interferences. Four measurement models are defined according to the types and levels of interferences. The orientations calculated from accelerations and magnetic data are used as measurements to adaptively fuse with angular rate data.
