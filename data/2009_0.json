It is based on the quaternion representation for the structural information of color images. Quaternions are used to encode the pixels of a color image into a quaternion matrix. Local variance of the luminance layer of color image is taken as the real part of a quaternion, then the three RGB channels of the color image are encoded into the three imaginary parts of the quaternion. The angle between the singular value feature vectors of the quaternion matrices corresponding to the source image and the fused image is used to measure the structural similarity of them. Different weight is given to the source images by using variance. The experiment results show that the proposed assessment method is consistent with the HVS. The color information of a color image can be fully used by this method. It can give an accurate assessment result for each fusion algorithm by using the source images and the fused image. © 2009 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027363","afid":"60027363","affilname":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004828","afid":"60004828","affilname":"Changchun Institute of Optics Fine Mechanics and Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203768643","authid":"57203768643","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yuqing","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9238980500","authid":"9238980500","authname":"Zhu M.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Ming","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35234570300","authid":"35234570300","authname":"Pang H.","surname":"Pang","given-name":"Haochen","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36072381800","authid":"36072381800","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image | Human visual system | Image fusion | Quaternion | Singular value decomposition | Variance","article-number":"74981Y","source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/71249143098"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/71249143098?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=71249143098&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=71249143098&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/71249143098","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:71249143098","eid":"2-s2.0-71249143098","dc:title":"Imaging of biological sample using single-shot full-field optical coherence tomography","dc:creator":"Sato M.","prism:publicationName":"Pacific Rim Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics, CLEO -

evaluate the el-lipticity of polarized signals generated by seismic ambient vibrations. Classically, the estimation of Rayleigh wave ellipticity is performed using a spectrum ratio approach [15]. Here, we propose to use two single-sensor techniques (based on ellipse fitting [8] and random decrement [2]) and one multi-sensor technique (based on quaternion-MUSIC [12]) to substitute the existing algorithm. Rayleigh wave ellipticity is an important geophysical parameter because its estimation as a function of frequency leads to velocity vs. depth estimation, i.e. identification of the underground structure. We illustrate the three algorithms on simulation data and compare them to the existing approach. © EURASIP, 2009.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008134","afid":"60008134","affilname":"CNRS Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique","affiliation-city":"Paris","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35072763200","authid":"35072763200","authname":"Hobiger M.","surname":"Hobiger","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008134"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6507015909","authid":"6507015909","authname":"Bihan N.L.","surname":"Bihan","given-name":"Nicolas Le","initials":"N.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008134"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7801359333","authid":"7801359333","authname":"Cornou C.","surname":"Cornou","given-name":"Cécile","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008134"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004123744","authid":"7004123744","authname":"Bard P.Y.","surname":"Bard","given-name":"Pierre Yves","initials":"P.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008134"}]}],"source-id":"21100204301","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/82155193039"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/82155193039?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=82155193039&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=82155193039&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/82155193039","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:82155193039","eid":"2-s2.0-82155193039","dc:title":"Kinematic convexity of planar displacements based on an approximately bi-invariant metric","dc:creator":"Ge Q.J.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780791849040"}],"prism:volume":"7","prism:issueIdentifier":"PARTS A AND B","prism:pageRange":"1305-1313","prism:coverDate":"2009-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2009","prism:doi":"10.1115/DETC2009-87812","dc:description":"This paper explores the concept of kinematic convexity of planar displacements as an extension of the projective convexity in computational geometry to planar kinematics.

This approach is implemented in an interactive software tool that provides mechanism designers with an intuitive way to determine the dimensional parameters of planar mechanisms, and in the process equips them with an understanding of the design process. The theoretical foundation of this work is based on representing planar displacements with planar quaternions which can be seen as points in a special higher dimensional projective space (called the image space), and on formulating the kinematic constraints of closed chains as algebraic surfaces in the image space. Kinematic constraints under consideration limit the positions and orientation of the coupler in its workspace. In this way, a given motion of a mechanism in the Cartesian space maps to a curve in the image space that has to stay within the bounds of the algebraic surfaces. Thus, the problem of dimensional synthesis is reduced to determining parameters of equations that describe algebraic surfaces. This paper is an extension of our previous work in which we had presented some preliminary results based on an optimization method. We show that the interactive approach presented here is general in nature, and can be easily used for the dimensional synthesis of any mechanism for which kinematic constraints can be expressed algebraically. The process of designing is fast, intuitive, and especially useful when an optimization based approach would be computationally demanding, and mathematically difficult to formulate. This simple approach also provides a basis for students and early designers to learn and understand the process of mechanism design by simple geometric manipulations.

To reduce the number of injuries and fatalities through vehicle design improvements, it is important to study occupant kinematics and related injury mechanisms during crashes. Occupant motion in crash tests is typically measured with high speed video, spatial scanning, direct field sensing, and inertial sensing. In this work, we present simulation and testing results on inertial sensing of dummy kinematics based on a novel algorithm known as Quaternion Fuzzy Logic Adaptive Signal Processing for Biomechanics (QFLASP-B). This approach uses three angular rates and three accelerations (one gyroscope-accelerometer pair about each axis) per rigid body to compute orientations (roll, pitch and yaw), positions and velocities in the inertial (fixed) reference frame. In QFLASP-B, quaternion errors and gyro biases are calculated and used in an adaptive loop to remove their effects. The Fuzzy Estimator at the core of the algorithm consists of a fuzzification process, an inference mechanism, a Rule Base and a defuzzification process. In this paper, we examine those aspects of the QFLASP-B Fuzzy Estimator critical to accurate kinematics sensing, hardware and software implementations and experimental results compared with traditional approaches.

Thus, vectors are used to represent directions and points in space, while matrices are used to model transformations. LA, however, presents some well-known limitations for performing geometric computations. As a result, one often needs to aggregate different formalisms (e.g., quaternions and Plücker coordinates) to obtain complete solutions. Unfortunately, such extensions are not fully compatible among themselves, and one has to get used to jumping back and forth between formalisms, filling in the gaps between them. Geometric algebra (GA), on the other hand, is a mathematical framework that naturally generalizes and integrates useful formalisms such as complex numbers, quaternions and Plücker coordinates into a high-level specification language for geometric operations. Due to its consistent structure, GA equations are often universal and generally applicable. They extend the same solution to higher dimensions and to all kinds of geometric elements, without having to handle special cases, as it happens in conventional techniques. This tutorial aims at introducing the fundamental concepts of GA as a powerful mathematical tool to describe and solve geometric problems in visual computing. © 2009 IEEE.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006726","afid":"60006726","affilname":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul","affiliation-city":"Porto Alegre","affiliation-country":"Brazil"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/19337088600","authid":"19337088600","authname":"Fernandes L.","surname":"Fernandes","given-name":"Leandro A.F.","initials":"L.A.F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006726"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/10141769500","authid":"10141769500","authname":"Oliveira M.","surname":"Oliveira","given-name":"Manuel M.","initials":"M.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006726"}]}],"authkeywords":"Applied mathematics | Geometric algebra | Geometric computing | Plücker coordinates | Quaternion | Subspaces","article-number":"5395153","source-id":"19700167503","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77949532896"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77949532896?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77949532896&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77949532896&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77949532896","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:77949532896","eid":"2-s2.0-77949532896","dc:title":"A novel hybrid approach based on sub-pattern technique and extended 2DPCA for color face recognition","dc:creator":"Chen S.","prism:publicationName":"ISM 2009 - 11th IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780769538907"}],"prism:pageRange":"630-634","prism:coverDate":"2009-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2009","prism:doi":"10.1109/ISM.2009.24","dc:description":"Recently, in a task of face recognition, some researchers proposed a novel method called Extended Two-Dimensional PCA (E2DPCA) which is an extension to the original 2DPCA for gray face recognition. This method can get a new covariance matrix preserving more local geometric structure information than previous 2DPCA methods and avoid small sample size problem of PCA method. But this approach only considers the global information of face images and only is applied for gray face recognition. Some local information and color information may be ignored. Therefore, in this paper, the sub-pattern technique was combined with E2DPCA based on quaternion matrix for color face recognition. In this paper, this new sub-pattern based E2DPCA(which is called SpE2DPCA) was performed and compared with PCA, 2DPCA, E2DPCA, Sub-pattern PCA(SpPCA) and Sub-pattern 2DPCA(Sp2DPCA) for face recognition.

Recently, person identification using iris features has received a lot of attention in both research and industry communities. This is mainly due to the unique characteristics and texture found in iris images. Most proposed iris recognition techniques are based on gray-level representations. The aim of this paper is to develop a novel method for the automatic recognition and matching of color iris images based on hypercomplex (Quaternion) Gabor wavelets. The performance of Quaternion image representation is compared with that of other representations, and a study of the results is conducted. The well-known IrisCode algorithm, developed by John Daugman, is extended to the color domain. © 2009 IEEE.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009506","afid":"60009506","affilname":"King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals","affiliation-city":"Dhahran","affiliation-country":"Saudi Arabia"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35770292100","authid":"35770292100","authname":"Al-Qunaieer F.","surname":"Al-Qunaieer","given-name":"Fares S.","initials":"F.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009506"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12796039800","authid":"12796039800","authname":"Ghouti L.","surname":"Ghouti","given-name":"Lahouari","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009506"}]}],"article-number":"5376870","source-id":"19700166631","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/76549136908"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/76549136908?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=76549136908&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=76549136908&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/76549136908","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:76549136908","eid":"2-s2.0-76549136908","dc:title":"Assessment of color video quality based on quaternion singular value decomposition","dc:creator":"Zhang F.","prism:publicationName":"6th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery, FSKD 2009","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780769537351"}],"prism:volume":"4","prism:pageRange":"7-10","prism:coverDate":"2009-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2009","prism:doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2009.332","dc:description":"Measurement of visual quality is of fundamental importance for numerous video processing applications.

In this method, each color pixel is represented as a quaternion, whose polar magnitude and polar phase are recovered from the intensity of original grayscale image and color scribbles of user's manual input, respectively. To conduct structure-preserving colorization, color diffusion is restrained across global image structures, which are extracted using hierarchical edge representation along with structural importance measurement. To identify local spatial relationship between neighboring pixels, Gabor wavelets are applied to compute the similarity of local phase patterns. Our method is highlighted in well preserving image structures during colorization, where the color image is acquired by solving a linearly constrained quadratic optimization problem. Specifically, we develop a method to guide the user to scribble on the monochrome image, so that effective color propagation from less manual input can be expected. Experimental results demonstrate that our colorization method outperforms the state-of-the-art method in structural preservation and relatively better colorization results are available if the proposed rule of scribble user guidance is adopted. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/101240930","afid":"101240930","affilname":"Institute of Image Communication and Information Processing","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55730409700","authid":"55730409700","authname":"Yu Z.","surname":"Yu","given-name":"Zhou","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"101240930"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55695017800","authid":"55695017800","authname":"Xu Y.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Yi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"101240930"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7406503333","authid":"7406503333","authname":"Yang X.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Xiaokang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"101240930"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402537534","authid":"7402537534","authname":"Song L.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Li","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"101240930"}]}],"authkeywords":"Colorization | Scribble user guidance | Structure preserving","source-id":"25674","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/75249102141"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/75249102141?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=75249102141&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=75249102141&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/75249102141","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:75249102141","eid":"2-s2.0-75249102141","dc:title":"Data fusion based on 3D reconstruction for CAG and intravascular ultrasound images","dc:creator":"Wang O.","prism:publicationName":"Chinese Journal of Biomedical Engineering","prism:issn":"02588021","prism:volume":"28","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"834-839","prism:coverDate":"2009-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2009","dc:description":"Data fusion based on biplane angiography and intravascular ultrasound images can help doctors diagnose the coronary disease in clinic.

Then the eccentric angle of the intravascular ultrasound images were figured out, according to the spatial relationship between catheter and vessel provided by biplane angiography images and intravascular ultrasound images. Finally, the accurate angle between the base axis and the reference axis were given for the intravascular ultrasound images in the catheter by quaternion method.

This paper proposes a high-dimensional descriptive way about multispectral image. Geometrical properties of high-dimensional structures underlying a set of samples are learned via successive projections from the higher dimension to the lower dimension until Clifford space, under guidance of the established properties and theorems in high-dimensional descriptive way. Specifically, we introduce a principle of homology continuity based on Clifford Algebra and provides a geometrical learning algorithm for specifying Clifford Algebra shapes, which is then applied to biomimetic pattern recognition.
