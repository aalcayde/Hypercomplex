These solutions are mostly used in the autonomous industry to properly detect cars' orientation on street scenes. Most solutions and publicly available datasets refer to only one axis orientation (axis parallel to the road), while two others are set to zero. In this paper, we propose a new way of representing a 3D object orientation that is not limited only to the autonomous industry. Our proposal uses Euler angle representation and two coordinate systems (one from the camera and one from the detected object) to define angle orientation for each axis in 3D space. Because this approach is supposed to be used in creating datasets and solutions in the deep learning field, there are some restrictions to be considered to properly train your solution. To better represent the proposal of 3D orientation and its purpose, it is necessary to visualize the bounding box around the detected object, which will follow its orientation. The visualization part is being done using computer-generated images (CGI), while the algorithmic part uses quaternions instead of Euler angles for the rotation of the 3D bounding box.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60068801","afid":"60068801","affilname":"University of Novi Sad","affiliation-city":"Novi Sad","affiliation-country":"Serbia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/126197656","afid":"126197656","affilname":"Machine Can See D.o.o.","affiliation-city":"Novi Sad","affiliation-country":"Serbia"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57223103293","authid":"57223103293","authname":"Stojanovic N.","surname":"Stojanovic","given-name":"Nikola","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"126197656"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57695576800","authid":"57695576800","authname":"Pantic V.","surname":"Pantic","given-name":"Vasilije","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"126197656"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57223109117","authid":"57223109117","authname":"Damjanovic V.","surname":"Damjanovic","given-name":"Vladan","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"126197656"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36159050800","authid":"36159050800","authname":"Vukmirovic S.","surname":"Vukmirovic","given-name":"Srdan","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60068801"}]}],"authkeywords":"computer vision | geometry | pose estimation","source-id":"21101089327","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85129489316"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85129489316?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85129489316&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85129489316&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85129489316","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85129489316","eid":"2-s2.0-85129489316","dc:title":"RANDOMIZED QUATERNION SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION FOR LOW-RANK MATRIX APPROXIMATION","dc:creator":"Liu Q.","prism:publicationName":"SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing","prism:issn":"10648275","prism:eIssn":"10957197","prism:volume":"44","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"A870-A900","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1137/21M1418319","dc:description":"This paper presents a randomized quaternion singular value decomposition (QSVD) algorithm for low-rank matrix approximation problems, which are widely used in color face recognition, video compression, and signal processing problems. With quaternion normal distribution-based random sampling, the randomized QSVD algorithm projects high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional subspace and then identifies an approximate range subspace of the quaternion matrix. The key statistical properties of quaternion Wishart distribution are proposed and used to perform the approximation error analysis of the algorithm. Theoretical results show that the randomized QSVD algorithm can trace dominant singular value decomposition triplets of a quaternion matrix with acceptable accuracy. Numerical experiments also indicate the rationality of proposed theories. Applied to color face recognition problems, the randomized QSVD algorithm obtains higher recognition accuracies and behaves more efficient than the known Lanczos-based partial QSVD and a quaternion version of the fast frequent directions algorithm.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073460","afid":"60073460","affilname":"China University of Mining and Technology","affiliation-city":"Xuzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023813","afid":"60023813","affilname":"Shanghai University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004691","afid":"60004691","affilname":"Jiangsu Normal University","affiliation-city":"Xuzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7406295723","authid":"7406295723","authname":"Liu Q.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Qiaohua","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35109426500","authid":"35109426500","authname":"Ling S.","surname":"Ling","given-name":"Sitao","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073460"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8264355300","authid":"8264355300","authname":"Jia Z.","surname":"Jia","given-name":"Zhigang","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004691"}]}],"authkeywords":"error analysis | low-rank approximation | quaternion Wishart distribution | randomized quaternion SVD","source-id":"26425","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"21KJA110001","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85129428498"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85129428498?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85129428498&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85129428498&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85129428498","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85129428498","eid":"2-s2.0-85129428498","dc:title":"Privacy-Preserving Color Image Feature Extraction by Quaternion Discrete Orthogonal Moments","dc:creator":"Bi X.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","prism:issn":"15566013","prism:eIssn":"15566021","prism:volume":"17","prism:pageRange":"1655-1668","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2022.3170268","dc:description":"To implement image storage and computation in cloud servers without violating users' privacy, privacy-preserving feature extraction has been a new research interest. The existing works are mainly designed for grayscale images. For color images, they tend to convert them to grayscale images or obtain the results of the combination of single-channel processes. While the capabilities of features extracted from the encrypted color images will be affected if color information and inter-relationship between color channels are ignored. To fully preserve features of color images, we introduce quaternion theory to encode each color image and propose an improved vector homomorphic encryption scheme (IVHE) to encrypt quaternion-based color images. IVHE helps protect image content and keep vector characteristics of color images. Based on IVHE, the framework for feature extraction of privacy-preserving Quaternion Discrete Orthogonal Moments (PPQDOMs) is presented. Theoretical analyses prove that Quaternion Discrete Orthogonal Moments (QDOMs) can be extracted from the encrypted color images by PPQDOMs. Furthermore, we apply three common Discrete Orthogonal Moments to the proposed framework to evaluate its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can protect color image content and perform well compared to QDOMs in image reconstruction and image recognition.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020620","afid":"60020620","affilname":"Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56704346000","authid":"56704346000","orcid":"0000-0003-3134-217X","authname":"Bi X.","surname":"Bi","given-name":"Xiuli","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57666005000","authid":"57666005000","orcid":"0000-0002-4858-4602","authname":"Shuai C.","surname":"Shuai","given-name":"Chao","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57196891193","authid":"57196891193","orcid":"0000-0002-3164-6299","authname":"Liu B.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Bo","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201773066","authid":"57201773066","orcid":"0000-0001-8469-5302","authname":"Xiao B.","surname":"Xiao","given-name":"Bin","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36067507500","authid":"36067507500","orcid":"0000-0002-9033-8245","authname":"Li W.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Weisheng","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57305287800","authid":"57305287800","orcid":"0000-0002-7985-0037","authname":"Gao X.","surname":"Gao","given-name":"Xinbo","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]}],"authkeywords":"feature extraction | image recognition | image reconstruction | Privacy-preserving | quaternion discrete orthogonal moments | vector homomorphic encryption","source-id":"4000149002","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85128985465"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85128985465?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85128985465&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85128985465&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85128985465","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85128985465","eid":"2-s2.0-85128985465","dc:title":"Assessing Lower Extremity Kinematics of Roofing Tasks","dc:creator":"Jahani Jirsaraei M.","prism:publicationName":"Construction Research Congress 2022: Health and Safety, Workforce, and Education - Selected Papers from Construction Research Congress 2022","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780784483985"}],"prism:volume":"4-D","prism:pageRange":"481-490","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1061/9780784483985.049","dc:description":"Roofers spend considerable time in awkward postures due to steep-slope rooftops. The combination of these postures, the forces acting on them, and the time spent in such postures increases the chance of roofers developing musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). Several studies have connected these awkward postures to potential risk factors for injuries and disorders; however, existing models are not appropriate in roof workplaces because they are designed to assess work-related risk factors for general tasks. This study examines the impacts of work-related factors, namely working posture and roof slope, on kinematics measurements of body segments in a laboratory setting. To achieve this objective, time-stamped motion data from inertial measurement unit (IMU) devices (i.e., accelerometer, gyroscope, and quaternion signals) were collected from a sample of six undergraduate students at George Mason University. Participants performed two common roofing activities, namely walking along the roof and squatting in different roof slopes (0°, 30°). Comparing IMU signals using statistical analysis demonstrated significant differences in body kinematics between roofing activities on the slope and level ground. Overall, sloped-surface activities on a 30° roof resulted in changes in about 26% of walking and 12% of squatting variables. Such information is useful for a logical understanding of roofing MSD development and may lead to better interventions and guidelines for reducing roofing injuries.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018319","afid":"60018319","affilname":"George Mason University","affiliation-city":"Fairfax","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/106709227","afid":"106709227","affilname":"Volgenau School of Engineering","affiliation-city":"Fairfax","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57643362900","authid":"57643362900","authname":"Jahani Jirsaraei M.","surname":"Jahani Jirsaraei","given-name":"Matin","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018319"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35388139800","authid":"35388139800","authname":"Esmaeili B.","surname":"Esmaeili","given-name":"Behzad","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"106709227"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/27567976200","authid":"27567976200","authname":"Pathak P.","surname":"Pathak","given-name":"Parth","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018319"}]}],"source-id":"21101087129","fund-acr":"NSF","fund-no":"1824238","fund-sponsor":"National Science Foundation","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85128864059"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85128864059?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85128864059&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85128864059&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85128864059","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85128864059","eid":"2-s2.0-85128864059","dc:title":"Proceedings of 2022 SICE International Symposium on Control Systems, SICE ISCS 2022","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of 2022 SICE International Symposium on Control Systems, SICE ISCS 2022","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9784907764746"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 16 papers.

Conventional real-valued convolutional neural networks (RVCNNs) compress a three-channel input image into a single-channel feature map and ignore the relationship among the channels. In contrast, QCNNs deal with the input image as a single quaternion matrix and perform quaternion operation without the reduction of the channels. They can learn the interrelationship among the channel components. Though there exist two types of QCNNs, they have problems, respectively. One type conducts physically unclear quaternion convolution by using simple quaternionic multiplications. The other employs quaternion rotations with fixed axes, resulting in impairment of expression ability. In this article, we propose full-learning rotational QCNNs, which perform quaternion rotation in convolution, and update all the four parameters of a quaternion weight by backpropagation. They realize quaternion rotational convolution with high expression ability. We also propose using two different kinds of features, namely PolSAR pseudocolor features and Stokes vectors normalized by their total power. These two features allow neural networks to learn totally different characteristics of land surface. We train two networks with these features independently. Then, we merge their two classification results to obtain final decision to compensate for the shortcomings of the respective features. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed QCNNs show better classification performance than that of RVCNNs and the two existing QCNNs. We also find that the combination of the two features improves final classification results measured by F-scores.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025272","afid":"60025272","affilname":"The University of Tokyo","affiliation-city":"Tokyo","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57608068300","authid":"57608068300","orcid":"0000-0002-6483-5854","authname":"Matsumoto Y.","surname":"Matsumoto","given-name":"Yuya","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025272"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35795724100","authid":"35795724100","orcid":"0000-0003-2291-4375","authname":"Natsuaki R.","surname":"Natsuaki","given-name":"Ryo","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025272"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35416951600","authid":"35416951600","orcid":"0000-0002-6936-9733","authname":"Hirose A.","surname":"Hirose","given-name":"Akira","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025272"}]}],"authkeywords":"Convolutional neural network (CNN) | polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) | quaternion neural network (QNN)","source-id":"17700155033","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85128181666"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85128181666?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85128181666&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85128181666&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85128181666","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85128181666","eid":"2-s2.0-85128181666","dc:title":"Dynamic Monitoring Method of Physical Training Intensity Based on Wearable Sensors","dc:creator":"Li R.","prism:publicationName":"Mathematical Problems in Engineering","prism:issn":"1024123X","prism:eIssn":"15635147","prism:volume":"2022","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1155/2022/8476595","dc:description":"Physical training data are greatly affected by the human movement state, and the current monitoring method has the problem of low accuracy.

HCR is a challenging multi-label classification task as smartphone sensor values for various contexts (defined as <Activity, Phone Placement>) vary across phone models, and what pocket the user places the phone (proprioception). While realistic, HCR data collected in-The-wild frequently have missing or wrong user-provided context labels or timestamps. In this paper, we propose Quaternion Context Recog-nition under Uncertainty using Fusion and Temporal Learning (QCRUFT), an end-To-end deep learning HCR framework that integrates several mechanisms for mitigating multiple challenges in in-The-wild HCR data including sensor signal variability, extreme data imbalance, and noisy context labels. QCRUFT has two main branches: Branch one uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to analyze handcrafted features. Branch two analyzes raw data using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) followed by a Bi-Directional Quaternion Long Short Term Memory (Bi-QLSTM) model. Initially proposed for speech recognition tasks, QCRUFT innovatively adapts Bi-QLSTMs for HCR. Its quater-nion component captures relationships among strongly correlated spatial features while its Bi-LSTM component learns temporal relationships in bursts of data. QCRUFT also uses quaternions to correct arbitrary user orientations, by rotating the phone back to a universal reference frame. Finally, to mitigate errors in user-supplied context timestamps, QCRUFT incorporates two novel response features, Response Time and Thinking Time, which estimate the quality of user-provided context labels based on participants' delay and the time taken to complete context reports. In rigorous evaluation, QCRUFT achieved 76.4% and 70.6% in overall Balanced Accuracy (BA) on two real-world in-The-wild HCR datasets, improving on the best performing state-of-The-Art baselines by 5.2% and 2.6%, respectively.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011410","afid":"60011410","affilname":"Worcester Polytechnic Institute","affiliation-city":"Worcester","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222367959","authid":"57222367959","authname":"Ge W.","surname":"Ge","given-name":"Wen","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011410"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12790256200","authid":"12790256200","authname":"Agu E.O.","surname":"Agu","given-name":"Emmanuel O.","initials":"E.O.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011410"}]}],"authkeywords":"Deep Learning | Human Context Recognition","source-id":"21101083173","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85127208348"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85127208348?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85127208348&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85127208348&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85127208348","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85127208348","eid":"2-s2.0-85127208348","dc:title":"Recognition Method of Matching Error between Dance Action and Music Beat Based on Data Mining","dc:creator":"Zhu Y.","prism:publicationName":"Security and Communication Networks","prism:issn":"19390114","prism:eIssn":"19390122","prism:volume":"2022","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1155/2022/8176863","dc:description":"Aiming at the problems of low error recognition accuracy and low correlation of data matching in the existing dance action and music beat matching error recognition methods, a dance action and music beat matching error recognition method based on data mining is designed.

The proposed method takes advantages from: i) the QW decomposition, which promotes sparsity and provides structural information about the image data while allowing approximate shift-invariance, to extract meaningful features from low-frequency QW sub-bands, ii) the dimensionality reduction method using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for reducing the complexity of the problem, and iii) the sparse representation of the generated QW features to efficiently learn and capture the meaningful and compact information of this data. After the QW decomposition, the features extracted from low-frequency image sub-bands information are projected, by the PCA, into a new feature space with lower dimensionality. The features extracted from the training samples are used to construct a dictionary, while the features of the test samples are sparsely coded for the classification step. The sparse coding problem is formulated in a QW Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (QWLasso) model applying quaternion l1 minimization. A novel Quaternion Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (QFISTA) is developed to solve the QWLasso model. The experiments conducted on various public image datasets validated that the proposed method possesses higher accuracy, sparsity, and robustness in comparison with several contemporary methods in the field including Neural Networks.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60250855","afid":"60250855","affilname":"Laboratoire de Traitement et Transport de l'Information (L2TI)","affiliation-city":"Villetaneuse","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60092538","afid":"60092538","affilname":"Texas A&amp;M University-Commerce","affiliation-city":"Commerce","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071399","afid":"60071399","affilname":"Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology - HUTECH","affiliation-city":"Ho Chi Minh City","affiliation-country":"Viet Nam"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57207794484","authid":"57207794484","orcid":"0000-0003-1497-3981","authname":"Ngo L.H.","surname":"Ngo","given-name":"Long H.","initials":"L.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60250855"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603651328","authid":"6603651328","orcid":"0000-0002-8299-5448","authname":"Sirakov N.M.","surname":"Sirakov","given-name":"Nikolay M.","initials":"N.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60092538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35409709500","authid":"35409709500","authname":"Luong M.","surname":"Luong","given-name":"Marie","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60250855"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/22036986100","authid":"22036986100","authname":"Viennet E.","surname":"Viennet","given-name":"Emmanuel","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60250855"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603402351","authid":"6603402351","orcid":"0000-0002-5917-4270","authname":"Le-Tien T.","surname":"Le-Tien","given-name":"Thuong","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60071399"}]}],"authkeywords":"Face/object classification | quaternion algebra | quaternion wavelet | sparse representation | wavelet","source-id":"21100374601","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85126510051"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85126510051?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85126510051&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85126510051&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85126510051","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85126510051","eid":"2-s2.0-85126510051","dc:title":"The Generalized HR q-Derivative and Its Application to Quaternion Least Mean Square Algorithm","dc:creator":"Lin D.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","prism:issn":"10709908","prism:eIssn":"15582361","prism:volume":"29","prism:pageRange":"857-861","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/LSP.2022.3158836","dc:description":"Quaternion adaptive filters have been widely used in processing three-dimensional and four-dimensional signals.

Finally, an example of Lorentz chaotic time-series prediction verifies the effectiveness of the proposed $q$-QLMS algorithm.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60122052","afid":"60122052","affilname":"Southwest University","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209805356","authid":"57209805356","authname":"Lin D.","surname":"Lin","given-name":"Dongyuan","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122052"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211914513","authid":"57211914513","orcid":"0000-0002-3683-4520","authname":"Zhang Q.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Qiangqiang","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122052"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57393494600","authid":"57393494600","orcid":"0000-0002-1422-9717","authname":"Chen S.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Shanmou","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122052"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55878634600","authid":"55878634600","orcid":"0000-0002-5028-5839","authname":"Wang S.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Shiyuan","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122052"}]}],"authkeywords":"GHR q-derivative | q-derivative | q-QLMS | Quaternion adaptive filters | quaternion least mean square (QLMS)","source-id":"17316","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"62071391","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85126371461"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85126371461?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85126371461&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85126371461&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85126371461","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85126371461","eid":"2-s2.0-85126371461","dc:title":"A Zero-Watermarking Against Large-Scale Cropping Attack","dc:creator":"Wang J.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering","prism:issn":"18761100","prism:eIssn":"18761119","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789811669620"}],"prism:volume":"813","prism:pageRange":"365-375","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-981-16-6963-7_34","dc:description":"Considering the digital copyright protection of the color image, and aiming at the shortcomings of the existing color image zero-watermarking algorithms against various attacks including image information loss, e.g., cropping, rows and columns removal, and smearing, etc. A color image zero-watermarking algorithm based on quaternion fractional-order generalized Laguerre moments (QFr-GLMs) is proposed.

They have widespread applications in the field of image processing. The recent researches show that fractional-order moments have notable image representation ability. Hermite polynomials are defined over the interval from negative infinity to positive one. Such unboundedness prevents us from developing fractional-order Gaussian-Hermite moments via the existing ideas or approaches. In this paper, we propose fractional-order Gaussian-Hermite moments by forcing the definition domain of Hermite polynomials to be a bounded interval, meanwhile, resorting to a value-decreasing standard deviation to maintain the orthogonality. Moreover, we successfully develop contrast, translation and rotation invariants from the proposed moments based on the inherent properties of Hermite polynomials. The reconstructions of different types of images demonstrate that the proposed moments have more superior image representation ability to the most existing popular orthogonal moments. Besides, the salient performance in invariant image recognition, noise robustness and region-of-interest feature extraction reflect that these moments and their invariants possess the stronger discrimination power and the better noise robustness in comparison with the existing orthogonal moments. Furthermore, both complexity analysis and time consumption indicate that the proposed moments and their invariants are easy to implement, they are suitable for practical engineering applications.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073704","afid":"60073704","affilname":"Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003977","afid":"60003977","affilname":"Northwestern Polytechnical University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"35263255","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57120764600","authid":"57120764600","orcid":"0000-0001-9527-1636","authname":"Yang B.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Bo","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57487578000","authid":"57487578000","authname":"Shi X.","surname":"Shi","given-name":"Xiaojuan","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073704"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192468901","authid":"57192468901","authname":"Chen X.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Xiaofeng","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]}],"authkeywords":"fractional-order Gaussian-Hermite moments | Hermite polynomials | image reconstruction | invariant recognition | region-of-interest feature extraction | volumetric image","source-id":"25534","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85125730507"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85125730507?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85125730507&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85125730507&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85125730507","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85125730507","eid":"2-s2.0-85125730507","dc:title":"MS-DLD: Multi-Sensors Based Daily Locomotion Detection via Kinematic-Static Energy and Body-Specific HMMs","dc:creator":"Ghadi Y.Y.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Access","prism:eIssn":"21693536","prism:volume":"10","prism:pageRange":"23964-23979","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3154775","dc:description":"More adaptable and user-independent techniques are required for multi-sensors based daily locomotion detection (MS-DLD). This research study proposes a couple of locomotion detection methods using body-worn multi-sensors to successfully categorize several locomotion transitions. This research presents both standard and state-of-the-art methods for MS-DLD. Conventionally, to improve MS-DLD process, the proposed methodology consists of a wavelet transformed Quaternion-based filter for the inertial signals, patterns recognition in the form of kinematic-static energies, and state-of-the-art multi-features extraction. These features include entropy, spectral, and cepstral coefficients domains. Then, fuzzy logic-based optimization has been introduced in order to achieve the selective features by converting them into codewords. These nominated features with enhanced patterns are further detected by HMMs to improve the accuracy for classifying daily life locomotion actions. This paper also introduces another state-of-the-art way to model daily locomotion detection and derives body-specific modified HMMs. The model divides the sensor data into three active body-specific parts including head sensors, mid-body sensors, and lower body sensors. Body-specific modified HMMs have been provided with raw data for the three active body-specific sensors and gave better results with less computational complexities when compared to the conventional methods. The proposed systems have been experimentally assessed and trialed over three diverse publicly available datasets: the UP-Fall dataset consisting of falling and other daily life activities, the IM-WSHA dataset comprising everyday locomotion actions, and the ENABL3S gait and locomotion dataset consisting of multiple gait movements. Experimental outcomes indicate that the proposed conventional technique achieved improved results and outperformed existing systems based on detection accuracies of 90.0% and 87.5% over UP-Fall, 86.0% and 88.3% over IM-WSHA, and 86.7% and 90.0% over ENABL3S datasets for kinematic and static energy patterns, respectively. Further, the results show that the state-of-the-art body-specific modified HMMs method achieved 94.3% and 95.0% over UP-Fall, 92.0% and 93.3% over IM-WSHA, and 90.0% and 95.0% over ENABL3S datasets for kinematic and static patterned signals, respectively. The results of state-of-the-art efficient system show a significant increase in detection accuracy when compared to standard systems.","citedby-count":"17","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true",

paper introduced a rotary binocular vision measurement system (RBVMS) consisting of two cameras and two theodolites, with the latter employed as a two-dimensional rotation platform. The camera was driven by mounting it on the theodolite to cover different areas, effectively increasing the measuring range. In the camera calibration stage, virtual 3D points were generated by accurately moving the planar calibration board. A two-order radial and two-order tangential distortion model was considered. The experimental results showed that the intrinsic parameters of the camera had high stability, and the mean reprojection error was about 0.035 pixels. A unit quaternion method was applied to calibrate the transformation matrix between the camera and the theodolite. By solving the transformation matrix between the two theodolites, the measurement data of each position was unified under a fixed coordinate system. At 500 mm in front of the camera, the camera's field of view was about 200 mm. Two targets of different sizes were measured to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the method. The measurement accuracy of 300 mm and 600 mm targets was about 0.014 mm and 0.027 mm, respectively.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019118","afid":"60019118","affilname":"University of Science and Technology of China","affiliation-city":"Hefei","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56122759000","authid":"56122759000","authname":"Li W.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Weimin","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019118"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57260958400","authid":"57260958400","authname":"Zhou L.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Liujian","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019118"}]}],"authkeywords":"camera calibration | measuring range | unit quaternion | Vision measurement","source-id":"12181","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"50705091","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85124685290"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85124685290?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85124685290&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85124685290&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85124685290","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85124685290","eid":"2-s2.0-85124685290","dc:title":"Carbon content prediction of converter steelmaking endpoint based on quaternion direction statistics of flame image","dc:creator":"Li Q.","prism:publicationName":"Jisuanji Jicheng Zhizao Xitong/Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems, CIMS","prism:issn":"10065911","prism:volume":"28","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"140-148","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"January 2022","prism:doi":"10.13196/j.cims.2022.01.014","dc:description":"Continuous real-time measurement of the carbon content of molten steel in the molten pool is the key to controlling the endpoint carbon content of the converter. The high similarity of flame images at the end of converter makes it difficult to extract flame image features with strong discrimination. To solve this problem, the Quaternion Direction Statistics (QDS) algorithm for image color texture feature extraction was proposed. The quaternion multiplication property was used to rotate the flame image to obtain the quaternion rotation map of the flame image. The quaternion phase of pixel difference in the specified direction and distance of the rotation map were taken as the projection axis, and the quaternion amplitude of the difference was taken as the weight to carry out statistics to obtain characteristics. The histograms at various angles and distances were connected in series and normalized as color texture features of flame images. After the extraction of the flame image features, K-Nearst Neighbors (KNN) regression model was used to predict the carbon content.

Building such huge models undermines their replicability and increases the training instability. Moreover, multi-channel data, such as images or audio, are usually processed by real-valued convolutional networks that flatten and concatenate the input, often losing intra-channel spatial relations. To address these issues related to complexity and information loss, we propose a family of quaternion-valued generative adversarial networks (QGANs). QGANs exploit the properties of quaternion algebra, e.g., the Hamilton product, that allows to process channels as a single entity and capture internal latent relations, while reducing by a factor of 4 the overall number of parameters. We show how to design QGANs and to extend the proposed approach even to advanced models. We compare the proposed QGANs with real-valued counterparts on several image generation benchmarks. Results show that QGANs are able to obtain better FID scores than real-valued GANs and to generate visually pleasing images. Furthermore, QGANs save up to 75 % of the training parameters. We believe these results may pave the way to novel, more accessible, GANs capable of improving performance and saving computational resources.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032350","afid":"60032350","affilname":"Sapienza Università di Roma","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"ch","subtypeDescription":"Book Chapter","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57218250258","authid":"57218250258","authname":"Grassucci E.","surname":"Grassucci","given-name":"Eleonora","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221946563","authid":"57221946563","authname":"Cicero E.","surname":"Cicero","given-name":"Edoardo","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36444807900","authid":"36444807900","authname":"Comminiello D.","surname":"Comminiello","given-name":"Danilo","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]}],"source-id":"21100222537","fund-no":"RG11916B88E1942F","fund-sponsor":"Sapienza Università di Roma","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85124181598"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85124181598?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85124181598&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85124181598&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85124181598","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85124181598","eid":"2-s2.0-85124181598","dc:title":"Color Random Valued Impulse Noise Removal Based on Quaternion Convolutional Attention Denoising Network","dc:creator":"Cao Y.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","prism:issn":"10709908","prism:eIssn":"15582361","prism:volume":"29","prism:pageRange":"369-373","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3135803","dc:description":"A new quaternion convolutional attention denoising network known as DeQCANet for color random-valued impulse noise removal is proposed in this paper.

However, image noise, atmospheric conditions, material distribution and other factors seriously degrade the classification accuracy of HSIs. To alleviate these issues, a new approach, namely adaptive weighted quaternion Zernike moments (AWQZM), is proposed, which extracts effective spatial-spectral features for pixels in HSI classification. The main contributions and novelties of the method are as follows: 1) the AWQZM can adaptively set weights for each pixel in the neighborhood, which not only can flexibly search for homogeneous regions of HSIs, but also can strengthen the similarity of pixels from the same class and the distinctiveness of pixels from different classes; 2) the AWQZM can be constructed in a small subset of bands through a grouping strategy, thereby reducing the computational complexity; and 3) the introduction of quaternions can preserve the spatial correlation among bands and reduce the loss of data information, and the use of quaternion phase information makes the extracted features more informative and discriminative. Moreover, the spectral features and spatial features are combined to achieve better HSI classification results. Experimental results on three benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves better classification performance than other related approaches.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104662","afid":"60104662","affilname":"Wuhan Textile University","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022414","afid":"60022414","affilname":"Wuhan University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004573","afid":"60004573","affilname":"Peking University Health Science Center","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113993446","afid":"113993446","affilname":"Wuhan College","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193685624","authid":"57193685624","orcid":"0000-0002-2398-5565","authname":"Li H.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Huizhen","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104662"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57430736800","authid":"57430736800","orcid":"0000-0003-0424-2819","authname":"Huang H.","surname":"Huang","given-name":"Hua","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113993446"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56780856900","authid":"56780856900","orcid":"0000-0002-0369-4795","authname":"Ye Z.","surname":"Ye","given-name":"Zhijing","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022414"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56184943600","authid":"56184943600","orcid":"0000-0003-4589-3116","authname":"Li H.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Hongfeng","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004573"}]}],"authkeywords":"Hyperspectral image classification | phase information | quaternions | Zernike moments","source-id":"17391","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85123646429"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85123646429?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85123646429&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85123646429&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85123646429","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85123646429","eid":"2-s2.0-85123646429","dc:title":"Hallucinating Color Face Image by Learning Graph Representation in Quaternion Space","dc:creator":"Liu L.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","prism:issn":"21682267","prism:eIssn":"21682275","prism:volume":"52","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"265-277","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 January 2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2020.2979320","dc:description":"Recently, learning-based representation techniques have been well exploited for grayscale face image hallucination. For color images, the previous methods only handle the luminance component or each color channel individually, without considering the abundant correlations among different channels as well as the inherent geometrical structure of data manifold. In this article, we propose a learning-based model in quaternion space with graph representation for color face hallucination. Instead of the spatial domain, the color image is represented in the quaternion domain to preserve correlations among different color channels. Moreover, a quaternion graph is learned to smooth the quaternion feature space, which helps to not only stabilize the linear system but also enclose the inherent topology structure of quaternion patch manifold. Besides, considering that single low-resolution (LR) image patch can just provide limited informative information in representation, we propose to simultaneously encode the query smaller LR patch as well as a larger patch containing the surrounding pixels seated at the same position in the objective. The larger patch with rich patterns is used to compensate the lost information in the query LR patch, which further enhances the manifold consistency assumption between the LR and HR patch spaces.

LRC depends on using the least square algorithm to get the solution of the linear regression equation. To improve the performance of the LRC algorithm, in this paper, we extend the LRC strategy to both quaternion and reduced biquaternion domains to consider image color information. We derive closed-form solutions from the properties of both domains. We also improve on the accuracy of the closed-form solutions using nonlinear optimization.

Computing the relative position of such sub-graphs, the branches, is useful, for instance, to explicitly compute relative spinor images, thus solving the selectivity problem. They also play a role in the description of quotient graphs, which are useful to study matrix groups of arithmetical importance. As in earlier work, we concentrate on orders generated by two quaternions, but extending our method to larger generating sets is quite straightforward. In our previous work, the results were given mainly in terms of the quadratic defect. In the present context, we introduce and characterize an analogous concept for Artin–Scheier extensions, to take care of quaternions generating Galois field extensions. The latter extensions have no non-trivial elements of null trace. For this reason, we state our results in terms of a wider family of algebra presentations, in contrast to the aforementioned work, where we chose a pair of pure quaternions as generators of the order.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012464","afid":"60012464","affilname":"Universidad de Chile","affiliation-city":"Santiago","affiliation-country":"Chile"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6505955285","authid":"6505955285","authname":"Arenas-Carmona L.","surname":"Arenas-Carmona","given-name":"Luis","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012464"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209457649","authid":"57209457649","authname":"Bravo C.","surname":"Bravo","given-name":"Claudio","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012464"}]}],"authkeywords":"Central simple algebras | local fields | maximal orders","source-id":"25800","fund-acr":"CONICYT","fund-no":"1200874","fund-sponsor":"Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85122094019"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85122094019?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85122094019&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85122094019&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85122094019","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85122094019","eid":"2-s2.0-85122094019","dc:title":"A General Framework for Constrained Convex Quaternion Optimization","dc:creator":"Flamant J.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","prism:issn":"1053587X","prism:eIssn":"19410476","prism:volume":"70","prism:pageRange":"254-267","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3137746","dc:description":"This paper introduces a general framework for solving constrained convex quaternion optimization problems in the quaternion domain. To soundly derive these new results, the proposed approach leverages the recently developed generalized\\mathbb {H}\\mathbb {R}-calculus together with the equivalence between the original quaternion optimization problem and its augmented real-domain counterpart. This new framework simultaneously provides rigorous theoretical foundations as well as elegant, compact quaternion-domain formulations for optimization problems in quaternion variables. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we introduce the general form for convex constrained optimization problems in quaternion variables, (ii) we extend fundamental notions of convex optimization to the quaternion case, namely Lagrangian duality and optimality conditions, (iii) we develop the quaternion alternating direction method of multipliers (Q-ADMM) as a general purpose quaternion optimization algorithm. The relevance of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by solving two typical examples of constrained convex quaternion optimization problems arising in signal processing. Our results open new avenues in the design, analysis and efficient implementation of quaternion-domain optimization procedures.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104289","afid":"60104289","affilname":"Université de Lorraine","affiliation-city":"Nancy","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189218541","authid":"57189218541","orcid":"0000-0001-9994-173X","authname":"Flamant J.","surname":"Flamant","given-name":"Julien","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104289"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8345291500","authid":"8345291500","orcid":"0000-0003-4733-6698","authname":"Miron S.","surname":"Miron","given-name":"Sebastian","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104289"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55513010100","authid":"55513010100","orcid":"0000-0002-2373-3480","authname":"Brie D.","surname":"Brie","given-name":"David","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104289"}]}],"authkeywords":"Alternating direction method of multipliers | Optimality conditions | Quaternion convex optimization | Widely affine constraints","source-id":"17391","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85122031445"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85122031445?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85122031445&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85122031445&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S001600322100692X"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85122031445","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85122031445","eid":"2-s2.0-85122031445","dc:title":"Robust image watermarking algorithm based on QWT and QSVD using 2D Chebyshev-Logistic map","dc:creator":"Zhang H.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of the Franklin Institute","prism:issn":"00160032","prism:volume":"359","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"1755-1781","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"January 2022","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jfranklin.2021.11.027","pii":"S001600322100692X","dc:description":"In this paper, a novel watermarking algorithm based on quaternion wavelet transform(QWT) and quaternion singular value decomposition(QSVD) is proposed for copyright protection.

Every block is decomposed by QSVD, and the bits of watermark are embedded in singular vectors or singular values. Moreover, 2D Chebyshev-Logistic map is proposed to encrypt the watermarks and scramble the embedding positions. In the watermarking extraction process, both blind and semi-blind watermarking extraction methods are introduced. Experiments show that proposed watermarking algorithm has good robust against common attacks and has good invisibility.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029322","afid":"60029322","affilname":"Dalian Maritime University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013268","afid":"60013268","affilname":"Taiyuan University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Taiyuan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011592","afid":"60011592","affilname":"Qilu University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Jinan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209296515","authid":"57209296515","orcid":"0000-0003-4281-1461","authname":"Zhang H.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Hao","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013268"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57223329346","authid":"57223329346","authname":"Li Z.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Zhenyu","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013268"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56946383200","authid":"56946383200","authname":"Liu X.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Xilin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013268"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55318994100","authid":"55318994100","authname":"Wang C.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Chunpeng","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011592"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9735589400","authid":"9735589400","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xingyuan","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029322"}]}],"source-id":"27959","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61503375","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
