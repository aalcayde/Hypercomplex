The MAXUS service module (MSM) includes an Attitude and Rate Control System (ARCS). The RCS-function of the ARCS is to despin the experiment payload after separation of the motor and to keep it non-rotating in the microgravity phase. Because of possible high lateral body rates after burnout till motor separation large angular deflections of the payload roll-axis from the local vertical may occur. In this situation the ACS-function is activated, which will drive the payload back into a 45 deg cone around the vertical, in order to use high gain portions of the antenna pattern for adequate TV transmission. The MAXUS-1 ARCS consists of three body-mounted Fibre Optic Gyroscopes, a microcomputer based on the 68020 CPU and a cold-gas reaction system. The computer performs a high-speed (1 kHz) quaternion up-date algorithm including scaling and compensation of the gyro signals, coning correction and Euler angle extraction. The digital controller is of a 3-point relais type with hysteresis, which activates and deactivates the two-stage cold-gas system.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60085129","afid":"60085129","affilname":"OHB System AG","affiliation-city":"Bremen","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6506290151","authid":"6506290151","authname":"Eisfeller B.","surname":"Eisfeller","given-name":"B.","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60085129"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36887528600","authid":"36887528600","authname":"Schmitt G.","surname":"Schmitt","given-name":"G.","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60085129"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190552279","authid":"57190552279","authname":"Lissner A.","surname":"Lissner","given-name":"A.","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60085129"}]}],"source-id":"90271","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0026187229"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0026187229?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0026187229&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0026187229&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0026187229","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0026187229","eid":"2-s2.0-0026187229","dc:title":"Attitude determination and parameter estimation using vector observations.

In the majority of tests performed, the two methods converge to the same estimates in approximately the same number of iterations, but the new algorithm requires about 60 percent more computational effort.

Emphasis is given to finding a solution for the following problem incurred by the use of a long sequence of images: the images taken from a longer distance suffer from a larger noise-to-signal ratio, which results in larger errors in 3-D reconstruction and, thereby, causes a serious degradation in motion estimation. To this end, we have derived a new set of discrete Kalman filter equations for motion estimation: (1) The measurement equation is obtained by analyzing the effect of white Gaussian noise in 2-D images on 3-D positional errors (instead of directly assigning Gaussian noise to 3-D feature points) and by incorporating an optimal 3-D reconstruction under the constraints of consistency satisfaction among 3-D feature points. (2) The state propagation equation, or the system dynamic equation, is formulated by describing the rotation between two consecutive 3-D object poses, based on quaternions and representing the error between the true rotation and the nominal rotation (obtained by 3-D reconstruction) in terms of the measurement noise in 2-D images. Furthermore, we can estimate object position from the estimation of object orientation in such a way that an object position can be directly computed once the estimation of an object orientation is obtained. Simulation results indicate that the Kalman filter equations derived in this paper represent an accurate model for 3-D motion estimation in spite of the first-order approximation used in the derivation. The accuracy of this model is demonstrated by the significant error reduction in the presence of large triangulation errors in a long sequence of images and by a shorter transition period for convergence to the true values. © 1991.","citedby-count":"40","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029311","afid":"60029311","affilname":"University of Southern California","affiliation-city":"Los Angeles","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009037","afid":"60009037","affilname":"Jet Propulsion Laboratory","affiliation-city":"Pasadena","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7601402085","authid":"7601402085","authname":"Lee S.","surname":"Lee","given-name":"Sukhan","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029311"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009037"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603659226","authid":"6603659226","authname":"Kay Y.","surname":"Kay","given-name":"Youngchul","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029311"}]}],"source-id":"34484","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0026255934"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0026255934?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0026255934&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0026255934&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-104996609190036O"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0026255934","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0026255934","eid":"2-s2.0-0026255934","dc:title":"Estimating 3-D location parameters using dual number quaternions","dc:creator":"Walker M.","prism:publicationName":"CVGIP: Image Understanding","prism:issn":"10499660","prism:volume":"54","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"358-367","prism:coverDate":"1991-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 1991","prism:doi":"10.1016/1049-9660(91)90036-O","pii":"104996609190036O","dc:description":"This paper describes a new algorithm for estimating the position and orientation of objects.

MADS was previously developed, analyzed, and tested via computer simulations, with the intent of providing attitude knowledge for the LACE experiments. In the simplest implementation, MADS requires a magnetometer and an on-board computer, but all data processing can be done on the ground. Three-axis magnetometer measurements, in conjunction with the spacecraft ephemeris data and a geomagnetic field model, provide sufficient information to determine/estimate both the spacecraft three-axis attitude and the corresponding attitude rates. The MADS design incorporates an extended Kalman filter to combine the series of single-vector attitude measurements into a three-axis attitude estimate. The filter estimates an attitude quaternion, angular rates, and constant (slow random walk) disturbance torques. The filter explicitly models the spacecraft attitude dynamics by integrating Euler's equations and the quaternion kinematics. The covariance is propagated via a discrete-time equation, and the state transition matrix of the systm is derived via numerical differentiation with respect to the initial conditions of the system dynamics. The filter's attitude estimate has been compared with conical Earth scanner roll and pitch measurements, and the filter has been re-tuned to reduce its errors. With the data provided for this analysis, the LACE MADS is capable of 3σ accuracies of 1.8° in roll, 2.4° in pitch, and 2.8° in yaw. The limiting factors to accuracy with respect to the disturbances seem to be the ability to correctly model inertia parameters and the magnetically anchored damper. On the measurements side, the accuracy is limited by the ability to correctly model and/or measure the Earth's magnetic field. Filter convergence never seemed to be a problem. Good attitude tracking performance was achieved even for substantial librational motion. This indicates the suitability of such a system for generating feedback signals to an active libration damper or stiffener.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100345804","afid":"100345804","affilname":"ITHACO Inc","affiliation-city":"Ithaki","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401924483","authid":"7401924483","authname":"Fox S.","surname":"Fox","given-name":"S.

To this end, a set of discrete Kalman filter equations is derived, based on the following: 1) the orientation error of the object frame due to the measurement noise in 2-D images is modeled with reference to the camera frame; 2) an extended Jacobian matrix is formulated by combining the result of 1) with the orientation error of the end-effector frame; and 3) the rotational motion of an object, which is nonlinear in nature, is linearized based on quaternions. Motion parameters are computed from the estimated quaternions based on the iterated least-squares method. Simulation results show a significant reduction in estimation errors.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029311","afid":"60029311","affilname":"University of Southern California","affiliation-city":"Los Angeles","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603659226","authid":"6603659226","authname":"Kay Y.","surname":"Kay","given-name":"Youngchul","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029311"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7601402085","authid":"7601402085","authname":"Lee S.","surname":"Lee","given-name":"Sukhan","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029311"}]}],"source-id":"25456","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
