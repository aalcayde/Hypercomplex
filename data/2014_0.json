It means the model should perform without any learning process and by as little knowledge about their distortion as possible. Most previously methods measure the quality of an image degraded by a single degradation. Single degradation relies on a great degree of accuracy while, they aren't appropriate to be performed for a combination of two degradations. In this paper a new method is proposed which is able to evaluate the degradation of combination of blur and desaturation. Moreover, it has proven that the natural images have regular statistical characteristics and thus, the proposed method relies on color characteristics. These characteristics are measurably modified where distortion exists. Thus we extract some natural scene statistic features which are enabling the prediction of the image quality score without any training process.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018870","afid":"60018870","affilname":"Semnan University","affiliation-city":"Semnan","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56483297400","authid":"56483297400","authname":"Kalatehjari E.","surname":"Kalatehjari","given-name":"Ehsanhosein","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018870"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56152455800","authid":"56152455800","authname":"Yaghmaee F.","surname":"Yaghmaee","given-name":"Farzin","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018870"}]}],"authkeywords":"blind image quality assesment | color processing | quaternion image processing","article-number":"6993396","source-id":"21100367161","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84912013894"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84912013894?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84912013894&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84912013894&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84912013894","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84912013894","eid":"2-s2.0-84912013894","dc:title":"Non-harmonic quaternion Fourier transform and uncertainty principle","dc:creator":"Fu Y.X.","prism:publicationName":"Integral Transforms and Special Functions","prism:issn":"10652469","prism:eIssn":"14768291","prism:volume":"25","prism:issueIdentifier":"12","prism:pageRange":"998-1008","prism:coverDate":"2014-12-13","prism:coverDisplayDate":"13 December 2014","prism:doi":"10.1080/10652469.2014.961010","dc:description":"The quaternionic Fourier transform (QFT) plays a vital role in the representation of signals and transforms a quaternionic 2 D signal into a quaternion-valued frequency domain signal.

Conventionally, training-based methods assume that anomalies are events with rare appearance, which suffer from visual scale, complexity of normal events and insufficiency of training data. Instead, we make the assumption that anomalies are events that attract human attentions. Temporal and spatial anomaly saliency are considered consistently by representing the value of each pixel in each frame as a quaternion composed of intensity, contour, motion-speed and motion-direction feature. For each quaternion frame, Quaternion Discrete Cosine Transformation (QDCT) and signature operation are applied. The spatio-temporal anomaly saliency map is developed by inverse QDCT and Gaussian smoothing. Abnormal events appear at those areas with high saliency values. Experiments on typical datasets show that our method can achieve high accuracy results.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60102083","afid":"60102083","affilname":"Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology","affiliation-city":"Shenzhen","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002798","afid":"60002798","affilname":"Chinese University of Hong Kong","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56118879800","authid":"56118879800","authname":"Guo H.","surname":"Guo","given-name":"Huiwen","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102083"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102083"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7407065301","authid":"7407065301","authname":"Wu X.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Xinyu","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102083"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102083"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002798"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55556478600","authid":"55556478600","authname":"Li N.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Nannan","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102083"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102083"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56418050900","authid":"56418050900","authname":"Wang H.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Huan","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102083"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102083"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/46461232000","authid":"46461232000","authname":"Chen Y.L.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Yen Lun","initials":"Y.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102083"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102083"}]}],"article-number":"6982654","source-id":"21100365545","fund-no":"61473277","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84920730619"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84920730619?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84920730619&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84920730619&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84920730619","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84920730619","eid":"2-s2.0-84920730619","dc:title":"Color image segmentation using improved graph cuts","dc:creator":"Li L.","prism:publicationName":"Wuhan Daxue Xuebao (Xinxi Kexue Ban)/Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University","prism:issn":"16718860","prism:volume":"39","prism:issueIdentifier":"12","prism:pageRange":"1504-1508","prism:coverDate":"2014-12-05","prism:coverDisplayDate":"5 December 2014","prism:doi":"10.13203/j.whugis20130188","dc:description":"A novel unsupervised color image segmentation method using graph cuts with multiple components is proposed, which can overcome the problem of the higher computational complexity caused by more labels during inferring by graph cuts. First, the quaternion cut-off window feature and CIE Lab color feature of a given image are extracted and fused based on the gradient information of the image. Then the segmentation is formulated as a labeling problem and solved by an iterative process based on graph cuts and maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. At each iteration, the connected regions in a segment are handled as sub-components of the segment instead of relabeling them with unique labels. In doing so, the number of labels does not increase, and thus the computational complexity can be reduced during inference by graph cuts. Finally, the segmentation result is obtained after removing some weak edges. Experimental results and theoretical proof demonstrate the good performance of the proposed method.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025761","afid":"60025761","affilname":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017970","afid":"60017970","affilname":"Henan University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Zhengzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56104314900","authid":"56104314900","authname":"Li L.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Lei","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017970"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54386865900","authid":"54386865900","authname":"Dong Z.","surname":"Dong","given-name":"Zhuoli","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017970"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image segmentation | Cut-off window | Maximum likelihood estimation | Multi-component graph cuts","source-id":"27930","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84928199352"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84928199352?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84928199352&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84928199352&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84928199352","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84928199352","eid":"2-s2.0-84928199352","dc:title":"Quaternion softmax classifier","dc:creator":"Zeng R.","prism:publicationName":"Electronics Letters","prism:issn":"00135194","prism:volume":"50","prism:issueIdentifier":"25","prism:pageRange":"1929-1931","prism:coverDate":"2014-12-04","prism:coverDisplayDate":"4 December 2014","prism:doi":"10.1049/el.2014.2526","dc:description":"For the feature extraction of red-blue-green (RGB) colour images, researchers usually deal with R, G and B channels separately to obtain three feature vectors, and then combine them together to obtain a long real feature vector. This approach does not exploit the relationships between the three channels of the colour images. Recently, attention has been paid to quaternion features, which take the relationships between channels into consideration and seem to be more suitable for representing colour images. However, there are only a few quaternion classifiers for dealing with quaternion features. To meet this requirement, a new quaternion classifier, namely, the quaternion softmax classifier is proposed, which is an extended version of the conventional softmax classifier generally defined in the complex (or real) domain. The proposed quaternion softmax classifier is applied to two of the most common quaternion features, that is, the quaternion principal components analysis feature and the colour image pixel feature. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than the quaternion back propagation neural network in terms of accuracy and convergence rate.","citedby-count":"42","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60128870","afid":"60128870","affilname":"Key Laboratory of Computer Network and Information Integration, Ministry of Education","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57646836600","authid":"57646836600","authname":"Zeng R.","surname":"Zeng","given-name":"Rui","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60128870"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34874119700","authid":"34874119700","authname":"Wu J.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Jiasong","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60128870"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55849891700","authid":"55849891700","authname":"Shao Z.","surname":"Shao","given-name":"Zhuhong","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60128870"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004293671","authid":"7004293671","authname":"Senhadji L.","surname":"Senhadji","given-name":"Lotfi","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60128870"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7203086899","authid":"7203086899","authname":"Shu H.","surname":"Shu","given-name":"Huazhong","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60128870"}]}],"source-id":"24918","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84914133308"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84914133308?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84914133308&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84914133308&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84914133308","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84914133308","eid":"2-s2.0-84914133308","dc:title":"Magnetic, acceleration fields and gyroscope quaternion (MAGYQ)-based attitude estimation with smartphone sensors for indoor pedestrian navigation","dc:creator":"Renaudin V.","prism:publicationName":"Sensors (Switzerland)","prism:issn":"14248220","prism:volume":"14","prism:issueIdentifier":"12","prism:pageRange":"22864-22890","prism:coverDate":"2014-12-02","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2 December 2014","prism:doi":"10.3390/s141222864","dc:description":"The dependence of proposed pedestrian navigation solutions on a dedicated infrastructure is a limiting factor to the deployment of location based services. Consequently self-contained Pedestrian Dead-Reckoning (PDR) approaches are gaining interest for autonomous navigation. Even if the quality of low cost inertial sensors and magnetometers has strongly improved, processing noisy sensor signals combined with high hand dynamics remains a challenge. Estimating accurate attitude angles for achieving long term positioning accuracy is targeted in this work. A new Magnetic, Acceleration fields and GYroscope Quaternion (MAGYQ)-based attitude angles estimation filter is proposed and demonstrated with handheld sensors. It benefits from a gyroscope signal modelling in the quaternion set and two new opportunistic updates: magnetic angular rate update (MARU) and acceleration gradient update (AGU). MAGYQ filter performances are assessed indoors, outdoors, with dynamic and static motion conditions. The heading error, using only the inertial solution, is found to be less than 10° after 1.5 km walking. The performance is also evaluated in the positioning domain with trajectories computed following a PDR strategy.","citedby-count":"128","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60269958","afid":"60269958","affilname":"Géolocalisation (AME-GEOLOC)","affiliation-city":"Bouguenais","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25634925800","authid":"25634925800","authname":"Renaudin V.","surname":"Renaudin","given-name":"Valérie","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60269958"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56298346100","authid":"56298346100","authname":"Combettes C.","surname":"Combettes","given-name":"Christophe","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60269958"}]}],"authkeywords":"Acceleration gradient update | Attitude estimation | Indoor navigation | Kalman filter | Magnetic angular rate update | Magnetometer | MEMS | Quaternion","source-id":"130124","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027951628"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027951628?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85027951628&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85027951628&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027951628","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85027951628","eid":"2-s2.0-85027951628","dc:title":"Optimal image watermarking scheme based on chaotic map and quaternion wavelet transform","dc:creator":"Lei B.","prism:publicationName":"Nonlinear Dynamics","prism:issn":"0924090X","prism:eIssn":"1573269X","prism:volume":"78","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"2897-2907","prism:coverDate":"2014-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 December 2014","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11071-014-1634-4","dc:description":"In this paper, an intelligent watermarking scheme optimized by adaptive differential evolution (ADE) is proposed based on chaotic map and quaternion wavelet transform (QWT).

This new representation gives a very good division of the coefficients in terms of magnitude and three-phase angles and generalizes better the concept of analytic signal to image. Furthermore, it retains the property of shift invariant and directivity. We show an application of this transform in satellite image denoising. The proposed approach relies on the adaptation of thresholding procedures based on the dependency between magnitude quaternionic coefficients in local neighborhoods and phase regularization. In addition a non-marginal aspect of multispectral representation is introduced. Thanks to coherent analysis provided by the quaternionic wavelet transformation, the results obtained indicate the potential of this multispectral representation with magnitude thresholding and phase smoothing in noise reduction and edge preservation compared with classical wavelet thresholding methods that do not use phase or multiband information.","citedby-count":"17","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60068759","afid":"60068759","affilname":"Université Mustapha Stambouli de Mascara","affiliation-city":"Mascara","affiliation-country":"Algeria"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60068748","afid":"60068748","affilname":"Université Djillali Liabes de Sidi Bel Abbes","affiliation-city":"Sidi Bel Abbes","affiliation-country":"Algeria"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032653","afid":"60032653","affilname":"Universite de Poitiers","affiliation-city":"Poitiers","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55355545400","authid":"55355545400","authname":"Kadiri M.","surname":"Kadiri","given-name":"Mohammed","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60068748"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60068759"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14062847200","authid":"14062847200","authname":"Djebbouri M.","surname":"Djebbouri","given-name":"Mohamed","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60068748"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36008284700","authid":"36008284700","authname":"Carré P.","surname":"Carré","given-name":"Philippe","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032653"}]}],"authkeywords":"Magnitude thresholding | Multispectral satellite image | Phase regularization | Quaternionic wavelet analysis | Structural similarity measure","article-number":"41","source-id":"5200152707","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84920523015"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84920523015?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84920523015&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84920523015&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84920523015","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84920523015","eid":"2-s2.0-84920523015","dc:title":"Combined adjustment of CE-1 stereo camera image and laser altimeter data","dc:creator":"Zhao S.","prism:publicationName":"Cehui Xuebao/Acta Geodaetica et Cartographica Sinica","prism:issn":"10011595","prism:volume":"43","prism:issueIdentifier":"12","prism:pageRange":"1224-1229","prism:coverDate":"2014-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 December 2014","prism:doi":"10.13485/j.cnki.11-2089.2014.0178","dc:description":"CE-1 carries two types of mapping equipments: CE-1 Lunar laser altimeter and three-line-array stereo camera.

We propose a novel method for simultaneously enhancing both light and dark hairs with variable widths, from dermoscopic images, without the prior knowledge of the hair color. We measure hair tubularness using a quaternion color curvature filter. We extract optimal hair features (tubularness, scale, and orientation) using Markov random field theory and multilabel optimization. We also develop a novel dual-channel matched filter to enhance hair pixels in the dermoscopic images while suppressing irrelevant skin pixels. We evaluate the hair enhancement capabilities of our method on hair-occluded images generated via our new hair simulation algorithm. Since hair enhancement is an intermediate step in a computer-aided diagnosis system for analyzing dermoscopic images, we validate our method and compare it to other methods by studying its effect on: 1) hair segmentation accuracy; 2) image inpainting quality; and 3) image classification accuracy. The validation results on 40 real clinical dermoscopic images and 94 synthetic data demonstrate that our approach outperforms competing hair enhancement methods.","citedby-count":"23","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60193419","afid":"60193419","affilname":"Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute","affiliation-city":"Vancouver","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028379","afid":"60028379","affilname":"British Columbia Cancer Agency","affiliation-city":"Vancouver","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018491","afid":"60018491","affilname":"Simon Fraser University","affiliation-city":"Burnaby","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010365","afid":"60010365","affilname":"The University of British Columbia","affiliation-city":"Vancouver","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"pubmed-id":"25312927","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35180176100","authid":"35180176100","authname":"Mirzaalian H.","surname":"Mirzaalian","given-name":"Hengameh","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018491"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55560463300","authid":"55560463300","authname":"Lee T.K.","surname":"Lee","given-name":"Tim K.","initials":"T.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010365"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60193419"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028379"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603568967","authid":"6603568967","authname":"Hamarneh G.","surname":"Hamarneh","given-name":"Ghassan","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018491"}]}],"authkeywords":"hair enhancement | hair segmentation | light and dark objects | Melanoma | quaternion tubularness filters","article-number":"6918479","source-id":"25534","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84916636901"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84916636901?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84916636901&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84916636901&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84916636901","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84916636901","eid":"2-s2.0-84916636901","dc:title":"Quaternion-based color difference measure for removing impulse noise in color images","dc:creator":"Chen L.","prism:publicationName":"ICCSS 2014 - Proceedings: 2014 International Conference on Informative and Cybernetics for Computational Social Systems","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781479947522"}],"prism:pageRange":"123-127","prism:coverDate":"2014-11-18","prism:coverDisplayDate":"18 November 2014","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICCSS.2014.6961828","dc:description":"This paper introduces a new color difference measure based on quaternion representation and a filtering algorithm for impulse noise removal in color images.

This lemma prescribes the asymptotic behaviour of the QLCT extending and refining the classical Riemann-Lebesgue lemma for the Fourier transform of 2D quaternion signals. We then introduce the QLCT of a probability measure, and we study some of its basic properties such as linearity, reconstruction formula, continuity, boundedness, and positivity. Finally, we extend the classical Bochner-Minlos theorem to the QLCT setting showing the applicability of our approach.","citedby-count":"55","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60116730","afid":"60116730","affilname":"Centro de Investigação e Desenvolvimento em Matemática e Aplicações","affiliation-city":"Aveiro","affiliation-country":"Portugal"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003837546","authid":"7003837546","authname":"Kou K.","surname":"Kou","given-name":"Kit Ian","initials":"K.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/19639247200","authid":"19639247200","authname":"Morais J.","surname":"Morais","given-name":"João","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60116730"}]}],"authkeywords":"Asymptotic behaviour | Bochner-Minlos theorem | Positive definitely measure | Quaternion linear canonical transform | Quaternionic analysis","source-id":"25170","fund-acr":"FCT","fund-no":"11401606","fund-sponsor":"Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84957648237"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84957648237?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84957648237&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84957648237&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84957648237","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84957648237","eid":"2-s2.0-84957648237","dc:title":"On the performance of widely linear quaternion based MVDR beamformer for an acoustic vector sensor","dc:creator":"Cao J.","prism:publicationName":"2014 14th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement, IWAENC 2014","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781479968084"}],"prism:pageRange":"303-307","prism:coverDate":"2014-11-11","prism:coverDisplayDate":"11 November 2014","prism:doi":"10.1109/IWAENC.2014.6954307","dc:description":"Widely linear model has recently been used for signal processing applications due to its ability to achieve better performance than conventional linear filtering for non-circular complex random variables (CRVs) and improper quaternion random variables (QRVs).

The sub-anatomic regions, which include compressive and tensile regions, are delineated using pre-processing procedures. These delineated regions are subjected to quaternion wavelet transforms and statistical parameters are derived from the transformed images. These parameters are correlated with apparent porosity, which is derived from the strength regions. Further, anisotropy is also calculated from the transformed images and is analyzed. Results show that the anisotropy values derived from second and third phase components of quaternion wavelet transform are found to be distinct for normal and abnormal samples with high statistical significance for both compressive and tensile regions. These investigations demonstrate that architectural anisotropy derived from QWT analysis is able to differentiate normal and abnormal samples.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021176","afid":"60021176","affilname":"Anna University","affiliation-city":"Chennai","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005941","afid":"60005941","affilname":"Madras Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Chennai","affiliation-country":"India"}],"pubmed-id":"25571265","prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57224841546","authid":"57224841546","authname":"Sangeetha S.","surname":"Sangeetha","given-name":"S.","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005941"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58493077800","authid":"58493077800","authname":"Sujatha C.M.","surname":"Sujatha","given-name":"C.

In the proposed model, bottom-up (low level) features and top-down (high level) factors are used to compute bottom-up saliency and top-down saliency respectively. Then, the two saliency maps are fused after a normalization operation. In the bottom-up attention model, we use quaternion discrete cosine transform in multi-scale and multiple color spaces to detect static saliency. Meanwhile, multi-scale local motion and global motion conspicuity maps are computed and integrated into motion saliency map. To effectively suppress the background motion noise, a simple histogram of average optical flow is adopted to calculate motion contrast. Then, the bottom-up saliency map is obtained by combining the static and motion saliency maps. In the top-down attention model, we utilize high level stimulus in news video, such as face, person, car, speaker, and flash, to generate the top-down saliency map. The proposed method has been extensively tested by using three popular evaluation metrics over two widely used eye-tracking datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in saliency detection of news videos compared to several state-of-the-art methods.","citedby-count":"13","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029943","afid":"60029943","affilname":"Henan Normal University","affiliation-city":"Xinxiang","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005465","afid":"60005465","affilname":"University of Electronic Science and Technology of China","affiliation-city":"Chengdu","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57199977678","authid":"57199977678","authname":"Wu B.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Bo","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029943"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55748551700","authid":"55748551700","authname":"Xu L.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Linfeng","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]}],"authkeywords":"Bottom-up attention | News video | Top-down attention | Visual saliency","source-id":"25627","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84912101296"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84912101296?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84912101296&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84912101296&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84912101296","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84912101296","eid":"2-s2.0-84912101296","dc:title":"Flight equipment validation with iSAFT: The EUCLID Fine Guidance Sensor case","dc:creator":"Kollias V.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the 6th International SpaceWire Conference, SpaceWire 2014","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780955719653"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2014-10-24","prism:coverDisplayDate":"24 October 2014","prism:doi":"10.1109/SpaceWire.2014.6936278","dc:description":"iSAFT is an integrated powerful HW/SW environment for the simulation, validation & monitoring of satellite/spacecraft on-board data networks supporting simultaneously a wide range of protocols.

The system is composed of a dedicated femoral head trial with a miniature camera set inside the femoral head and a acetabular prosthesis trial with designated patterns placed on the internal surface of the liner. By analyzing the liner images taken by the camera, a set of correspondences between the 3D points and their 2D projections can be established. Then the relative pose is estimated using the correspondences as input. Finally, the result is displayed in 3D graphics in vivo.

Color information and luminance information are two important parts in color image. Loss of color information will result in the low consistency of the assessment results. Aiming to the problem, full-quaternion is defined in this paper. It is used to describe the structure information of a color image. The real part and imagery parts in full quaternion are used to perform the task. It differs from the traditional pure quaternion-based color image description method where the detail information in an image is enhanced by using the real part of a quaternion. To enhance the detail information in an image, local variance of luminance layer and the three color channels are taken as the real part and imagery parts respectively. On the basis of that, the structure similarity (SSIM) measure is studied and the quaternion-based structure similarity measure is used to perform color image structure comparison. Results from the experiments show that the proposed method combines detail information and color information of a color image. It can describe the structure information better than the traditional description methods. The quantitative results reveal that the performance of the full quaternion-based method is better than the pure quaternion-based method and many state-of-the-art methods. The values of Kendall rank correlation coefficient (KRCC), spearman rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) and root mean squared error (RMSE) are 0.692 9, 0.881 8 and 7.506, respectively, which proves that the performance of the proposed method is better than the other methods in the experiment.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007711","afid":"60007711","affilname":"Jilin University","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004828","afid":"60004828","affilname":"Changchun Institute of Optics Fine Mechanics and Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56790197500","authid":"56790197500","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203768643","authid":"57203768643","authname":"Wang Y.Q.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yu Qing","initials":"Y.Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14520520900","authid":"14520520900","authname":"Gu H.J.","surname":"Gu","given-name":"Hai Jun","initials":"H.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55547111891","authid":"55547111891","authname":"Zhao X.H.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Xiao Hui","initials":"X.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]}],"authkeywords":"Full quaternion | Human visual system (HVS) | Image quality assessment | Structure similarity (SSIM)","source-id":"29685","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84901392052"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84901392052?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84901392052&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84901392052&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0957417414002188"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84901392052","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84901392052","eid":"2-s2.0-84901392052","dc:title":"Adaptive color image watermarking by the use of quaternion image moments","dc:creator":"Tsougenis E.","prism:publicationName":"Expert Systems with Applications","prism:issn":"09574174","prism:volume":"41","prism:issueIdentifier":"14","prism:pageRange":"6408-6418","prism:coverDate":"2014-10-15","prism:coverDisplayDate":"15 October 2014","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.eswa.2014.04.021","pii":"S0957417414002188","dc:description":"The first adaptive moment-based color image watermarking is presented in this work. The proposed method exploits rotation invariance, high reconstruction capability and computation accuracy of the quaternion radial moments' (QRMs), subject to the tradeoff between robustness and imperceptibility. The current system manages to multi-embed binary logos to color images applying QRMs as information carriers. A novel adaptive system adjusts the watermark's embedding strength (online) by taking into account image's morphology, with respect to robustness and imperceptibility. The method manages to experimentally justify and further eliminate the attack-free phenomenon that state-of-the-art methods suffer. The simulation results justified that the proposed framework manages to highly secure its carrying information under common signal processing and geometric attacking conditions. Furthermore, the adoption of the novel adaptive process enhances the robustness and imperceptibility requirements by reducing the Bit Error Rate even by 49% and producing even 5db higher PSNR values, respectively. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the quaternion-valued sparse system identification problem is studied for the first time and a zero-attracting quaternion-valued least mean square (LMS) algorithm is derived by considering the l1 norm of the quaternion-valued adaptive weight vector. By incorporating the sparsity information of the system into the update process, a faster convergence speed is achieved, as verified by simulation results.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001881","afid":"60001881","affilname":"The University of Sheffield","affiliation-city":"Sheffield","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56042877600","authid":"56042877600","authname":"Jiang M.","surname":"Jiang","given-name":"Mengdi","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001881"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56645219600","authid":"56645219600","authname":"Liu W.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001881"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56044382000","authid":"56044382000","authname":"Li Y.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Yi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001881"}]}],"authkeywords":"adaptive filtering | LMS algorithm | quaternion | sparsity | system identification","article-number":"6923898","source-id":"21100370160","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84908246489"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84908246489?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84908246489&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84908246489&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84908246489","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84908246489","eid":"2-s2.0-84908246489","dc:title":"Navigation of robotic platform with using inertial measurement unit and Direct Cosine Matrix","dc:creator":"Beran L.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings Elmar - International Symposium Electronics in Marine","prism:issn":"13342630","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789531841993"}],"prism:pageRange":"87-90","prism:coverDate":"2014-10-13","prism:coverDisplayDate":"13 October 2014","prism:doi":"10.1109/ELMAR.2014.6923322","dc:description":"Precise navigation of mobile robots in unknown areas is common problematic in many research. For the robot navigation in exterior is commonly used the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). For better results in exteriors is also possible to use the Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS). In Europe is usually used the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), in US Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS). Unfortunately this precise type of navigation is not suitable for navigation inside buildings and industrial areas, mainly because the weak signal and low position accuracy. For these solutions is necessary to use an alternative systems - independent on satellite navigation. The project SGSFEI-2014002, supported by Internal Grant Agency of University of Pardubice, deals with the mobile robot navigation inside abandoned buildings, industrial constructions and space exploration. For independent calculation of acceleration vectors is necessary to implement Direct Cosine Matrix transformation (DCM) in navigation unit. This article present DCM transform theory and achieved results from performed experiment on measured and simulated data.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005809","afid":"60005809","affilname":"Univerzita Pardubice","affiliation-city":"Pardubice","affiliation-country":"Czech Republic"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55530813200","authid":"55530813200","authname":"Beran L.","surname":"Beran","given-name":"Ladislav","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005809"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55940034900","authid":"55940034900","authname":"Chmelar P.","surname":"Chmelar","given-name":"Pavel","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005809"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26654638100","authid":"26654638100","authname":"Dobrovolny M.","surname":"Dobrovolny","given-name":"Martin","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005809"}]}],"authkeywords":"accelerometers | direct cosine matrix | gyroscope | quaternions | Robotics navigation","article-number":"6923322","source-id":"145063","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84908576864"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84908576864?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84908576864&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84908576864&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84908576864","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84908576864","eid":"2-s2.0-84908576864","dc:title":"Binocular vision method of measuring pose based on perpendicular lines","dc:creator":"Zhao Z.","prism:publicationName":"Guangxue Xuebao/Acta Optica Sinica","prism:issn":"02532239","prism:volume":"34","prism:issueIdentifier":"10","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2014-10-10","prism:coverDisplayDate":"10 October 2014","prism:doi":"10.3788/AOS201434.1015003","dc:description":"For linear features, an algorithm which is based on perpendicular lines is proposed for binocular vision pose measurement. The algorithm is based on linear feature and its projection line on the camera image coplanar property. Unit quaternions is used to simplify model variables. Under the condition of two known perpendicular on object, an analytical solution of object pose can be determined with four lines which is projected by two perpendicular lines on two-camera image. The algorithm is also analyzed when linear vector projected onto the two cameras on the same line, namely linear vector parallel to the two camera position. Matlab simulation results show that the algorithm is robust to noise and can guarantee a certain precision even if the two straight lines have error for vertical. Physical experiments show that the algorithm can meet the general precision requirements.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56403609400","authid":"56403609400","authname":"Zhao Z.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Zhenqing","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102368910","authid":"7102368910","authname":"Ye D.","surname":"Ye","given-name":"Dong","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57114625900","authid":"57114625900","authname":"Chen G.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Gang","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56137514800","authid":"56137514800","authname":"Guo Y.","surname":"Guo","given-name":"Yubo","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]}],"authkeywords":"Binocular vision | Linear features | Machine vision | Pose measurement | Quaternions","article-number":"1015003","source-id":"29717","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
