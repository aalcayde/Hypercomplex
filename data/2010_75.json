Two robust adaptive output feedback controllers based on Chebyshev neural networks (CNN) termed adaptive neural networks (NN) controller-I and adaptive NN controller-II are proposed for the attitude tracking control of spacecraft. The four-parameter representations (quaternion) are employed to describe the spacecraft attitude for global representation without singularities. The nonlinear reduced-order observer is used to estimate the derivative of the spacecraft output, and the CNN is introduced to further improve the control performance through approximating the spacecraft attitude motion. The implementation of the basis functions of the CNN used in the proposed controllers depends only on the desired signals, and the smooth robust compensator using the hyperbolic tangent function is employed to counteract the CNN approximation errors and external disturbances. The adaptive NN controller-II can efficiently avoid the over-estimation problem (i.e., the bound of the CNNs output is much larger than that of the approximated unknown function, and hence, the control input may be very large) existing in the adaptive NN controller-I. Both adaptive output feedback controllers using CNN can guarantee that all signals in the resulting closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded. For performance comparisons, the standard adaptive controller using the linear parameterization of spacecraft attitude motion is also developed. Simulation studies are presented to show the advantages of the proposed CNN-based output feedback approach over the standard adaptive output feedback approach. © 2006 IEEE.","citedby-count":"130","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030838","afid":"60030838","affilname":"Toronto Metropolitan University","affiliation-city":"Toronto","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018486","afid":"60018486","affilname":"Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"20729168","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14038430500","authid":"14038430500","authname":"Zou A.M.","surname":"Zou","given-name":"An Min","initials":"A.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030838"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402676359","authid":"7402676359","authname":"Kumar K.D.","surname":"Kumar","given-name":"Krishna Dev","initials":"K.D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030838"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13102644800","authid":"13102644800","authname":"Hou Z.G.","surname":"Hou","given-name":"Zeng Guang","initials":"Z.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018486"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive control | Chebyshev neural network (CNN) | output feedback | quaternion | spacecraft attitude","article-number":"5551212","source-id":"24243","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"60 775 043","fund-sponsor":"Ryerson University","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77955828076"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77955828076?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77955828076&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77955828076&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77955828076","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:77955828076","eid":"2-s2.0-77955828076","dc:title":"Application of particle filters to vision-based orientation estimation using harmonic analysis","dc:creator":"Schairer T.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","prism:issn":"10504729","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781424450381"}],"prism:pageRange":"2556-2561","prism:coverDate":"2010-08-26","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2010","prism:doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2010.5509951","dc:description":"We investigate the application of particle filters to estimate the orientation of a mobile agent based on an omnidirectional video stream.

A single sensor pack, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), provides all the data required to feed the attitude filter. The design is sensor-driven and departs from traditional solutions as no explicit representations of the attitude, e.g., Euler angles, quaternions, or rotation matrices, are considered in the filter design. Moreover, the proposed solution includes the estimation of rate gyros biases, systematic tuning procedures, and also allows for the inclusion of frequency weights to model colored noise on the different sensor channels. Due to its inherent structure, the filter is complementary, allows for temporary loss of sensor measurements, and also copes well with slowly time-varying rate gyros biases. The performance of the proposed algorithm is experimentally evaluated with a low-cost IMU and resorting to a high precision calibration table, which provides ground truth signals for comparison with the resulting filter estimates. ©2010 IEEE.","citedby-count":"24","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004956","afid":"60004956","affilname":"Instituto Superior Técnico","affiliation-city":"Lisbon","affiliation-country":"Portugal"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/22956950800","authid":"22956950800","authname":"Batista P.","surname":"Batista","given-name":"Pedro","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004956"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56962772800","authid":"56962772800","authname":"Silvestre C.","surname":"Silvestre","given-name":"Carlos","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004956"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55751743873","authid":"55751743873","authname":"Oliveira P.","surname":"Oliveira","given-name":"Paulo","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004956"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35174253800","authid":"35174253800","authname":"Cardeira B.","surname":"Cardeira","given-name":"Bruno","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004956"}]}],"article-number":"5509537","source-id":"25456","fund-acr":"FP7","fund-no":"248497","fund-sponsor":"Seventh Framework Programme","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77955734224"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77955734224?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77955734224&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77955734224&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77955734224","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:77955734224","eid":"2-s2.0-77955734224","dc:title":"Quaternion central divided difference Kalman filtering algorithm and its applications to initial alignment of SINS","dc:creator":"Zhou W.","prism:publicationName":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation, ICIA 2010","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781424457021"}],"prism:pageRange":"1846-1851","prism:coverDate":"2010-08-24","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2010","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICINFA.2010.5512239","dc:description":"Considering the characteristic and computation superiority of quaternion representing body attitude movement information, and aiming at the initial alignment procedure of strap-down inertial navigation system (SINS) with large initial misalignment angles, this paper develops its multiplicative quaternion error model. With the faults analysis of traditional quaternion mean calculation methods, it developed its new calculation method in which the attitude matrix cost function was constructed to calculate its maximum eigenvalues, and it selected the eigenvector which correspond to the maximum eigenvalue as the predicted quaternion mean to guarantee its unit normalization and the sign invariability when the sign of calculating quaternion changed. The multiplicative quaternion error representing the distance between quaternion Sigma-points and the predicted mean quaternion calculated the quaternion prediction error variance matrix, and which can effectively overcome the application limits for SPKF algorithms in quaternion filtering implementation. Combined with the central divided difference filtering (CDKF) algorithm which belongs to SPKF algorithms, it proposed a new quaternion CDKF algorithm (QCDKF) for quaternion filtering problems. With large initial misalignment angles and based on QCDKF algorithm the SINS simulation experiments was being performed. The simulations results show that, compared with EKF algorithm, the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the filtering precision of both attitude misalignment angles estimation errors and velocity estimation errors and the numerical calculation stabilization of the filtering algorithm. ©2010 IEEE.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60092439","afid":"60092439","affilname":"Zhengzhoug University of Light Industry","affiliation-city":"Zhengzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003353","afid":"60003353","affilname":"Harbin Engineering University","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/22533261500","authid":"22533261500","authname":"Zhou W.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Weidong","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003353"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35069149600","authid":"35069149600","authname":"Ding G.","surname":"Ding","given-name":"Guoqiang","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003353"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60092439"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56547540900","authid":"56547540900","authname":"Hao Y.","surname":"Hao","given-name":"Yanling","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003353"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14831016900","authid":"14831016900","authname":"Cui G.","surname":"Cui","given-name":"Guangzhao","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60092439"}]}],"authkeywords":"Initial alignment | Multiplicative quaternion error | Quaternion central divided difference filtering | SINS","article-number":"5512239","source-id":"19700177041","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/78651537343"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/78651537343?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=78651537343&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=78651537343&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/78651537343","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:78651537343","eid":"2-s2.0-78651537343","dc:title":"Interactive dimensional synthesis and motion design of planar 6R single-loop closed chains via constraint manifold modification","dc:creator":"Wu J.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Mechanisms and Robotics","prism:issn":"19424302","prism:eIssn":"19424310","prism:volume":"2","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2010-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"August 2010","prism:doi":"10.1115/1.4001775","dc:description":"In this paper, we present an interactive, visual design approach for the dimensional synthesis of planar 6R single-loop closed chains for a given rational motion using constraint manifold modification. This approach is implemented in an interactive software tool that provides mechanism designers with an intuitive way to determine the parameters of planar mechanisms, and in the process equips them with an understanding of the design process. The theoretical foundation of this work is based on representing planar displacements with planar quaternions, which can be seen as points in a special higher dimensional projective space (called the image space), and on formulating the kinematic constraints of closed chains as algebraic surfaces in the image space. Kinematic constraints under consideration limit the positions and orientation of the coupler in its workspace. In this way, a given motion of a mechanism in the Cartesian space maps to a curve in the image space that is limited to stay within the bounds of the algebraic surfaces. Thus, the problem of dimensional synthesis is reduced to determine the parameters of equations that describe algebraic surfaces. We show that the interactive approach presented here is general in nature, and can be easily used for the dimensional synthesis of any mechanism for which kinematic constraints can be expressed algebraically. The process of designing is fast, intuitive, and especially useful when a numerical optimization based approach would be computationally demanding and mathematically difficult to formulate. This simple approach also provides a basis for students and early designers to learn and understand the process of mechanism design by simple geometric manipulations. © 2010 by ASME.","citedby-count":"39","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026415","afid":"60026415","affilname":"Stony Brook University","affiliation-city":"Stony Brook","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55865237400","authid":"55865237400","authname":"Wu J.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Jun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026415"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16068884300","authid":"16068884300","authname":"Purwar A.","surname":"Purwar","given-name":"Anurag","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026415"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101922139","authid":"7101922139","authname":"Ge Q.J.","surname":"Ge","given-name":"Q.

It is valuable to make a thorough study of quaternion from a mathematical point of view. However, due to the non-commutative nature, quaternion algebra is not so easy to handle as people expected. One of the methods to deal with quaternions is to identify them with real matrices, the entries of which are of course commutative. These identifications are actually embeddings from quaternion algebra to Rn×n. The current method investigated the algebraic embedding problem from the quaternion algebra to Rn×n, and found out all the possible algebraic embeddings under the condition that maps the imaginary units to signed permutation matrices. The method is to consider the images of the generators (i.e. the imaginary units) of quaternion algebra., then investigated the properties of these images and determined what kind of real matrices fulfilled them. Next, it solved the problem by invoking the language of group action. The conclusion turns out to be interesting: the crucial pairs of matrices, which determine the embeddings, are made up of real matrix pairs and there are essentially two pairs of the latter kind.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024350","afid":"60024350","affilname":"National University of Defense Technology China","affiliation-city":"Changsha","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"re","subtypeDescription":"Review","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36612474300","authid":"36612474300","authname":"Wang B.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Bu Liao","initials":"B.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401762082","authid":"7401762082","authname":"Feng L.","surname":"Feng","given-name":"Liang Gui","initials":"L.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024350"}]}],"authkeywords":"Quaternion | Real matrix | Representation","source-id":"14644","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77954698573"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77954698573?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77954698573&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77954698573&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77954698573","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:77954698573","eid":"2-s2.0-77954698573","dc:title":"Adaptive color feature extraction based on image color distributions","dc:creator":"Chen W.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","prism:issn":"10577149","prism:volume":"19","prism:issueIdentifier":"8","prism:pageRange":"2005-2016","prism:coverDate":"2010-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"August 2010","prism:doi":"10.1109/TIP.2010.2051753","dc:description":"This paper proposes an adaptive color feature extraction scheme by considering the color distribution of an image. Based on the binary quaternion-moment-preserving (BQMP) thresholding technique, the proposed extraction methods, fixed cardinality (FC) and variable cardinality (VC), are able to extract color features by preserving the color distribution of an image up to the third moment and to substantially reduce the distortion incurred in the extraction process. In addition to utilizing the earth mover's distance (EMD) as the distance measure of our color features, we also devise an efficient and effective distance measure, comparing histograms by clustering (CHIC). Moreover, the efficient implementation of our extraction methods is explored. With slight modification of the BQMP algorithm, our extraction methods are equipped with the capability of exploiting the concurrent property of hardware implementation. The experimental results show that our hardware implementation can achieve approximately a second order of magnitude improvement over the software implementation. It is noted that minimizing the distortion incurred in the extraction process can enhance the accuracy of the subsequent various image applications, and we evaluate the meaningfulness of the new extraction methods by the application to content-based image retrieval (CBIR).

Strong crest points derived from principal curvatures provide the most robust features for image registration. Crest point strengths are based on their principal curvatures and the number of scales a particular crest point is detected at. Geometric features are extracted which are invariant to rotation, translation and scaling by using neighborhood crest points only as other voxels are susceptible to deformation. The neighborhood size is adjusted according to scale adaptively using a fixed k nearest neighbor to make the extracted feature scale invariant. Statistical properties are used to measure the distribution of these geometric invariant features. The scale and rotation invariant feature points are then used to establish a point to point correspondence between the template crest points and the subject image crest points. A multi-scale feature based subdivision scheme is employed for registration where a weighted quaternion matrix provides a quaternion transformation based on the corresponding points to obtain the best rotation for global as well as local sub-blocks. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60078616","afid":"60078616","affilname":"School of Computer Science and Engineering","affiliation-city":"Singapore City","affiliation-country":"Singapore"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002668","afid":"60002668","affilname":"A-Star, Institute for Infocomm Research","affiliation-city":"Singapore City","affiliation-country":"Singapore"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35809706000","authid":"35809706000","authname":"Ahmad F.H.","surname":"Ahmad","given-name":"Fahad Hameed","initials":"F.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60078616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57614377800","authid":"57614377800","authname":"Natarajan S.","surname":"Natarajan","given-name":"Sudha","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60078616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23389932700","authid":"23389932700","authname":"Jiang J.L.","surname":"Jiang","given-name":"Jimmy Liu","initials":"J.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002668"}]}],"source-id":"25674","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77954420716"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77954420716?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77954420716&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77954420716&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77954420716","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:77954420716","eid":"2-s2.0-77954420716","dc:title":"A multidimensional approach to postural sway modeling","dc:creator":"Bravi A.","prism:publicationName":"2010 IEEE International Workshop on Medical Measurements and Applications, MeMeA 2010 - Proceedings","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781424462896"}],"prism:pageRange":"121-124","prism:coverDate":"2010-07-14","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2010","prism:doi":"10.1109/MEMEA.2010.5480228","dc:description":"This paper deals with the investigation of interesting analytical properties of the bidimensional fluctuations of the center of pressure (COP) during static posturographic tests (postural sway), namely their complex-valued and non-circular nature.

The signal output model based on quaternion was set for electromagnetic sensor. Based on the quaternion model, only DOA parameters rather than polarization parameters exist in the direction matrix. Thus, the high-dimensional searching process is replaced by the low-dimensional process in the proposed DOA estimation algorithm so that the amount of computation is heavily reduced.

This approach is implemented in an interactive software tool that provides mechanism designers with an intuitive way to determine the dimensional parameters of planar mechanisms, and in the process equips them with an understanding of the design process. The theoretical foundation of this work is based on representing planar displacements with planar quaternions which can be seen as points in a special higher dimensional projective space (called the image space), and on formulating the kinematic constraints of closed chains as algebraic surfaces in the image space. Kinematic constraints under consideration limit the positions and orientation of the coupler in its workspace. In this way, a given motion of a mechanism in the Cartesian space maps to a curve in the image space that has to stay within the bounds of the algebraic surfaces. Thus, the problem of dimensional synthesis is reduced to determining parameters of equations that describe algebraic surfaces. This paper is an extension of our previous work in which we had presented some preliminary results based on an optimization method. We show that the interactive approach presented here is general in nature, and can be easily used for the dimensional synthesis of any mechanism for which kinematic constraints can be expressed algebraically. The process of designing is fast, intuitive, and especially useful when an optimization based approach would be computationally demanding, and mathematically difficult to formulate. This simple approach also provides a basis for students and early designers to learn and understand the process of mechanism design by simple geometric manipulations.

To reduce the number of injuries and fatalities through vehicle design improvements, it is important to study occupant kinematics and related injury mechanisms during crashes. Occupant motion in crash tests is typically measured with high speed video, spatial scanning, direct field sensing, and inertial sensing. In this work, we present simulation and testing results on inertial sensing of dummy kinematics based on a novel algorithm known as Quaternion Fuzzy Logic Adaptive Signal Processing for Biomechanics (QFLASP-B). This approach uses three angular rates and three accelerations (one gyroscope-accelerometer pair about each axis) per rigid body to compute orientations (roll, pitch and yaw), positions and velocities in the inertial (fixed) reference frame. In QFLASP-B, quaternion errors and gyro biases are calculated and used in an adaptive loop to remove their effects. The Fuzzy Estimator at the core of the algorithm consists of a fuzzification process, an inference mechanism, a Rule Base and a defuzzification process. In this paper, we examine those aspects of the QFLASP-B Fuzzy Estimator critical to accurate kinematics sensing, hardware and software implementations and experimental results compared with traditional approaches.

Using quaternion multipliers as essential building blocks, computational schemes for both critically sampled and oversampled systems, including those with pairwise-mirror-image (PMI) symmetric responses, have been made inherently lossless at the cost of extra operations. Compared to the known dyadic-based solution of this sort, which consists in norm equalization using double-precision scalings, the proposed structures are characterized by similar complexity but are more consistent in terms of wordlength. Additionally, one-regularity (zero DC leakage) constraints can be formulated in terms of hypercomplex coefficients, so that they can be used in the discrete domain, unlike the known method of constraining rotation angles, and an arbitrary stage can be constrained, not only the initial one, as in the known dyadic/lifting-based approach. Even though the quaternion approach is not as general as the mentioned ones, 8-channel systems it applies to are of primary importance in image processing. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We know that the mesh as hurdle can be made less irritating by either moving the camera or the source itself. The method uses Radon Transform for extracting the mesh lines and capturing the position of the mesh lines. The final process of filling the deformed image is through the registration. The method is adaptive to movement in any direction. Quaternion method is used to remove the scaling and rotational errors. It was tested on a number of images approximately and gave excellent results.
