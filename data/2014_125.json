This paper proposes a new approach for driver's head pose estimation. With a stereo camera mounted in a realistic position on top of the center stack the system continuously tracks the orientation of the driver's head in realtime (25fps) using solely 3-D information. The systems processing chain comprises separate modules for head separation, pose estimation and pose tracking. Head separation employes a Bayesian modeling approach for robust head-torso separation. The pose estimation module uses Synchronized Submanifold Embedding (SSE), a nonlinear regression method, which includes a dimensionality reduction, a k-nearest neighbor search and a barycentric coordinate estimation. The tracking module estimates angular velocity of the head, using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in quaternion space. Comprehensive experiments show, that the proposed system achieves high accuracy from a non-central camera position. Since the approach does not rely on facial feature points the system handles large pose variations and is not disturbed by (sun)glasses. © 2014 IEEE.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60085149","afid":"60085149","affilname":"Daimler AG","affiliation-city":"Stuttgart","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030040","afid":"60030040","affilname":"Technischen Universität Ilmenau","affiliation-city":"Ilmenau","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010586","afid":"60010586","affilname":"Universität Ulm","affiliation-city":"Ulm","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35147786200","authid":"35147786200","authname":"Hoffken M.","surname":"Hoffken","given-name":"Matthias","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010586"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56307946400","authid":"56307946400","authname":"Tarayan E.","surname":"Tarayan","given-name":"Emin","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030040"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602794359","authid":"6602794359","authname":"Kresel U.","surname":"Kresel","given-name":"Ulrich","initials":"U.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60085149"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602970323","authid":"6602970323","authname":"Dietmayer K.","surname":"Dietmayer","given-name":"Klaus","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010586"}]}],"article-number":"6856578","source-id":"70642","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84905286528"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84905286528?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84905286528&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84905286528&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84905286528","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84905286528","eid":"2-s2.0-84905286528","dc:title":"A unique polar representation of the hyperanalytic signal","dc:creator":"Huang B.","prism:publicationName":"ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - Proceedings","prism:issn":"15206149","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781479928927"}],"prism:pageRange":"379-383","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2014","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6853622","dc:description":"The hyperanalytic signal is the straight forward generalization of the classical analytic signal.

However, the exploited sparse representation models deal with the color images as independent channel planes. Consequently, these approaches process the color pixels as scalar quantity, lacking of accuracy in describing inter-relationship among color channels. In this paper, we propose a quaternion-based online dictionary learning method and solve color image super-resolution by employing a quaternion-based sparse representation model. This sparse representation model implements color image superresolution in a kind of vectorial reconstruction, effectively accounting for both luminance and chrominance geometry in images. The proposed color image super-resolution method can better describe the inter-channel changes. In the case that changing lighting conditions affect color more than the luminance perception, it can obtain superior performance comparing to the methods based on monochromatic sparse models with 1dB improvement. © 2014 IEEE.","citedby-count":"18","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025084","afid":"60025084","affilname":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114554120","afid":"114554120","affilname":"Shanghai Key Lab of Digital Media Processing and Transmations","affiliation-city":null,"affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56303733900","authid":"56303733900","authname":"Yu M.","surname":"Yu","given-name":"Mengqi","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"114554120"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55695017800","authid":"55695017800","authname":"Xu Y.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Yi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"114554120"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57198701311","authid":"57198701311","authname":"Sun P.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Peng","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"114554120"}]}],"authkeywords":"dictionary learning | OMP | PCA | Quaternion | sparse representation | super-resolution","article-number":"6854716","source-id":"110544","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84905248153"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84905248153?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84905248153&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84905248153&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84905248153","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84905248153","eid":"2-s2.0-84905248153","dc:title":"Robust perceptual color image hashing using quaternion singular value decomposition","dc:creator":"Ghouti L.","prism:publicationName":"ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - Proceedings","prism:issn":"15206149","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781479928927"}],"prism:pageRange":"3794-3798","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2014","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854311","dc:description":"Perceptual hashing provides compact and efficient representations for image retrieval, authentication and tamper detection applications. However, most of existing perceptual hashing algorithms are designed for gray-level images and, therefore, color correlation and interaction are simply ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel perceptual hashing for color images using the quaternion singular value decomposition (Q-SVD). In this algorithm, color images are processed through randomized dimensionality reduction which results in secure and robust hashing codes. The motivation behind our work is twofold: 1) a compact representation of color images where the red, green and blue (RGB) components are handled as a single entity using hypercomplex representations and 2) the ability of Q-SVD decomposition to provide the best low-rank approximation of quaternion matrices in the sense of Frobenius norm. Possible geometric attacks are properly modeled as an independent and identically-distributed hypercomplex noise on the singular vectors. Such modeling simplifies the hash code detector design. Finally, the hashing robustness against geometric attacks is evaluated over a large set of standard test images using the receiver operating characteristics analysis. The proposed scheme outperforms SVD-based hashing algorithms in terms of lower miss and false alarm probabilities by orders of magnitude. © 2014 IEEE.","citedby-count":"37","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009506","afid":"60009506","affilname":"King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals","affiliation-city":"Dhahran","affiliation-country":"Saudi Arabia"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12796039800","authid":"12796039800","authname":"Ghouti L.","surname":"Ghouti","given-name":"Lahouari","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009506"}]}],"article-number":"6854311","source-id":"110544","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84905230296"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84905230296?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84905230296&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84905230296&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84905230296","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84905230296","eid":"2-s2.0-84905230296","dc:title":"A Quaternion Least Mean Phase adaptive estimator","dc:creator":"Talebi S.P.","prism:publicationName":"ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - Proceedings","prism:issn":"15206149","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781479928927"}],"prism:pageRange":"6419-6423","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2014","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854840","dc:description":"A Quaternion Least Mean Phase (QLMP) algorithm is introduced for phase-only adaptive filtering of quaternion-valued signals.

Recently, several approaches were developed to process the color channels intrinsically, but they always cannot counterattack geometric distortions. It is a challenging work to design a robust color image watermarking scheme against geometrical distortions. In this paper, we propose a geometric correction based robust color image watermarking approach using quaternion Exponent moments (QEMs). The novelty of our approach is that (1) the QEMs are derived to deal with the color images in a holistic manner, and (2) the QEMs are exploited for estimating the geometric distortions parameters in order to permit watermark extraction. Experimental results confirm the validity of our approach and its higher robustness against geometrical distortions compared to alternative watermarking methods in the literature. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

First, based on the MN principle, the (M-N)×M dimension (M is the number of array sensors, N is the number of signal sources) orthogonal noise subspace vectors were converted to a 1×M dimension quaternion noise vector. Then, a simplified formula for peak search was proposed. The searching computation amount of Quaternion MN (Q-MN) was analyzed theoretically. Compared with the Q-MUSIC algorithm, the Q-MN algorithm can save at least 50% of the peak search volume. Experimental results show that the orthogonality of the steering vector with the low-dimensional noise vector derived by proposed method is superior to that with high dimensional noise subspace. When the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) is 0 dB, the Vandermonde norm and the spatial spectrum peak value of Q-MN algorithm are 1/3 times and 3 times as much as those of Q-MUSIC. The Q-MN algorithm can successfully identify the DOA of signal sources, and its resolution is equivalent to that of Q-MUSIC algorithm. Moreover, it can be applied to not only L-shaped arrays, but also plane arrays and parallel linear arrays.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007711","afid":"60007711","affilname":"Jilin University","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35770876900","authid":"35770876900","authname":"Li X.B.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Xin Bo","initials":"X.B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192493691","authid":"57192493691","authname":"Li X.Q.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Xiao Qing","initials":"X.Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56510414200","authid":"56510414200","authname":"Liu G.J.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Guo Jun","initials":"G.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404964763","authid":"7404964763","authname":"Shi Y.W.","surname":"Shi","given-name":"Yao Wu","initials":"Y.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57044906100","authid":"57044906100","authname":"Yang Z.G.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Zhi Gang","initials":"Z.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]}],"authkeywords":"Acoustic vector sensor | Direction of Arrival (DOA) | Min-norm algorithm | Parameter estimation | Quaternion","source-id":"144897","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84904818109"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84904818109?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84904818109&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84904818109&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84904818109","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84904818109","eid":"2-s2.0-84904818109","dc:title":"Quaternionic signal processing techniques for automatic evaluation of dance performances from MoCap data","dc:creator":"Alexiadis D.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","prism:issn":"15209210","prism:volume":"16","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"1391-1406","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"August 2014","prism:doi":"10.1109/TMM.2014.2317311","dc:description":"In this paper, the problem of automatic dance performance evaluation from human Motion Capture (MoCap) data is addressed. A novel framework is presented, using data captured by Kinect-based human skeleton tracking, where the evaluation of user's performance is achieved against a gold-standard performance of a teacher. The framework addresses several technical challenges, including global and local temporal synchronization, spatial alignment and comparison of two 'dance motion signals.' Towards the solution of these technical challenges, a set of appropriate quaternionic vector-signal processing methodologies is proposed, where the 4D (spatiotemporal) human motion data are represented as sequences of pure quaternions. Such a quaternionic representation offers several advantages, including the facts that joint angles and rotations are inherently encoded in the phase of quaternions and the three coordinates variables (X,Y,Z) are treated jointly, with their intra-correlations being taken into account. Based on the theory of quaternions, a number of advantageous algorithms are formulated. Initially, global temporal synchronization of dance MoCap data is achieved by the use of quaternionic cross-correlations, which are invariant to rigid spatial transformations between the users. Secondly, a quaternions-based algorithm is proposed for the fast spatial alignment of dance MoCap data. Thirdly, the MoCap data can be temporally synchronized in a local fashion, using Dynamic Time Warping techniques adapted to the specific problem. Finally, a set of quaternionic correlation-based measures (scores) are proposed for evaluating and ranking the performance of a dancer. These quaternions-based scores are invariant to rigid transformations, as proved and demonstrated. A total score metric, through a weighted combination of three different metrics is proposed, where the weights are optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The presented experimental results using the Huawei/3DLife/EMC2 dataset are promising and verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods. © 1999-2012 IEEE.","citedby-count":"41","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026208","afid":"60026208","affilname":"Centre for Research and Technology-Hellas","affiliation-city":"Thessaloniki","affiliation-country":"Greece"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16030176800","authid":"16030176800","authname":"Alexiadis D.","surname":"Alexiadis","given-name":"Dimitrios S.","initials":"D.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026208"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602644373","authid":"6602644373","authname":"Daras P.","surname":"Daras","given-name":"Petros","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026208"}]}],"authkeywords":"Dance analysis | motion capture data | quaternions | skeleton tracking | vector signal processing","article-number":"6797927","source-id":"16211","fund-no":"FP7601170","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84904561495"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84904561495?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84904561495&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84904561495&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84904561495","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84904561495","eid":"2-s2.0-84904561495","dc:title":"Digital fingerprinting based on quaternion encryption scheme for gray-tone images","dc:creator":"Czaplewski B.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Telecommunications and Information Technology","prism:issn":"15094553","prism:eIssn":"18998852","prism:volume":"2014","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"3-11","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2014","dc:description":"In this paper a new idea of digital images finger-printing is proposed. The method is based on quaternion encryption in the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode. Quaternions are hyper-complex numbers of rank 4 and thus often applied to mechanics in three-dimensional space. The encryption algorithm described in the paper is designed for graytone images but can easily be adopted for color ones. For the encryption purpose, the algorithm uses the rotation of data vectors presented as quaternions in a three-dimensional space around another quaternion (key). On the receiver's side, a small amount of unnoticeable by human eye errors occurs in the decrypted images. These errors are used as a user's digital fingerprint for the purpose of traitor tracing in case of copyright violation. A computer-based simulation was performed to scrutinize the potential presented quaternion encryption scheme for the implementation of digital fingerprinting.

In particular, the following techniques are investigated: anisotropic interpolation operating on scalar gray-level images, log-Euclidean interpolation method, and the quaternion interpolation method, which operate on diffusion tensor fields. The performance is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively using criteria such as tensor determinant, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), fiber length, etc. We conclude that tensor field interpolations allow avoiding undesirable swelling effect in DTI, which is not the case with scalar gray-level interpolation, and that scalar gray-level image interpolation and log-Euclidean tensor field interpolation suffer from decrease in FA and MD, which may mislead the interpretation of the clinical parameters FA and MD. In contrast, the quaternion tensor field interpolation avoids such FA and MD decrease, which suggests its use for clinical applications. © 2014 IEEE.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025084","afid":"60025084","affilname":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022381","afid":"60022381","affilname":"Beijing Jiaotong University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016253","afid":"60016253","affilname":"INSA Lyon","affiliation-city":"Villeurbanne","affiliation-country":"France"}],"pubmed-id":"25014936","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56408792200","authid":"56408792200","authname":"Yang F.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Feng","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022381"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55629946300","authid":"55629946300","authname":"Zhu Y.M.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Yue Min","initials":"Y.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016253"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8698697600","authid":"8698697600","authname":"Luo J.H.","surname":"Luo","given-name":"Jian Hua","initials":"J.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603301837","authid":"6603301837","authname":"Robini M.","surname":"Robini","given-name":"Marc","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016253"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56191349100","authid":"56191349100","authname":"Liu J.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Jie","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022381"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56090654400","authid":"56090654400","authname":"Croisille P.","surname":"Croisille","given-name":"Pierre","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016253"}]}],"authkeywords":"Diffusion tensor imaging | diffusion-weighted (DW) image | fiber tractography | interpolation | magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) | tensor field interpolation","article-number":"6744597","source-id":"21100256982","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84904127056"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84904127056?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84904127056&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84904127056&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84904127056","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84904127056","eid":"2-s2.0-84904127056","dc:title":"6DOF wireless tracking wand using MARG and vision sensor fusion","dc:creator":"Chintalapalli H.","prism:publicationName":"International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks","prism:issn":"15501329","prism:eIssn":"15501477","prism:volume":"2014","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2014","prism:doi":"10.1155/2014/864768","dc:description":"We present a low cost battery-powered 6-degree-of-freedom wireless wand for 3D modeling in free space by tri-axis Magnetic, Angular Rate, Gravity (MARG) and vision sensor fusion. Our approach has two stages of sensor fusion, each with different algorithms for finding 3D orientation and position. The first stage fusion algorithm, a complementary filter, utilizes MARG sensors to compute 3D orientation relative to the direction of gravity and earth's magnetic field in a quaternion format, which was adjusted with compensations for magnetic distortion. The second stage fusion algorithm, a Kalman filter, utilizes accelerometer data and IR marker velocity to compute 3D position. In order to compute the IR marker linear velocity along the optical axis (the z-axis), we present a simple and efficient image-based technique to find the distance of the object from the camera using blob area pixels in the image. Our fusion (inside-in and outside-in) approach efficiently solves short time occlusion, needs of frequent calibration, and unbounded drift problems involved in numerical integration of inertial sensors data and improves the degrees of freedom at low cost without compromising accuracy.

In this method, the attitude quaternion is used as sampling particles for the particle filter and the niche genetic algorithm (NGA) is introduced into the particle filter algorithm in order to improve its performance. At the same time, gyro bias is estimated by the genetic algorithm separately to reduce the state dimension of the particle filter. This method not only maintains the properties of the normalized quaternion but also solves the particle degradation problem in the resampling stage by introducing the NGA. And as gyro bias is estimated separately, the expansion of the state dimension is avoided. The method can achieve attitude determination with high efficiency and precision for the case of relatively few particles. Simulation results show the validity of the method.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073727","afid":"60073727","affilname":"Naval Aeronautical Engineering Academy Yantai","affiliation-city":"Yantai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/51663941000","authid":"51663941000","authname":"Li H.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Haijun","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073727"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/18234452000","authid":"18234452000","authname":"Zhao G.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Guorong","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073727"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55571491500","authid":"55571491500","authname":"Huang J.","surname":"Huang","given-name":"Jingli","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073727"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56069579400","authid":"56069579400","authname":"Zhou D.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Dawang","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073727"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude estimation | Gyro bias estimation | Niche genetic algorithm | Nonlinear filtering | Particle filter | Quaternion","source-id":"29006","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84903697238"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84903697238?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84903697238&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84903697238&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84903697238","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84903697238","eid":"2-s2.0-84903697238","dc:title":"Unsupervised color image segmentation using two-phase graph cuts with multiple components","dc:creator":"Dong Z.","prism:publicationName":"Zidonghua Xuebao/Acta Automatica Sinica","prism:issn":"02544156","prism:volume":"40","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"1223-1232","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2014","prism:doi":"10.3724/SP.J.1004.2014.01223","dc:description":"A color image segmentation method based on multi-component graph cuts and a two-level Gaussian pyramid is proposed to address the problems of over-segmentation and lower efficiency caused by noise and large number of labels. When using multi-component graph cuts to segment an image, regions with the same label are handled as the multiple components of the corresponding segment. In order to reduce the number of labels and segmentation errors, the proposed method integrates multi-component graph cuts with a two-level Gaussian pyramid, called two-phase multi-component graph cuts, which can improve the performance of segmentation. Improved multi-scale quaternion Gabor filter based texton texture features are first extracted and adaptively fused with color features, then the two-phase multi-component graph cut technique is used to get optimized segmentation, where the gradient of the image is used to compute the smoothness term to guide graph cuts to the optimum. Finally, the segmentation result is obtained after removing some weak edges from the optimized result with the proposed method.

The weight vector update of CQLMS algorithm is derived based on the complex gradient, leading to lower computational complexity. Because the complex quaternion can exhibit the orthogonal structure of an electromagnetic vector-sensor in a natural way, a complex quaternion model in time domain is provided for a 3-component vector-sensor array.

Hence, the saliency map synthetically reflects the differences of luminance, saturation and hue components of the color image. Finally, the saliency map is used to enhance the luminance.

Algorithms for computing the Riemannian Lp center of mass of a set of points, with 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ (i.e., median, mean, Lp barycenter and minimax center), are particularized to the case of ℍ*. Two different approaches are considered. The first formulation is based on computing the logarithm of quaternions which maps them to the Euclidean tangent space at identity 1, associated to the Lie algebra of ℍ*. In the tangent space, Euclidean algorithms for Lp center of mass can be naturally applied. The second formulation is a family of methods based on gradient descent algorithms aiming at minimizing the sum of quaternion geodesic distances raised to power p. These algorithms converges to the quaternion Fréchet-Karcher barycenter (p = 2), the quaternion Fermat-Weber point (p = 1) and the quaternion Riemannian 1-center (p = +∞). Besides giving explicit forms of these algorithms, their application for quaternion image processing is shown by introducing the notion of quaternion bilateral filtering. © 2013 Springer Basel.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030506","afid":"60030506","affilname":"Mines Paris - PSL","affiliation-city":"Paris","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102728753","authid":"7102728753","authname":"Angulo J.","surname":"Angulo","given-name":"Jesús","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030506"}]}],"authkeywords":"Fréchet-Karcher barycenter | Lie group of nonzero quaternions | Log-Euclidean quaternion mean | quaternion averaging | Riemannian center-of-mass","source-id":"4900152804","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84901979018"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84901979018?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84901979018&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84901979018&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84901979018","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84901979018","eid":"2-s2.0-84901979018","dc:title":"Two-Sided Clifford Fourier Transform with Two Square Roots of -1 in Cl(p, q)","dc:creator":"Hitzer E.","prism:publicationName":"Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras","prism:issn":"01887009","prism:eIssn":"16614909","prism:volume":"24","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"313-332","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2014","prism:doi":"10.1007/s00006-014-0441-9","dc:description":"We generalize quaternion and Clifford Fourier transforms to general two-sided Clifford Fourier transforms (CFT), and study their properties (from linearity to convolution).

We propose a new pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR)-based navigation algorithm by using magnetic, angular rate, and gravity (MARG) sensors which are equipped in existing commercial smartphone. Our proposed navigation algorithm consists of step detection, stride length estimation, and heading estimation. To eliminate the gauge step errors of the random bouncing motions, we designed a reliable algorithm for step detection. We developed a BP neural network-based stride length estimation algorithm to apply to different users. In response to the challenge of magnetic disturbance, a quaternion-based extended Kalman filter (EKF) is introduced to determine the user's heading direction for each step. The performance of our proposed pedestrian navigation algorithm is verified by using a smartphone in providing accurate, reliable, and continuous location tracking services. © 2014 Tian et al.; licensee Springer.","citedby-count":"94","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020620","afid":"60020620","affilname":"Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55506175400","authid":"55506175400","authname":"Tian Z.","surname":"Tian","given-name":"Zengshan","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56193373600","authid":"56193373600","authname":"Zhang Y.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Yuan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55506126300","authid":"55506126300","authname":"Zhou M.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Mu","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55742034900","authid":"55742034900","authname":"Liu Y.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Yu","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]}],"authkeywords":"Dead reckoning | Localization | MARG sensors | Pedestrian navigation | Smartphone","article-number":"65","source-id":"15300154801","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"A2012-33","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84901418321"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84901418321?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84901418321&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84901418321&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84901418321","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84901418321","eid":"2-s2.0-84901418321","dc:title":"Improving the geolocation algorithm for sensors onboard the ISS: Effect of drift angle","dc:creator":"Dou C.","prism:publicationName":"Remote Sensing","prism:eIssn":"20724292","prism:volume":"6","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"4647-4659","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2014","prism:doi":"10.3390/rs6064647","dc:description":"The drift angle caused by the Earth's self-rotation may introduce rotational displacement artifact on the geolocation results of imagery acquired by an Earth observing sensor onboard the International Space Station (ISS). If uncorrected, it would cause a gradual degradation of positional accuracy from the center towards the edges of an image. One correction method to account for the drift angle effect was developed. The drift angle was calculated from the ISS state vectors and positional information of the ground nadir point of the imagery. Tests with images acquired by the International Space Station Agriculture Camera (ISSAC) using Google Earth™ as a reference indicated that applying the drift angle correction can reduce the residual geolocation error for the corner points of the ISSAC images from over 1000 to less than 500 m. The improved geolocation accuracy is well within the inherent geolocation uncertainty of up to 800 m, mainly due to imprecise knowledge of the ISS attitude and state parameters required to perform the geolocation algorithm. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60083505","afid":"60083505","affilname":"Binzhou University","affiliation-city":"Binzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027363","afid":"60027363","affilname":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026161","afid":"60026161","affilname":"University of North Dakota","affiliation-city":"Grand Forks","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019499","afid":"60019499","affilname":"Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/47561145300","authid":"47561145300","authname":"Dou C.","surname":"Dou","given-name":"Changyong","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019499"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56676968200","authid":"56676968200","authname":"Zhang X.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xiaodong","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026161"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56415384100","authid":"56415384100","authname":"Guo H.","surname":"Guo","given-name":"Huadong","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019499"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56498283700","authid":"56498283700","authname":"Han C.","surname":"Han","given-name":"Chunming","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019499"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56894773400","authid":"56894773400","authname":"Liu M.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Ming","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60083505"}]}],"authkeywords":"Drift angle | Geolocation | ISS | ISSAC | Unit quaternion","source-id":"86430","fund-acr":"NSF","fund-no":"0814442","fund-sponsor":"National Science Foundation","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}}]}}
