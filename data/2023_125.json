Disturbance components such as external acceleration and magnetic disturbance in the sensor signal deteriorate the estimation accuracy. While conventional filters such as Kalman filters and complementary filters successfully deal with these issues, there are still much room to improve the estimation performance. One alternative approach involves training an end-to-end neural network (NN) using raw IMMU datasets based on ground truth measurements. In this study, we propose an end-to-end NN to estimate a 3D orientation over time without an additional conventional filter. The architecture of the proposed NN comprises two separate recurrent NNs in a parallel configuration. The proposed parallel network can independently estimate two vectors, corresponding to the attitude and heading, and then combine the two vectors to form a direction cosine matrix (DCM) that represents the 3D orientation. The proposed DCM-based NN has been experimentally verified under various disturbance conditions. The orientation estimation accuracy of the proposed method was superior to those of the conventional filters as well as that of the quaternion-based NN.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073748","afid":"60073748","affilname":"Hankyong National University","affiliation-city":"Anseong","affiliation-country":"South Korea"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57445391900","authid":"57445391900","authname":"Choi J.S.","surname":"Choi","given-name":"Ji Seok","initials":"J.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073748"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219201206","authid":"57219201206","authname":"Lee C.J.","surname":"Lee","given-name":"Chang June","initials":"C.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073748"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58525333200","authid":"58525333200","authname":"Lee J.K.","surname":"Lee","given-name":"Jung Keun","initials":"J.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073748"}]}],"authkeywords":"3D orientation estimation | Biological neural networks | Direction cosine matrix | Estimation | inertial and magnetic sensor | Magnetic separation | Navigation | Neural networks | recurrent neural network | Recurrent neural networks | Three-dimensional displays | Training","source-id":"21100374601","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85168415136"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85168415136?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85168415136&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85168415136&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85168415136","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85168415136","eid":"2-s2.0-85168415136","dc:title":"Quaternion Interpolation Under the Angular Velocity Constraint","dc:creator":"Gokce M.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of 10th International Conference on Recent Advances in Air and Space Technologies, RAST 2023","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9798350323023"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1109/RAST57548.2023.10197985","dc:description":"In this paper we present a novel approach to interpolate the attitude.

The measurements are assumed to be made by some computer vision system (CVS). A specific type of СVS is not considered. It is supposed the CVS measures the distance and attitude of the so-called graphical reference frame rigidly fixed on the NSC. The parameters of relative motion include the distance vector to the center of mass (c.m.) of the NSC, the attitude quaternion of the principal inertia axes of the NSC relative to the CVS reference frame, the attitude quaternion of the graphical reference frame relative to the NSC principal reference frame, the ratio of the inertia moments, the position vector of the c.m. in the graphical reference frame. The problem is solved using a dynamic filter based on the ellipsoidal estimation method. The method implies knowledge of the maximum values of the measurement noise only, the stochastic noise characteristics are not assumed to be known and therefore are not used. The properties of the proposed algorithm have been demonstrated using numerical simulations. The results obtained are supposed to be used in the development, creation, and testing of a navigation system for the rendezvous and docking of a service spacecraft, developed by a group of enterprises in the space industry of Ukraine under the leadership of the Limited Liability Company “Kurs–Orbital”.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011313","afid":"60011313","affilname":"National Academy of Sciences in Ukraine","affiliation-city":"Kyiv","affiliation-country":"Ukraine"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6505955589","authid":"6505955589","orcid":"0000-0001-9810-0963","authname":"Salnikov N.N.","surname":"Salnikov","given-name":"N.

First a novel maximum total quaternion generalized correntropy (MTQGC) criterion is proposed to resist non-Gaussian noises. And the stochastic gradient method is used to implement the quaternion parameter estimation. Then, combined with the total least squares (TLS) method, an MTQGC algorithm is proposed using quaternion generalized Hamilton-real (GHR) calculus. Moreover, the convergence condition of the proposed MTQGC algorithm is obtained. Finally, simulations demonstrate the improved filtering performance in the QEIV model.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60122052","afid":"60122052","affilname":"Southwest University","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023380","afid":"60023380","affilname":"Chongqing University","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003030","afid":"60003030","affilname":"Chongqing Jiaotong University","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209805356","authid":"57209805356","authname":"Lin D.","surname":"Lin","given-name":"Dongyuan","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122052"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211914513","authid":"57211914513","authname":"Zhang Q.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Qiangqiang","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122052"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189664506","authid":"57189664506","authname":"Chen X.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Xiaofeng","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003030"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57092411800","authid":"57092411800","authname":"Qian J.","surname":"Qian","given-name":"Junhui","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023380"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55878634600","authid":"55878634600","authname":"Wang S.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Shiyuan","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122052"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptation models | Adaptive filters | Filtering | Integrated circuit modeling | Kernel | maximum total quaternion generalized correntropy | Quaternion adaptive filters | quaternion errors-in-variables model | Quaternions | robust method | Signal processing algorithms","source-id":"9500153930","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85168253179"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85168253179?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85168253179&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85168253179&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85168253179","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85168253179","eid":"2-s2.0-85168253179","dc:title":"Hypercomplex Multimodal Emotion Recognition from EEG and Peripheral Physiological Signals","dc:creator":"Lopez E.","prism:publicationName":"ICASSPW 2023 - 2023 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing Workshops, Proceedings","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9798350302615"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICASSPW59220.2023.10193329","dc:description":"Multimodal emotion recognition from physiological signals is receiving an increasing amount of attention due to the impossibility to control them at will unlike behavioral reactions, thus providing more reliable information. Existing deep learning-based methods still rely on extracted handcrafted features, not taking full advantage of the learning ability of neural networks, and often adopt a single-modality approach, while human emotions are inherently expressed in a multimodal way. In this paper, we propose a hypercomplex multimodal network equipped with a novel fusion module comprising parameterized hypercomplex multiplications. Indeed, by operating in a hypercomplex domain the operations follow algebraic rules which allow to model latent relations among learned feature dimensions for a more effective fusion step. We perform classification of valence and arousal from electroencephalogram (EEG) and peripheral physiological signals, employing the publicly available database MAHNOB-HCI surpassing a multimodal state-of-the-art network.

We show that all d-dimensional quaternion signals can be reconstructed up to a global right quaternion phase factor from <italic>O</italic>(<italic>d</italic>) phaseless measurements. We also develop the scalable algorithm quaternion Wirtinger flow (QWF) for solving QPR, and establish its linear convergence guarantee. Compared with the analysis of complex Wirtinger flow, a series of different treatments are employed to overcome the difficulties of the non-commutativity of quaternion multiplication. Moreover, we develop a variant of QWF that can effectively utilize a pure quaternion priori (e.g., for color images) by incorporating a quaternion phase factor estimate into QWF iterations. The estimate can be computed efficiently as it amounts to finding a singular vector of a 4 &#x00D7; 4 real matrix. Motivated by the variants of Wirtinger flow in prior work, we further propose quaternion truncated Wirtinger flow (QTWF), quaternion truncated amplitude flow (QTAF) and their pure quaternion versions. Experimental results on synthetic data and color images are presented to validate our theoretical results. In particular, for pure quaternion signal recovery, our quaternion method often succeeds with notably fewer measurements compared to real-valued methods based on monochromatic model or concatenation model.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006541","afid":"60006541","affilname":"The University of Hong Kong","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57271603700","authid":"57271603700","authname":"Chen J.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Junren","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006541"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34571761900","authid":"34571761900","authname":"Ng M.K.","surname":"Ng","given-name":"Michael K.","initials":"M.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006541"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color | Color Image Restoration | Extraterrestrial measurements | Image reconstruction | Nonconvex Optimization | Phase measurement | Phase Retrieval | Quaternion Signal Processing | Quaternions | Signal processing | Signal processing algorithms | Spectral Method","source-id":"17391","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherhybridgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Hybrid Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85166932004"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85166932004?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85166932004&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85166932004&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85166932004","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85166932004","eid":"2-s2.0-85166932004","dc:title":"Four-Dimensional Hurwitz Signal Constellations With Convenient Bit Mapping and Set Partitioning","dc:creator":"Stern S.","prism:publicationName":"WSA and SCC 2023 - 26th International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas and 13th Conference on Systems, Communications, and Coding","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783800760510"}],"prism:pageRange":"72-77","prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","dc:description":"The construction of four-dimensional (quaternionic) Voronoi-based signal constellations is considered for the application in dual-polarized transmission.

Based on a basisexpansion approach in which pairs of bits are jointly mapped to quaternion numbers, an isomorphism is established in which the addition of constellation points corresponds to the bit-wise addition (XOR) with carry in the corresponding bit labeling. Moreover, this basis expansion defines a set partitioning in which the minimum squared distance grows in every second bit level.

A pure quaternion matrix is acquired by performing the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the block division and the discrete cosine transform on the original color cover image. The quaternion matrix is operated by the QDFrAT to improve the robustness and the security of the watermarking scheme with the optimal transform angle and the fractional order. Then the singular value matrix is obtained by the quaternion singular value decomposition (QSVD) to further enhance the scheme’s stability. The encryption watermark is also processed by DWT and QSVD. Afterward, the singular value matrix of the encryption watermark is embedded into the singular value matrix of the host image by the optimal scaling factor.

However, the existing QSVD-based watermarking schemes face the obstacle of 'explosion of complexity' and have much room for improvement in terms of real-time, invisibility, and robustness. In this paper, we overcome such obstacle by introducing a new real structure-preserving QSVD algorithm and propose a novel QSVD-based watermarking scheme with high efficiency. Secret information is transmitted blindly by incorporating two new strategies: coefficient pair selection and adaptive embedding. The highly correlated coefficient pairs determined by the normalized cross-correlation method reduce the impact of embedding by reducing the maximum modification of the coefficient values, resulting in high fidelity of the watermarked image. Large-size 8-color binary watermark and QR code effectively verify that the proposed watermarking scheme can resist various image attacks in numerical experiments. Two keys designed by Logistic chaotic map ensure the security of the watermarking system. Under the premise of considering the correlation of color channels, the proposed watermarking scheme not only performs well in real-time and invisibility, but also has satisfactory advantages in robustness compared with the state-of-the-art methods.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023813","afid":"60023813","affilname":"Shanghai University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004691","afid":"60004691","affilname":"Jiangsu Normal University","affiliation-city":"Xuzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/129993682","afid":"129993682","affilname":"Research Institute of Mathematical Science","affiliation-city":"Jiangsu","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/125193984","afid":"125193984","affilname":"Research Institute of Usv Engineering","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"37440398","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216667311","authid":"57216667311","orcid":"0000-0002-9820-1614","authname":"Chen Y.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Yong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"125193984"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8264355300","authid":"8264355300","orcid":"0000-0001-9408-0942","authname":"Jia Z.","surname":"Jia","given-name":"Zhigang","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004691"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"129993682"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55962184600","authid":"55962184600","orcid":"0000-0002-2983-555X","authname":"Peng Y.","surname":"Peng","given-name":"Yaxin","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58488023900","authid":"58488023900","orcid":"0000-0003-1312-9527","authname":"Peng Y.","surname":"Peng","given-name":"Yan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"125193984"}]}],"authkeywords":"adaptive embedding | coefficient pair selection | QSVD | structure-preserving method","source-id":"25534","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"21KJA110001","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85164797105"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85164797105?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85164797105&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85164797105&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85164797105","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85164797105","eid":"2-s2.0-85164797105","dc:title":"Convolutional Filters and Neural Networks With Noncommutative Algebras","dc:creator":"Parada-Mayorga A.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","prism:issn":"1053587X","prism:eIssn":"19410476","prism:volume":"71","prism:pageRange":"2683-2698","prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1109/TSP.2023.3293716","dc:description":"In this paper we introduce and study the algebraic generalization of non commutative convolutional neural networks.

We develop the spectral representation of non commutative signal models to show that non commutative filters process Fourier components independently of each other. In particular we prove that although the spectral decompositions of signals in non commutative models are associated to eigenspaces of dimension larger than one, there exists a trade-off between stability and selectivity, which is controlled by matrix polynomial functions in spaces of matrices of low dimension. This tradeoff shows how when the filters in the algebra are restricted to be stable, there is a loss in discriminability that is compensated in the network by the pointwise nonlinearities.

They are suitable for processing 3-D features with fewer trainable free parameters than real-valued neural networks (RVNNs). This article proposes symbol detection in wireless polarization-shift-keying (PolSK) communications by employing QNNs. We demonstrate that quaternion plays a crucial role in the symbol detection of PolSK signals. Existing artificial-intelligence communication studies mainly focus on RVNN-based symbol detection in digital modulations having constellations in complex plane. However, in PolSK, information symbols are represented as the state of polarization, which can be mapped on the Poincare sphere and thus its symbols have a 3-D data structure. Quaternion algebra offers a unified representation to process 3-D data with rotational invariance and, therefore, it keeps the internal relationship among three components of a PolSK symbol. Hence, we can expect that QNNs learn the distribution of received symbols on the Poincare sphere with higher consistency to detect the transmitted symbols more efficiently than RVNNs. We compare PolSK symbol detection accuracy of two types of QNNs, RVNN, existing methods such as least-square and minimum-mean-square-error channel estimations, as well as detection knowing perfect channel state information (CSI). Simulation results including symbol error rate show that the proposed QNNs outperform the existing estimation methods and that they reach better results with two to three times fewer free parameters than the RVNN. We find that QNN processing will bring practical use of PolSK communications.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025272","afid":"60025272","affilname":"The University of Tokyo","affiliation-city":"Tokyo","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57789931000","authid":"57789931000","authname":"Chen H.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Haotian","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025272"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35795724100","authid":"35795724100","authname":"Natsuaki R.","surname":"Natsuaki","given-name":"Ryo","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025272"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35416951600","authid":"35416951600","authname":"Hirose A.","surname":"Hirose","given-name":"Akira","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025272"}]}],"authkeywords":"Channel estimation | Channel estimation | Fading channels | Modulation | Neural networks | polarization modulation | polarization shift keying (PolSK) | quaternion neural network (QNN) | Quaternions | symbol detection | Symbols | Wireless communication | wireless communications","source-id":"21100235616","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85164721223"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85164721223?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85164721223&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85164721223&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85164721223","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85164721223","eid":"2-s2.0-85164721223","dc:title":"Riemannian Quaternion Self-Organizing Map to Overcome Degree-of-Polarization Error in Polarimetric Ground-Penetrating Radar","dc:creator":"Song Y.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","prism:issn":"01962892","prism:eIssn":"15580644","prism:volume":"61","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2023.3293868","dc:description":"Ground-penetrating radar (GPR)-based landmine detection has advantages such as high safety and high efficiency. There are various methods to process the data obtained from GPR systems. One of the commonly used methods is to visualize the quaternion-type polarization data by quaternion self-organizing map (QSOM). However, QSOM cannot take into account the geometric property of the polarization data. Then, degree-of-polarization (DoP) error is introduced in the self-organization process of QSOM, which leads to unsatisfactory visualization results. To overcome the limitation, in this article, we propose a novel processing, Riemannian QSOM (RQSOM), which takes into account the geometric property to eliminate the DoP error with the help of logarithmic and exponential maps in Riemannian geometry. We analyze its basic dynamics and compare it with that of QSOM. We conduct experiments to visualize a mock plastic landmine with QSOM and RQSOM. The experimental results show that RQSOM realizes expected self-organization dynamics, thereby achieving better visualization results compared with QSOM.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025272","afid":"60025272","affilname":"The University of Tokyo","affiliation-city":"Tokyo","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222576222","authid":"57222576222","orcid":"0000-0002-2612-4859","authname":"Song Y.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Yicheng","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025272"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35795724100","authid":"35795724100","authname":"Natsuaki R.","surname":"Natsuaki","given-name":"Ryo","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025272"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35416951600","authid":"35416951600","orcid":"0000-0002-6936-9733","authname":"Hirose A.","surname":"Hirose","given-name":"Akira","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025272"}]}],"authkeywords":"Degree-of-polarization (DoP) error | Riemannian quaternion self-organizing map (RQSOM)","article-number":"4503911","source-id":"17360","fund-acr":"KAKEN","fund-no":"18H04105","fund-sponsor":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85164513589"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85164513589?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85164513589&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85164513589&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85164513589","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85164513589","eid":"2-s2.0-85164513589","dc:title":"AQPnP: an accurate and quaternion-based solution for the Perspective-n-Point problem","dc:creator":"Jahani S.","prism:publicationName":"Visual Computer","prism:issn":"01782789","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1007/s00371-023-02952-5","dc:description":"In this work, we present an accurate and quaternion-based solution for the Perspective-n-Point method for determining the position and orientation of a calibrated camera from a set of n 3D points and their corresponding 2D projections on the image plane referred to as AQPnP.

This is achieved by mapping the covariance (uncertainty) matrices of the image points to PnP method. It then uses the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method to minimize the modeled cost function, which has the ability to find the desired solution in real time. The ADMM method solves the system of equations in a manner that is convergent to the global optimal. The ADMM, a widely used operator splitting technique, has drawn significant attention due to its excellent performance in various applications.

In this paper, a new category of moments named octonion fractional-order PHFMs (OFrPHFMs) are proposed using the fractional-order basis functions of PHFMs and octonion theory. The proposed moments can be viewed as a generalization of quaternion orthogonal moments. Furthermore, since the image moments formed by the octonion descriptor can treat the color stereo image integrally, it has a strong representation capability. More importantly, some numerical instability and calculation issues are discussed and a fast computational framework using matrix operation and block Gaussian numerical integration is developed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed OFrPHFMs. Finally, to demonstrate the validation of the proposed moments, the image experiments are conducted and the results show that the proposed OFrPHFMs have favorable performance in the field of color stereo image analysis.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60089926","afid":"60089926","affilname":"Weinan Teachers University","affiliation-city":"Weinan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57566352300","authid":"57566352300","authname":"Peng C.","surname":"Peng","given-name":"Cheng","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60089926"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56498362300","authid":"56498362300","authname":"He B.","surname":"He","given-name":"Bing","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60089926"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57566164400","authid":"57566164400","authname":"Xi W.","surname":"Xi","given-name":"Wenqiang","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60089926"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57565569100","authid":"57565569100","authname":"Lin G.","surname":"Lin","given-name":"Guancheng","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60089926"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color Stereo Image | Fractional-order PHFMs | Image Analysis | Octonions | Polar Harmonic Fourier Moments","source-id":"21101162674","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85163653825"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85163653825?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85163653825&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85163653825&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85163653825","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85163653825","eid":"2-s2.0-85163653825","dc:title":"Application of Adaptive Algorithms on Ultrasound Imaging †","dc:creator":"Idrees M.","prism:publicationName":"Engineering Proceedings","prism:eIssn":"26734591","prism:volume":"32","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.3390/engproc2023032025","dc:description":"Ultrasound, also known as ultrasonography, plays a major role in the medical imaging field.

However, when dealing with color images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), there are certain limitations, such as large operations, multiple noise sources, easy distortion, and missing information in edge detection. To address these shortcomings, this study proposes a UAV color image edge detection method based on an enhanced fireworks algorithm. In this method, the color image pixels of the UAV are represented using quaternions. The explosion amplitude formula of the fireworks is divided into two categories based on the mean value of the number of fireworks explosions. For each category, an explosion formula is proposed, and the explosion mutation operator of the fireworks algorithm is improved accordingly. By applying the proposed algorithm, the preliminary edges of a UAV color image are obtained. Additionally, a novel approach for color image edge refinement is introduced. This approach involves classifying the edge points based on their degree of attachment, which leads to the formation of the edges in a UAV color image. Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm proposed in this study offers several advantages, including fast calculation, strong denoising capability, and high-quality edge detection.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60092861","afid":"60092861","affilname":"Sichuan University of Arts and Science","affiliation-city":"Dazhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026846","afid":"60026846","affilname":"Chengdu University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Chengdu","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54385506700","authid":"54385506700","orcid":"0000-0001-8822-6722","authname":"Liu D.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Dujin","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60092861"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57200380970","authid":"57200380970","authname":"Liang B.","surname":"Liang","given-name":"Bi","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60092861"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58403927600","authid":"58403927600","authname":"Li J.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Jie","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026846"}]}],"article-number":"5430700","source-id":"19900191986","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85163276692"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85163276692?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85163276692&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85163276692&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85163276692","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85163276692","eid":"2-s2.0-85163276692","dc:title":"A Novel Fragile Zero-watermarking Algorithm Based on Quaternion and LBP under the Background of Blockchain","dc:creator":"Liu F.","prism:publicationName":"2023 5th International Conference on Communications, Information System and Computer Engineering, CISCE 2023","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9798350326796"}],"prism:pageRange":"411-414","prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1109/CISCE58541.2023.10142515","dc:description":"After the emergence of blockchain technology, although the problem of copyright protection on the chain has been solved, the problem of cross-chain prosecution and confirmation protection has not been solved.Zero watermarking is a technique that achieves copyright protection without any modification to the carrier image.

In the fitting process, it is generally done over two models. The first of these is the algebraic method and the second one is orthogonal (geometric) method. In this study, we tried to solve the problem of algebraic and orthogonal ellipsoid fitting based on Euler angles for the first time over quaternions. The superiority of quaternions over Euler rotation angles is well known. In addition, the variance–covariance matrix of the parameters of the fitted ellipsoid will also be calculated.

Even though the rise of deep learning promotes the accuracy quite a lot, previous CNN-based methods still suffer from two drawbacks in nature. On one hand, real-valued CNNs break the original structure of the RGB images, and learn color features dependencies and hidden relations mixedly resulting in prediction difficulty when skin is similar. On the other hand, the feature representation for each pixel is only learned by local convolution while the global context information is ignored. To alleviate these problems, we propose a deep learning architecture, named Quaternion Multi-Graph Reasoning Network (QMGR-Net), which contains two novel modules: Quaternion Separation Learning Module (RSLM) and Global Quaternion Reasoning Module (GQRM). The RSLM is proposed to learn color feature dependencies and hidden relations such as edges or shapes at the different level where features can be learned in the quaternion space. Besides, the GQRM is proposed to explicitly capture the interactions among hand joints and model the relationship of non-adjacent nodes. Compared with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the STB dataset and the RHD dataset, we achieve the best results with 7.27 EPE and 18.59 EPE, respectively, which exhibit the effectiveness of our method.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007155","afid":"60007155","affilname":"Guangdong University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/129861924","afid":"129861924","affilname":"Huizhou Innovation Research Institute for Next Generation Industrial Internet","affiliation-city":"Huizhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221558183","authid":"57221558183","authname":"Ni H.","surname":"Ni","given-name":"Haomin","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007155"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401936935","authid":"7401936935","authname":"Xie S.","surname":"Xie","given-name":"Shengli","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007155"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57968720000","authid":"57968720000","authname":"Xu P.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Pingping","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007155"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36992071500","authid":"36992071500","authname":"Fang X.","surname":"Fang","given-name":"Xiaozhao","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007155"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56291872600","authid":"56291872600","orcid":"0000-0002-2342-4434","authname":"Sun W.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Weijun","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007155"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57903130100","authid":"57903130100","authname":"Fang R.","surname":"Fang","given-name":"Ribo","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"129861924"}]}],"authkeywords":"Graph neural network | Hand pose estimation | Quaternion convolution","source-id":"19700177336","fund-acr":"NKRDPC","fund-no":"2018YFB1802400","fund-sponsor":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85162984853"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85162984853?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85162984853&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85162984853&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85162984853","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85162984853","eid":"2-s2.0-85162984853","dc:title":"A real-time ship encounter collision risk detection approach in close-quarters situation","dc:creator":"Sui B.","prism:publicationName":"Measurement and Control (United Kingdom)","prism:issn":"00202940","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1177/00202940231175086","dc:description":"In order to identify ship collision risk for the security of maritime transportation in a close-quarters situation, a novel real-time ship collision risk awareness approach is proposed by developing a novel non-linear velocity obstacle set, QSD-NLVO. More specifically, the Quaternion Ship Domain model was introduced into the non-linear velocity obstacle algorithm, and the conflict position was reasonably defined. By replacing the conflict position with ship domain, the proposed method can more reasonably assess the safety radius of the conflict in different ship encounter scenarios. The presented model enhanced the accuracy of collision risk identification by replacing the collision position in non-linear velocity obstacle algorithm with quaternion ship domain. Finally, case studies were implemented to illustrate the effectiveness of the QSD-NLVO approach. The developed model may be utilized as a guide for investigating port traffic safety as well as a tool for maritime surveillance operators to monitor port traffic collision risks and increase traffic safety.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60069736","afid":"60069736","affilname":"Naval University of Engineering","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57808318100","authid":"57808318100","orcid":"0000-0003-4285-8729","authname":"Sui B.","surname":"Sui","given-name":"Bowen","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069736"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36351259200","authid":"36351259200","authname":"Zhang J.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Jianqiang","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069736"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221434265","authid":"57221434265","authname":"Liu Z.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Zhong","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069736"}]}],"authkeywords":"Collision risk identification | navigation safety | non-linear velocity obstacle | quaternion ship domain | real-time detection","source-id":"15502","fund-no":"2018CFC865","fund-sponsor":"Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85161621532"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85161621532?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85161621532&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85161621532&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85161621532","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85161621532","eid":"2-s2.0-85161621532","dc:title":"QTN: Quaternion Transformer Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification","dc:creator":"Yang X.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","prism:issn":"10518215","prism:eIssn":"15582205","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2023.3283289","dc:description":"Numerous state-of-the-art transformer-based techniques with self-attention mechanisms have recently been demonstrated to be quite effective in the classification of hyperspectral images (HSIs). However, traditional transformer-based methods severely suffer from the following problems when processing HSIs with three dimensions: (1) processing the HSIs using 1D sequences misses the 3D structure information; (2) too expensive numerous parameters for hyperspectral image classification tasks; (3) only capturing spatial information while lacking the spectral information. To solve these problems, we propose a novel Quaternion Transformer Network (QTN) for recovering self-adaptive and long-range correlations in HSIs. Specially, we first develop a band adaptive selection module (BASM) for producing Quaternion data from HSIs. And then, we propose a new and novel quaternion self-attention (QSA) mechanism to capture the local and global representations. Finally, we propose a new and novel transformer method, <italic>i.e</italic>., QTN by stacking a series of QSA for hyperspectral classification. The proposed QTN could exploit computation using Quaternion algebra in hypercomplex spaces. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the QTN outperforms the state-of-the-art vision transformers and convolution neural networks.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025345","afid":"60025345","affilname":"Guangzhou University","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58460331900","authid":"58460331900","authname":"Yang X.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Xiaofei","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025345"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55558020600","authid":"55558020600","authname":"Cao W.","surname":"Cao","given-name":"Weijia","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204137953","authid":"57204137953","authname":"Lu Y.","surname":"Lu","given-name":"Yao","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24175343600","authid":"24175343600","authname":"Zhou Y.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Yicong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]}],"authkeywords":"Convolution | Convolution neural network | Feature extraction | Hyperspectral image classification | Hyperspectral imaging | Image classification | Quaternion transformer network (QTN) | Quaternions | Task analysis | Transformer network | Transformers","source-id":"26027","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85161457560"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85161457560?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85161457560&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85161457560&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85161457560","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85161457560","eid":"2-s2.0-85161457560","dc:title":"36th International Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society Conference, FLAIRS-36 2023","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the International Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society Conference, FLAIRS","prism:issn":"23340754","prism:eIssn":"23340762","prism:volume":"36","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 132 papers.
