The quaternion representation is firstly employed to combine three color channels into a single-channel architecture. Then each color image is respectively encoded into a phase-only function according to quaternion gyrator transform based double phase encoding through phase retrieval technique. Subsequently, all phase-only functions are modulated to obtain the final ciphertext. To remain the content of secret images under cover, only a small part of the encrypted data that is selected by multiplying the random binary amplitude mask is preserved for decryption, where nonlinear quaternion correlation is developed to further perform authentication. Since the proposed encryption algorithm is asymmetric, such interest can significantly enhance security of the cryptosystem. The numerical simulations have demonstrated the feasibility and validity of the proposed scheme as well as its better performance compared with other schemes.","citedby-count":"17","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022381","afid":"60022381","affilname":"Beijing Jiaotong University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020256","afid":"60020256","affilname":"Capital Normal University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55849891700","authid":"55849891700","authname":"Shao Z.","surname":"Shao","given-name":"Zhuhong","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020256"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101867863","authid":"7101867863","authname":"Shang Y.","surname":"Shang","given-name":"Yuanyuan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020256"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020256"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16069434400","authid":"16069434400","authname":"Tong Q.","surname":"Tong","given-name":"Qingbin","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022381"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56870698700","authid":"56870698700","authname":"Ding H.","surname":"Ding","given-name":"Hui","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25959796100","authid":"25959796100","authname":"Zhao X.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Xiaoxu","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35145643500","authid":"35145643500","authname":"Fu X.","surname":"Fu","given-name":"Xiaoyan","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020256"}]}],"authkeywords":"Image authentication | Multiple-image encryption | Partial decryption | Phase retrieval | Quaternion gyrator transform","source-id":"25627","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"SQKM201810028018","fund-sponsor":"Beijing Municipal Excellent Talents Foundation","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85045759697"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85045759697?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85045759697&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85045759697&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0030399217316365"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85045759697","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85045759697","eid":"2-s2.0-85045759697","dc:title":"Quaternion generalized Chebyshev-Fourier and pseudo-Jacobi-Fourier moments for color object recognition","dc:creator":"Singh C.","prism:publicationName":"Optics and Laser Technology","prism:issn":"00303992","prism:volume":"106","prism:pageRange":"234-250","prism:coverDate":"2018-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"October 2018","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.optlastec.2018.03.033","pii":"S0030399217316365","dc:description":"In this paper, the classical generalized Chebyshev-Fourier moments (G-CHFMs) and generalized pseudo–Jacobi-Fourier moments (G-PJFMs) have been extended to represent color images using quaternion algebra.

However, most existing CNN models are based on lower-level handcrafted features from gray or RGB image sequences from small datasets, which are incapable of being generalized for application to various realistic scenarios. Therefore, we propose a new deep learning network for action recognition that integrates quaternion spatial-temporal convolutional neural network (QST-CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM), called QST-CNN-LSTM. Unlike a traditional CNN, the input for a QST-CNN utilizes a quaternion expression for an RGB image, and the values of the red, green, and blue channels are considered simultaneously as a whole in a spatial convolutional layer, avoiding the loss of spatial features. Because the raw images in video datasets are large and have background redundancy, we pre-extract key motion regions from RGB videos using an improved codebook algorithm. Furthermore, the QST-CNN is combined with LSTM for capturing the dependencies between different video clips. Experiments demonstrate that QST-CNN-LSTM is effective for improving recognition rates in the Weizmann, UCF sports, and UCF11 datasets.","citedby-count":"42","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073562","afid":"60073562","affilname":"Northeast Electric Power University","affiliation-city":"Jilin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55729910600","authid":"55729910600","authname":"Meng B.","surname":"Meng","given-name":"Bo","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073562"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201288572","authid":"57201288572","authname":"Liu X.J.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Xue Jun","initials":"X.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073562"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57008295100","authid":"57008295100","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiaolin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073562"}]}],"authkeywords":"Codebook | Convolutional neural network | Human action recognition | Long short-term memory network | Quaternion","source-id":"25627","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"20166016","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85043400215"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85043400215?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85043400215&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85043400215&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85043400215","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85043400215","eid":"2-s2.0-85043400215","dc:title":"RST invariant robust video watermarking algorithm using quaternion curvelet transform","dc:creator":"Agilandeeswari L.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","prism:issn":"13807501","prism:eIssn":"15737721","prism:volume":"77","prism:issueIdentifier":"19","prism:pageRange":"25431-25474","prism:coverDate":"2018-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2018","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11042-018-5800-4","dc:description":"Digital images are widely distributed today over the internet and through other mediums. There are powerful digital image processing tools which have made perfect image duplication a trivial procedure. Therefore, security, copyright protection, and integrity verification of digital video have become an urgent issue in the digital world, which can be achieved by means of a technique called digital watermarking. The issues of watermarking are to achieve imperceptibility, robustness, payload and security simultaneously. This paper presents a new Quaternion Curvelet Transform (QCT) based video watermarking technique for embedding a video on another video in a secure and optimized way. However, many of the existing techniques are unable to handle the problem of rotation, translation and scaling attacks on watermarked video. This study presents a novel embedding approach where in the quaternion transform followed by the traditional Curvelet transform is able to overcome the above disadvantages. In this paper, we first represent the color cover video frames in the quaternion form and subsequently generate Quaternion Curvelet Transform (QCT) coefficients for each such quaternion frames. Second, in order to withstand the desynchronization causes due to the geometrical attacks, the Harris corner detection algorithm is used to determine the invariant feature points on the QCT coefficients, which is followed by the calculation of energy for each block centered on those feature points. Third, in order to maintain the trade-off among the watermarking characteristics, the optimized location for embedding the watermark frames is determined using the cuckoo search optimization algorithm. Finally, to attain the authenticity, an authentication key generation procedure is employed using the owner’s biometric image and the watermarked frames. The experimental results prove that the proposed method is promising in terms of robustness, imperceptibility and security to most notable image processing attacks, geometrical attacks, and video processing attacks among the various conventional watermarking algorithms.","citedby-count":"16","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010618","afid":"60010618","affilname":"Vellore Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Vellore","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55841933400","authid":"55841933400","authname":"Agilandeeswari L.","surname":"Agilandeeswari","given-name":"L.","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010618"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35822178600","authid":"35822178600","authname":"Ganesan K.","surname":"Ganesan","given-name":"K.","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010618"}]}],"authkeywords":"Copyright protection | Digital watermarking | Imperceptibility | Payload | Quaternion curvelet transform | Robustness | Rotation | Scaling | Security | Translation","source-id":"25627","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"VIT University","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055689521"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055689521?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85055689521&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85055689521&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055689521","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85055689521","eid":"2-s2.0-85055689521","dc:title":"Color Image Reconstruction Based on Singular Value Decomposition of Quaternion Matrices","dc:creator":"Zhang X.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of 2018 2nd IEEE Advanced Information Management, Communicates, Electronic and Automation Control Conference, IMCEC 2018","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538618035"}],"prism:pageRange":"2645-2647","prism:coverDate":"2018-09-20","prism:coverDisplayDate":"20 September 2018","prism:doi":"10.1109/IMCEC.2018.8469538","dc:description":"This article gives a constructive proof of singular value decomposition of a quaternion matrix by using the complex representation of quaternion matrices and properties of the eigenvectors.

Nevertheless, the development of a standalone application able to detect the displacement of the user starting only from the data provided by the most common inertial sensors in the mobile phones (accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer), is a complex task. This complexity lies in the hardware disparity, noise on data, and mostly the many movements that the mobile phone can experience and which have nothing to do with the physical displacement of the owner. In our case, we describe a proposal, which, after using quaternions and a Kalman filter to project the sensors readings into an Earth Centered inertial reference system, combines a classic Peak-valley detector with an ensemble of SVMs (Support Vector Machines) and a standard deviation based classifier. Our proposal is able to identify and filter out those segments of signal that do not correspond to the behavior of “walking”, and thus achieve a robust detection of the physical displacement and counting of steps. We have performed an extensive experimental validation of our proposal using a dataset with 140 records obtained from 75 different people who were not connected to this research.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028419","afid":"60028419","affilname":"Universidad de Santiago de Compostela","affiliation-city":"Santiago de Compostela","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023610","afid":"60023610","affilname":"Universidade da Coruña","affiliation-city":"A Coruna","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/115470740","afid":"115470740","affilname":"Situm Technologies S.L.","affiliation-city":"Santiago de Compostela","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"pubmed-id":"30235803","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195644328","authid":"57195644328","orcid":"0000-0003-2064-7285","authname":"Rodríguez G.","surname":"Rodríguez","given-name":"Germán","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"115470740"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/22333514500","authid":"22333514500","authname":"Casado F.E.","surname":"Casado","given-name":"Fernando E.","initials":"F.E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028419"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8432303100","authid":"8432303100","authname":"Iglesias R.","surname":"Iglesias","given-name":"Roberto","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028419"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701842650","authid":"6701842650","authname":"Regueiro C.V.","surname":"Regueiro","given-name":"Carlos V.","initials":"C.V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023610"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195328374","authid":"57195328374","authname":"Nieto A.","surname":"Nieto","given-name":"Adrián","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"115470740"}]}],"authkeywords":"Indoor-positioning | Pedestrian dead reckoning | Sensor fusion | Step counting","article-number":"3157","source-id":"130124","fund-acr":"FEDER","fund-no":"ED431G/01","fund-sponsor":"Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054497438"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054497438?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85054497438&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85054497438&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054497438","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85054497438","eid":"2-s2.0-85054497438","dc:title":"Quaternion-Valued Multi-User MIMO Transmission via Dual-Polarized Antennas and QLLL Reduction","dc:creator":"Stern S.","prism:publicationName":"2018 25th International Conference on Telecommunications, ICT 2018","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538623213"}],"prism:pageRange":"63-69","prism:coverDate":"2018-09-13","prism:coverDisplayDate":"13 September 2018","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICT.2018.8464898","dc:description":"In this paper, quaternion-valued multi-user MIMO equalization is studied for the case of dual-polarized antennas.

A quaternion-valued system and channel model as well as related signal constellations are presented. Both linear and lattice-reduction-aided linear equalization are extended to the problem in hand. For that purpose, a quaternion-valued variant of the famous LLL lattice-reduction algorithm is proposed, which we call QLLL. Its gains in transmission performance and computational complexity over real- and complex-valued LLL reduction are discussed. Besides, the respective diversity orders are generalized to cope with the quaternion-valued channel model. The theoretical studies are complemented by results obtained from numerical simulations.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010586","afid":"60010586","affilname":"Universität Ulm","affiliation-city":"Ulm","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55961030000","authid":"55961030000","authname":"Stern S.","surname":"Stern","given-name":"Sebastian","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010586"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403087446","authid":"7403087446","authname":"Fischer R.","surname":"Fischer","given-name":"Robert F.H.","initials":"R.F.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010586"}]}],"article-number":"8464898","source-id":"21100880166","fund-acr":"DFG","fund-no":"Fi 982/13-1","fund-sponsor":"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054287197"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054287197?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85054287197&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85054287197&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054287197","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85054287197","eid":"2-s2.0-85054287197","dc:title":"Hypercomplex tensor completion with cayley-dickson singular value decomposition","dc:creator":"Mizoguchi T.","prism:publicationName":"ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - Proceedings","prism:issn":"15206149","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538646588"}],"prism:volume":"2018-April","prism:pageRange":"3979-3983","prism:coverDate":"2018-09-10","prism:coverDisplayDate":"10 September 2018","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8462415","dc:description":"Expressing multidimensional information as a value in hypercomplex number systems (e.g., quaternion, octonion, etc.) has great potential, in signal processing applications, to enjoy their nontrivial algebraic benefits which are not available in standard real or complex vector systems.

In this paper, as powerful mathematical tools for wider signal processing applications, we first propose novel definitions of SVD and best low rank approximation of matrices based on algebraic translations of Cayley-Dickson (C-D) number systems. We then derive an algorithmic solution to hypercomplex tensor completion problem based on a convex optimization technique. Numerical experiments in a scenario of color tensor completion problem show that the proposed algorithm recovers much more faithfully the original color information, masked randomly by noise, than a part-wise real tensor completion algorithm.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031126","afid":"60031126","affilname":"Tokyo Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tokyo","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55967323300","authid":"55967323300","authname":"Mizoguchi T.","surname":"Mizoguchi","given-name":"Takehiko","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031126"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35486046100","authid":"35486046100","authname":"Yamada I.","surname":"Yamada","given-name":"Isao","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031126"}]}],"authkeywords":"Cayley-Dickson construction | Convex optimization | Hypercomplex number | Singular value decomposition | Tensor completion","article-number":"8462415","source-id":"110544","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054243294"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054243294?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85054243294&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85054243294&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054243294","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85054243294","eid":"2-s2.0-85054243294","dc:title":"Two-dimensional quaternion sparse principle component analysis","dc:creator":"Xiao X.","prism:publicationName":"ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - Proceedings","prism:issn":"15206149","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538646588"}],"prism:volume":"2018-April","prism:pageRange":"1528-1532","prism:coverDate":"2018-09-10","prism:coverDisplayDate":"10 September 2018","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8462668","dc:description":"Motivated by the facts that, (1), the spatial structure of images and the correlation among color channels are important for color face recognition, and (2), natural face images may be occluded, in this work, we propose two-dimensional quaternion sparse principle component analysis (2DQSPCA) to extract features for color face recognition. 2DQSPCA inherent-1y takes the advantage of 2DPCA in preserving the structure of two-dimensional data, as well as the strength of quaternion-s in representing color images holistically.

Here, quaternion-valued singular spectrum analysis (QSSA) [3] is used to develop a robust 3-D ALE system where in the reconstruction stage of QSSA the eigentriples are adaptively selected (filtered) using the delayed version of the data. Unlike the QALE where (second) order statistics are taken into account, in the proposed QSSA-QALE the full eigen-spectrum of the embedding matrix is exploited. Consequently, the system works for non-Gaussian noise and wideband 3-D periodic signals. The two systems have been implemented and their results compared.

Flexural wave splitting is generally applied to evaluate anisotropy with geophysical inversion methods. Cross-dipole sonic logging has been widely used for anisotropic inversions in horizontal transverse isotropic formations. Traditional methods assume that fast and slow flexural waves are similar in shape and are not dispersive and that the radiation characteristics of the two orthogonal dipole sources are identical. The two above assumptions cannot be satisfied in field conditions. Therefore, the methods used in anisotropy inversion based on these assumptions will lead to inaccurate results. The introduction of the amplitude ratio (AR), the ratio of slow to fast flexural waves, which is not dependent on the source type, can eliminate the wave-shape assumption. Two data sets from orthogonally oriented receivers can be constructed as a quaternion array. Fast and slow flexural waves are the two main incident waves, and other arrivals such as P-waves can be taken as noise. The AR and a quaternion multiple signal classification algorithm are used to demonstrate how to improve the anisotropic inversion and avoid these assumptions. Compared with the traditional method, the new method presents better inversion results for the synthetic example with two different sources. We have determined that the inversion residual from the new objective function can be used to indicate the inversion quality.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016087","afid":"60016087","affilname":"China University of Petroleum-Beijing","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55800085900","authid":"55800085900","authname":"Zeng F.","surname":"Zeng","given-name":"Fuqiang","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016087"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102549324","authid":"7102549324","authname":"Yue W.","surname":"Yue","given-name":"Wenzheng","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016087"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57321292500","authid":"57321292500","authname":"Li C.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Chao","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016087"}]}],"authkeywords":"Anisotropy | Finite difference | Inversion | S-wave","source-id":"27965","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"41374143","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049776274"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049776274?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85049776274&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85049776274&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049776274","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85049776274","eid":"2-s2.0-85049776274","dc:title":"A Complete Framework for Linear Filtering of Bivariate Signals","dc:creator":"Flamant J.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","prism:issn":"1053587X","prism:volume":"66","prism:issueIdentifier":"17","prism:pageRange":"4541-4552","prism:coverDate":"2018-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 September 2018","prism:doi":"10.1109/TSP.2018.2855659","dc:description":"A complete framework for the linear time-invariant (LTI) filtering theory of bivariate signals is proposed based on tailored quaternion Fourier transform.

Our approach simultaneously recovers the 3D structure of the points up to a common scale factor, and is immune to a variety of problems that plague existing methods that are based on the Euclidean homography or Essential matrix. Methods based on homography only function when feature points are coplanar in 3D space. Methods based on the Essential matrix often lose accuracy as the translation between two camera views goes to zero or when points are coplanar. By recovering the rotation and translation independently using quaternions, our algorithm eschews the shortcomings of these methods. Moreover, we do not impose any constraints on the 3D configuration of the points (such as coplanar or non-coplanar constraints). Our method is particularly well-suited for Position-Based Visual Servoing (PBVS) applications. Investigations using both simulations and experiments validate the new method. Comparisons between the proposed algorithm and the existing algorithms establish that our algorithm is robust to noise. A Matlab implementation of our algorithm is available online and free.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60092864","afid":"60092864","affilname":"Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Daegu","affiliation-country":"South Korea"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009415","afid":"60009415","affilname":"The University of Texas at Dallas","affiliation-city":"Richardson","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/40761168200","authid":"40761168200","orcid":"0000-0003-4471-0867","authname":"Fathian K.","surname":"Fathian","given-name":"Kaveh","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009415"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55922318300","authid":"55922318300","authname":"Jin J.","surname":"Jin","given-name":"Jingfu","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009415"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55918833400","authid":"55918833400","authname":"Wee S.G.","surname":"Wee","given-name":"Sung Gil","initials":"S.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60092864"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55698884200","authid":"55698884200","authname":"Lee D.H.","surname":"Lee","given-name":"Dong Ha","initials":"D.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60092864"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55919211500","authid":"55919211500","authname":"Kim Y.G.","surname":"Kim","given-name":"Yoon Gu","initials":"Y.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60092864"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15750786600","authid":"15750786600","authname":"Gans N.R.","surname":"Gans","given-name":"Nicholas R.","initials":"N.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009415"}]}],"authkeywords":"Camera pose estimation | Five point algorithm | Relinearization | Vision based estimation | Visual servoing","source-id":"18079","fund-acr":"MSIP","fund-no":"15-BD-01","fund-sponsor":"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85041185104"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85041185104?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85041185104&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85041185104&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85041185104","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85041185104","eid":"2-s2.0-85041185104","dc:title":"Optimal blind watermarking for color images based on the U matrix of quaternion singular value decomposition","dc:creator":"Liu F.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","prism:issn":"13807501","prism:eIssn":"15737721","prism:volume":"77","prism:issueIdentifier":"18","prism:pageRange":"23483-23500","prism:coverDate":"2018-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 September 2018","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11042-018-5652-y","dc:description":"In this paper, a new blind watermarking for copyright protection of color images based on the U matrix through Quaternion Singular Value Decomposition (QSVD) is proposed.

Recent advancements in hardware and accessibility of smartphones have spawn huge potential for assistive healthcare, in particular telerehabilitation. However, using smartphone sensors face certain challenges, in particular, accurate orientation estimation, which is usually less of a problem in specialized motion tracking sensor devices. Drift is one of the challenges. We first propose a simple feedback loop complementary filter (CFF) to reduce the error caused by the integration of the gyroscope's data in the orientation estimation. Next, we propose a new and better orientation estimation algorithm which combines quaternion-based kalman filter with corrector estimates using gradient descent (KFGD). We then evaluate CFF's and KFGD's performance on two early-stage rehabilitation exercises. The results show that CFF is capable of fast motion tracking and confirm that the feedback loop can correct the error caused by the integration of gyroscope data. The KFGD orientation estimation is comparable to XSENS Awinda and has shown itself to be stable than and outperforms CFF. KFGD also outperforms the prominent Madgwick algorithm using mobile data. Thus, KFGD is suitable for low-cost motion sensors or mobile inertial sensors, especially during early recovery stage of sport injuries and exercise for the elderly.","citedby-count":"25","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60078616","afid":"60078616","affilname":"School of Computer Science and Engineering","affiliation-city":"Singapore City","affiliation-country":"Singapore"}],"pubmed-id":"29990245","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192383054","authid":"57192383054","orcid":"0000-0001-5456-4037","authname":"Yean S.","surname":"Yean","given-name":"Seanglidet","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60078616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7405441352","authid":"7405441352","authname":"Lee B.S.","surname":"Lee","given-name":"Bu Sung","initials":"B.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60078616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102545548","authid":"7102545548","authname":"Yeo C.K.","surname":"Yeo","given-name":"Chai Kiat","initials":"C.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60078616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192372517","authid":"57192372517","authname":"Vun C.H.","surname":"Vun","given-name":"Chan Hua","initials":"C.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60078616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57199093805","authid":"57199093805","orcid":"0000-0001-8007-3151","authname":"Oh H.L.","surname":"Oh","given-name":"Hong Lye","initials":"H.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60078616"}]}],"authkeywords":"Algorithm | assistive healthcare | mobile phone | rehabilitation | sensor fusion | wearable sensor","article-number":"8169018","source-id":"21100256982","fund-acr":"NTU","fund-no":"M4081329.020","fund-sponsor":"Nanyang Technological University","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85032730299"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85032730299?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85032730299&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85032730299&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85032730299","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85032730299","eid":"2-s2.0-85032730299","dc:title":"Stability Analysis of Quaternion-Valued Neural Networks: Decomposition and Direct Approaches","dc:creator":"Liu Y.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","prism:issn":"2162237X","prism:eIssn":"21622388","prism:volume":"29","prism:issueIdentifier":"9","prism:pageRange":"4201-4211","prism:coverDate":"2018-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"September 2018","prism:doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2755697","dc:description":"In this paper, we investigate the global stability of quaternion-valued neural networks (QVNNs) with time-varying delays. On one hand, in order to avoid the noncommutativity of quaternion multiplication, the QVNN is decomposed into four real-valued systems based on Hamilton rules: ij=-ji=k,jk=-kj=i, ki=-ik=j, i{2=j2=k2=ijk=-1. With the Lyapunov function method, some criteria are, respectively, presented to ensure the global μ -stability and power stability of the delayed QVNN. On the other hand, by considering the noncommutativity of quaternion multiplication and time-varying delays, the QVNN is investigated directly by the techniques of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) where quaternion self-conjugate matrices and quaternion positive definite matrices are used. Some new sufficient conditions in the form of quaternion-valued LMI are, respectively, established for the global μ -stability and exponential stability of the considered QVNN. Besides, some assumptions are presented for the two different methods, which can help to choose quaternion-valued activation functions. Finally, two numerical examples are given to show the feasibility and the effectiveness of the main results.","citedby-count":"127","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60135034","afid":"60135034","affilname":"Key Laboratory of Advanced Control and Optimization for Chemical Processes","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073558","afid":"60073558","affilname":"Huzhou University","affiliation-city":"Huzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005244","afid":"60005244","affilname":"Southeast University","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004582","afid":"60004582","affilname":"King Abdulaziz University","affiliation-city":"Jeddah","affiliation-country":"Saudi Arabia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003078","afid":"60003078","affilname":"Zhejiang Normal University","affiliation-city":"Jinhua","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"29989971","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36064307600","authid":"36064307600","orcid":"0000-0003-3761-0104","authname":"Liu Y.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Yang","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003078"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57113812300","authid":"57113812300","orcid":"0000-0001-9211-8644","authname":"Zhang D.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Dandan","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003078"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60135034"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25960227300","authid":"25960227300","orcid":"0000-0002-5325-0404","authname":"Lou J.","surname":"Lou","given-name":"Jungang","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073558"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26643007500","authid":"26643007500","orcid":"0000-0003-4423-6034","authname":"Lu J.","surname":"Lu","given-name":"Jianquan","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004582"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403354075","authid":"7403354075","orcid":"0000-0003-3133-7119","authname":"Cao J.","surname":"Cao","given-name":"Jinde","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]}],"authkeywords":"Global μ-stability | quaternion-valued linear matrix inequality (LMI) | quaternion-valued neural network (QVNN) | time delay","article-number":"8088357","source-id":"21100235616","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"11671361","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85053875672"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85053875672?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85053875672&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85053875672&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85053875672","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85053875672","eid":"2-s2.0-85053875672","dc:title":"Embedded implementation of a nonlinear-observer-based AHRS","dc:creator":"Ramos-G J.","prism:publicationName":"2018 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems, ICUAS 2018","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538613535"}],"prism:pageRange":"363-371","prism:coverDate":"2018-08-31","prism:coverDisplayDate":"31 August 2018","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICUAS.2018.8453401","dc:description":"This paper deals with the implementation of a nonlinear observer to estimate the attitude of a rigid body from the measurements of MARG (Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity) low-cost sensors. As a consequence, the system developed enters into the more general framework of Attitude Heading Reference Systems (AHRS). Thus, a quaternion-based nonlinear observer together with the use of Kaczmarz's method is proposed to fuse the sensor signals. The stability analysis for the attitude error dynamics is carried out using the ISS (Input-to-State Stability) framework. In this sense, the proposed observer is robust stable, when the measurement disturbance is seen as an input and the error as the state. The attitude estimation strategy is very simple to implement and is computationally light, which allows is to be easily deployed across various hardware-software platforms. Particularly, in this work, the algorithm is programmed in the Solidthinking Embed ® software and downloaded in a 32-bit microcontroller Piccolo F28069M, for its use in real-time. Experiments are carried out using a high accuracy system as reference and then comparing with the estimated attitude in order to demonstrate the observer performance.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60103368","afid":"60103368","affilname":"Université de Strasbourg","affiliation-city":"Strasbourg","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024830","afid":"60024830","affilname":"Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla","affiliation-city":"Puebla","affiliation-country":"Mexico"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011025","afid":"60011025","affilname":"Universidad Tecnologica de la Mixteca","affiliation-city":"Huajuapan","affiliation-country":"Mexico"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203978199","authid":"57203978199","authname":"Ramos-G J.","surname":"Ramos-G","given-name":"J.","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024830"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203989658","authid":"57203989658","authname":"Guerero-Castellanos J.F.","surname":"Guerero-Castellanos","given-name":"J.

Finally, the saliency map is calculated according to the prior boundary. The experiments show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is much better than the other classical salient object detection algorithms.
