The system registration allows us to map accurately each point in the world coordinate system into the endoscope image and vice versa to obtain the world line of sight for each image pixel. The key point of our system is a robust linear algorithm based on singular value decomposition (SVD) for estimating simultaneously two unknown coordinate transformations. We show that our algorithm is superior in terms of robustness and computing efficiency to iterative procedures based on Levenberg-Marquardt optimization or on quaternion approaches. The algorithm does not require the calibration pattern to be tracked. Experimental results and simulations verify the robustness and usefulness of our approach. They give an accuracy of less than 0.7 mm and a success rate >99%. We apply the calibrated endoscope to the neurosurgical relevant case of red out, where in spite of the complete loss of vision the surgeon gets visual aids in the endoscope image at the actual position, allowing him/her to manoeuvre a coagulation fibre into the right position. Finally, we outline how our registration algorithm can be used also for standard registration applications (establish the mapping between two sets of points). We propose our algorithm as a linear, non-iterative algorithm also for projective transformations and for 2D-3D-mappings. Thus, it can be seen as a generalization of the well-known Umeyama registration algorithm. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The weighting of potential matches between features is realized on the basis of cross correlation of intensity values and Gobor filter responses. The method is robust to large motions. Corner and SIFT features were used to compare the effectiveness of our method with Kalman filter based tracking of features.

All these parameters make information appear clearer and so increase image contrast, so pathologies like cancer could be detected in a sooner stage of development. The election will depend on the concrete pathological process under study. This Mueller Coherency matrix method can be applied to a single tissue point, or it can be combined with a tomographic technique, so as to obtain a 3D representation of polarization contrast parameters in pathological tissues.

The problem is formulated in a probabilistic framework so as to handle multiple and unavoidable sources of uncertainty: sensor noise, soft tissue deformation and marker slip, inaccurate marker placement and limb measurement, and missing data due to occlusions. All unknown quantities are treated as state variables even though some of them are constant. In this way, state estimation and system identification can be performed simultaneously, obtaining not only the most likely values but also the confidence intervals of the joint angles, skeletal parameters, and marker positions and orientations relative to the limb segments. The inference method is a Gauss-Newton generalization of the extended Kalman filter. It is adapted to the kinematic domain by expressing spatial rotations via quaternions and computing the sensor residuals and their Jacobians analytically. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a reliable data analysis tool used in practice.

A solution to pose and motion estimation problem that uses two-dimensional (2D) intensity images from a single camera is desirable for real-time applications. The difficulty in performing this measurement is that the process of projecting 3D object features to 2D images is a nonlinear transformation. In this paper, the 3D transformation is modeled as a nonlinear stochastic system with the state estimation providing six degrees-of-freedom motion and position values, using line features in image plane as measuring inputs and dual quaternion to represent both rotation and translation in a unified notation. A filtering method called the Gaussian particle filter (GPF) based on the particle filtering concept is presented for 3D pose and motion estimation of a moving target from monocular image sequences. The method has been implemented with simulated data, and simulation results are provided along with comparisons to the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to show the relative advantages of the GPF.

The principal point is assumed to locate at the image center with zero skew and the same aspect ratio, and the interior parameters are fixed, so the self-calibration becomes focal-length calibration. Existing focal length calibration methods are direct solutions of a quadric composed of fundamental matrix, which are sensitive to noise. A quaternion-based linear iterative Least-Square Method is proposed in this paper, and one-dimensional searching for optimal focal length in a constrained region instead of solving optimization problems with inequality constraints is applied to simplify the computation complexity, then unique rotational matrix and translate vector are recovered. Experiments with simulation data and real images are given to verify the algorithm. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025084","afid":"60025084","affilname":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191652005","authid":"57191652005","authname":"Zhou Y.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Yong Jun","initials":"Y.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24321082000","authid":"24321082000","authname":"Kou X.","surname":"Kou","given-name":"Xin Jian","initials":"X.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]}],"authkeywords":"Close-range photogrammetry | Computer vision | General relative orientation | Metric reconstruction | Unit quaternion","source-id":"9500154018","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/40049102499"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/40049102499?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=40049102499&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=40049102499&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/40049102499","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:40049102499","eid":"2-s2.0-40049102499","dc:title":"LSSVM-based blind steganalysis for JPEG images","dc:creator":"Yi B.","prism:publicationName":"Dongnan Daxue Xuebao (Ziran Kexue Ban)/Journal of Southeast University (Natural Science Edition)","prism:issn":"10010505","prism:volume":"37","prism:issueIdentifier":"SUPPL.","prism:pageRange":"81-86","prism:coverDate":"2007-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"September 2007","dc:description":"Least squares support vector machine (LSSVM)-based blind steganalysis for JPEG (joint photographic expert group) images is constructed.

This allows a concise and elegant way of handling signals with eight-dimensional (8-D) vector-valued samples. Using this model, we derive a biquaternionic version of the well-known array processing MUSIC algorithm, and we show its superiority to classically used long-vector approach. New results on biquaternion valued matrix spectral analysis are presented. Of particular interest for the biquaternion MUSIC (BQ-MUSIC) algorithm is the decomposition of the spectral matrix of the data into orthogonal subspaces. We propose an effective algorithm to compute such an orthogonal decomposition of the observation space via the eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of a Hermitian biquaternionic matrix by means of a newly defined quantity, the quaternion adjoint matrix. The BQ-MUSIC estimator is derived and simulation results illustrate its performances compared with two other approaches in polarized antenna processing (LV-MUSIC and PSA-MUSIC). The proposed algorithm is shown to be superior in several aspects to the existing approaches. Compared with LV-MUSIC, the BQ-MUSIC algorithm is more robust to modelization errors and coherent noise while it can detect less sources. In comparaison with PSA-MUSIC, our approach exhibits more accurate estimation of direction of arrival (DOA) for a small number of sources, while keeping the polarization information accessible. © 2007 IEEE.","citedby-count":"128","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104170","afid":"60104170","affilname":"Grenoble Images Parole Signal Automatique","affiliation-city":"Saint Martin d'Heres","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073336","afid":"60073336","affilname":"CRAN Centre de Recherche en Automatique de Nancy","affiliation-city":"Vandoeouvre-les-Nancy","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6507015909","authid":"6507015909","authname":"Le Bihan N.","surname":"Le Bihan","given-name":"Nicolas","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104170"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8345291500","authid":"8345291500","authname":"Miron S.","surname":"Miron","given-name":"Sebastian","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073336"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004216193","authid":"7004216193","authname":"Mars J.I.","surname":"Mars","given-name":"Jérôme I.","initials":"J.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104170"}]}],"authkeywords":"Biquaternion MUSIC (BQ-MUSIC) | Biquaternions and biquaternion-valued matrices | Eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of biquaternionic matrices | Vector-sensor array processing","source-id":"17391","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34548240069"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34548240069?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=34548240069&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=34548240069&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34548240069","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:34548240069","eid":"2-s2.0-34548240069","dc:title":"Polarimetric analysis of bistatic SAR images from polar decomposition: A quaternion approach","dc:creator":"Souyris J.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","prism:issn":"01962892","prism:volume":"45","prism:issueIdentifier":"9","prism:pageRange":"2701-2714","prism:coverDate":"2007-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"September 2007","prism:doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2007.902676","dc:description":"This paper focuses on polar decomposition, which is based on the quaternion formalism, in single-look and multilook synthetic aperture radar polarimetry. Polar decomposition is used to decompose a bistatic or monostatic polarimetric scattering matrix into a product of a Hermitian matrix (boost) and a unitary matrix (rotation). After an overview of polar decomposition principle and quaternion properties, coherent (single-look complex) and incoherent (multilook) polar decompositions are discussed. In single-look polar decomposition, we introduce the boost parameter and the rotation parameter with the purpose of classifying scattering mechanisms of different natures. New relationships between these geometrical parameters and the scattering matrix elements are obtained. We also briefly reexamine the standard coherent polarimetric target decomposition algorithms in the light of quaternions. Next, an original use of polar decomposition for incoherent polarimetric imaging is proposed, which leads to the definition of the multilook boost parameter and of the degree of polarization dispersion. Subsequently, a new approach is presented, which consists in decomposing the scattering matrix into boost and rotation components before vectorization, then in averaging to generate boost and rotation coherency matrices separately. This leads to new inferred parameters: the boost and rotation entropies, and the concurrent dominant scattering mechanisms. The link between these new parameters and standard polarimetric invariants from the Cloude and Pottier decomposition is discussed. Eventually, the multilook extension of polar decomposition may allow this to be applied to the classification of remote sensing data. In this framework, a set of five parameters reducing to four in the monostatic case can be considered. © 2007 IEEE.","citedby-count":"15","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017694","afid":"60017694","affilname":"CNES Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales","affiliation-city":"Paris","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603734458","authid":"6603734458","authname":"Souyris J.","surname":"Souyris","given-name":"Jean Claude","initials":"J.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017694"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/22136626100","authid":"22136626100","authname":"Tison C.","surname":"Tison","given-name":"Céline","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017694"}]}],"authkeywords":"Bistatic polarimetry | Boost entropy | Boost matrix | Coherent polarimetry | Incoherent polarimetry | Multilook polar decomposition | Polar decomposition | Polarimetry | Quaternions | Rotation entropy | Rotation matrix | Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) | Target decomposition","source-id":"17360","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34250860040"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34250860040?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=34250860040&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=34250860040&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0167865507001055"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34250860040","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:34250860040","eid":"2-s2.0-34250860040","dc:title":"Quaternion wavelet phase based stereo matching for uncalibrated images","dc:creator":"Zhou J.","prism:publicationName":"Pattern Recognition Letters","prism:issn":"01678655","prism:volume":"28","prism:issueIdentifier":"12","prism:pageRange":"1509-1522","prism:coverDate":"2007-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 September 2007","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.patrec.2007.03.009","pii":"S0167865507001055","dc:description":"This paper proposes a quaternion wavelet phase based stereo matching (QWPSM) scheme for uncalibrated image pairs. In this scheme, we estimate the disparity by directly establishing correspondences between quaternionic phase structures of two quaternion wavelet filtered (QWF) images. Firstly, linear-phase quaternion wavelet filters (LPQWFs) are constructed from real biorthogonal wavelet bases. Then, quaternion phases are extracted under each scale through quaternion wavelet filtering of the multiscale transformed image pyramids. The disparity estimation is formed as a minimization process of a local energy weighted cost function, and propagated from coarse to fine scales. Costs can adaptively alleviate the negative effects of phase singularities, which are the main causes of mismatches in phase-based stereo matching. Multiscale matching strategy is used to avoid phase wrapping and improve convergence speed. Experimental results are promising in various image pairs. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

While its objective function can be interpreted as consisting of three desired terms: minimising a weighted sum of matching errors of combinations of all the points in the two free form shapes to be matched, equalising their weights (probabilities) of being real ones and also maximising the overlapping area between the free form shapes to be matched, the last term has no effect on the optimisation of the parameters of interest due to normalisation. In this paper, we reformulate the last two terms using the inequality about the geometric and algebraic averages and the sum of the powers of these probabilities. For the sake of computational efficiency, instead of considering combinations of all the points in the overlapping free form shapes to be matched, we employ the traditional closest point criterion to establish possible correspondences between the two overlapping free form shapes to be matched. The saddle point solution of the resulting objective function no longer yields a closed form solution to the parameters of interest. For easy computation, we then adopt a pseudo-linearisation method to linearise the first order derivative of the objective function, leading the parameters of interest to be tracked and estimated with a closed form solution. The parameters of interest are finally optimised using the efficient deterministic annealing scheme with the camera motion parameters estimated using the quaternion method in the weighted least squares sense. A comparative study based on both synthetic data and real images with partial overlap has shown that the proposed algorithm is promising for the automatic matching of overlapping 3D free form shapes subject to a large range of motions. © 2007 Pattern Recognition Society.","citedby-count":"21","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030514","afid":"60030514","affilname":"Aberystwyth University","affiliation-city":"Aberystwyth","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7410228990","authid":"7410228990","authname":"Liu Y.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Yonghuai","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030514"}]}],"authkeywords":"Accurate matching | Mean field annealing | Overlapping area maximisation | Overlapping free form shapes | Registration error minimisation | Weight equalisation","source-id":"24823","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34548248094"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34548248094?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=34548248094&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=34548248094&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34548248094","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:34548248094","eid":"2-s2.0-34548248094","dc:title":"Miniature stereoscopic video system provides real-time 3D registration and image fusion for minimally invasive surgery","dc:creator":"Yaron A.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","prism:issn":"0277786X","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"0819466034"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780819466037"}],"prism:volume":"6490","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2007-08-31","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2007","prism:doi":"10.1117/12.714147","dc:description":"Sophisticated surgeries require the integration of several medical imaging modalities, like MRI and CT, which are threedimensional.

The advantage of using quaternion arithmetic is that a color can be represented and analyzed as a single entity. A low-dimensional basis for the color textures found in a given image is derived via quaternion principal component analysis (QPCA) of a training set of color texture samples. A color texture sample is then projected onto this basis to obtain a concise (single quaternion) description of the texture. To handle the large amount of training data, QPCA is extended to incremental QPCA. The power of the proposed quaternion color texture representation is demonstrated by its use in an unsupervised segmentation algorithm that successfully divides an image into regions on basis of texture. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Fast, numerous hypercomplex 2D Fourier transforms were presented as a generalization of the complex 2D Fourier transform to this new hypercomplex space. Thus, the major problem was to put an interpretation of what information the Fourier coefficients could provide. In this paper, we first define the conditions on the spectrum coefficients needed to reconstruct a colour image without loss of information through the inverse quaternionic Fourier transform process. The result is used to interpret the quaternionic spectrum coefficients of this specific colour Fourier transform. Secondly, with this apprehension of the quaternion numbers and the corresponding colour spectrum space, we define spatial and frequential strategies to filter colour images. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

It has been specifically developed for integration aboard the Thunderstar spacecraft of Starchaser Industries, a three-man capsule designed for space tourism. The system described consists of three principal components: an autoflight computer that generates incidence and roll rate demands from analysis of the predicted flight path trajectory, a quaternion controller that produces a demand torque, and a pulse-width pulse-frequency modulator that determines the necessary thruster fire signals. The spacecraft attitude and flight path dynamics are defined within the upper to middle Earth atmosphere together with the cold gas thruster dynamics. The effect of disturbances on spacecraft attitude has been investigated and the most significant found to be due to crew motion and aerodynamics. The system concept has been evaluated through modelling in SIMULINK and has been found to meet the requirements laid out for a typical Thunderstar mission. © IMechE 2007.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003771","afid":"60003771","affilname":"The University of Manchester","affiliation-city":"Manchester","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57197970933","authid":"57197970933","authname":"Greenland S.","surname":"Greenland","given-name":"S.

In a new way the 1D acoustic signals of French spoken words are represented as 2D signals in the frequency and time domain. These kind of images are then convolved in the quaternion Fourier domain with a quaternion Gabor filter for the extraction of features. This approach allows to greatly reduce the dimension of the feature vector. Two methods of feature extraction are tested. The features vectors were used for the training of a simple MLP, a TDNN and a system of neural experts. The improvement in the classification rate of the neural network classifiers are very encouraging which amply justify the preprocessing in the quaternion frequency domain. This work also suggests the application of the quaternion Fourier transform for other image processing tasks. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","citedby-count":"56","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60138276","afid":"60138276","affilname":"Université Clermont Auvergne","affiliation-city":"Clermont-Ferrand","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018216","afid":"60018216","affilname":"CINVESTAV Unidad Guadalajara","affiliation-city":"Guadalajara","affiliation-country":"Mexico"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003485536","authid":"7003485536","authname":"Bayro-Corrochano E.","surname":"Bayro-Corrochano","given-name":"Eduardo","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018216"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701843441","authid":"6701843441","authname":"Trujillo N.","surname":"Trujillo","given-name":"Noel","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60138276"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004480632","authid":"7004480632","authname":"Naranjo M.","surname":"Naranjo","given-name":"Michel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60138276"}]}],"authkeywords":"Feature extraction | Fourier transform | Multi-layer perceptrons | Neural network experts | Neural networks | Preprocessing | Quaternion algebra | Quaternion Fourier transform | Speech recognition | Time delay neural network","source-id":"28501","fund-no":"COECYTJal 42-2001","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34249776679"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34249776679?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=34249776679&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=34249776679&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34249776679","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:34249776679","eid":"2-s2.0-34249776679","dc:title":"An efficient color-impulse detector and its application to color images","dc:creator":"Jin L.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","prism:issn":"10709908","prism:volume":"14","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"397-400","prism:coverDate":"2007-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2007","prism:doi":"10.1109/LSP.2006.887840","dc:description":"By analyzing quaternion rotation theory, the color difference between two color pixels can be represented in quaternion form. Based on this representation of color difference, an efficient color-impulse detector for switching vector median filters is presented. Extensive simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm provides a significant improvement over many of the existing vector filtering techniques in suppressing impulses with different noise ratios. In particular, the proposed approach effectively preserves the fine thin lines and other detail features. The low computational complexity is also one of its advantages. © 2007 IEEE.","citedby-count":"53","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025761","afid":"60025761","affilname":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15922652500","authid":"15922652500","authname":"Jin L.","surname":"Jin","given-name":"Lianghai","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55704068700","authid":"55704068700","authname":"Li D.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Dehua","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]}],"authkeywords":"Impulsive noise | Noise detection | Quaternion rotation | Vector median filters","source-id":"17316","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
