In conventional methods for estimating the F-Matrix, an eight-point algorithm is adopted. First, an approximate F-Matrix is calculated by a linear solver using at least eight corresponding pairs. Since this linear optimization method excludes an essential property, the rank 2 constraint, a method based on a singular value decomposition (SVD) is applied to impose the constraint. This last step with SVD, however, provides additional noise in the F-Matrix. Several methods introduce parameterizations taking into account the rank 2 constraint and optimized nonlinearly without SVD. In this paper, we propose a novel parameterization for the nonlinear optimization which includes this constraint. We adopt double quaternion (DQ) and a scalar as the parameter set. Experimental results show that the nonlinear optimization with our parameterization is competitive with other parameterization methods. Moreover, through the proposed parameterization, we can obtain two transformations for the two input images. These transformations lead to a novel method to estimate epipolar lines and to rectify the image pairs. This rectification method can deal with any image pairs in the same manner whether the epipoles are inside or outside the images. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The first way in which this arises is via the transfer function of a filter. This leads to questions about polynomials and rational functions, which can sometimes be solved by ideas from algebraic geometry, often with better results than through numerical methods. The second application of algebra is to image processing. We already saw how three-dimensional rotations can be simply described by quaternions – now we look at an application in face recognition.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032179","afid":"60032179","affilname":"University of Wisconsin-Madison","affiliation-city":"Madison","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"ch","subtypeDescription":"Book Chapter","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13609689900","authid":"13609689900","authname":"Boston N.","surname":"Boston","given-name":"Nigel","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032179"}]}],"authkeywords":"Distinct zero | Face recognition | Geometric algebra | Signature curve | Signature surface","source-id":"21100856557","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84898776520"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84898776520?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84898776520&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84898776520&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84898776520","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84898776520","eid":"2-s2.0-84898776520","dc:title":"Monte Carlo pose estimation with quaternion kernels and the Bingham distribution","dc:creator":"Glover J.","prism:publicationName":"Robotics: Science and Systems","prism:issn":"23307668","prism:eIssn":"2330765X","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780262517799"}],"prism:volume":"7","prism:pageRange":"97-104","prism:coverDate":"2012-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","dc:description":"The success of personal service robotics hinges upon reliable manipulation of everyday household objects, such as dishes, bottles, containers, and furniture. In order to accurately manipulate such objects, robots need to know objects' full 6-DOF pose, which is made difficult by clutter and occlusions. Many household objects have regular structure that can be used to effectively guess object pose given an observation of just a small patch on the object. In this paper, we present a new method to model the spatial distribution of oriented local features on an object, which we use to infer object pose given small sets of observed local features. The orientation distribution for local features is given by a mixture of Binghams on the hypersphere of unit quaternions, while the local feature distribution for position given orientation is given by a locally-weighted (Quaternion kernel) likelihood. Experiments on 3D point cloud data of cluttered and uncluttered scenes generated from a structured light stereo image sensor validate our approach.","citedby-count":"29","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104045","afid":"60104045","affilname":"Willow Garage, Inc.","affiliation-city":"Menlo Park","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006320","afid":"60006320","affilname":"MIT Computer Science &amp; Artificial Intelligence Laboratory","affiliation-city":"Cambridge","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202417761","authid":"7202417761","authname":"Glover J.","surname":"Glover","given-name":"Jared","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006320"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602226632","authid":"6602226632","authname":"Bradski G.","surname":"Bradski","given-name":"Gary","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104045"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15758234800","authid":"15758234800","authname":"Rusu R.B.","surname":"Rusu","given-name":"Radu Bogdan","initials":"R.B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104045"}]}],"source-id":"21100448299","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84887933489"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84887933489?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84887933489&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84887933489&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84887933489","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84887933489","eid":"2-s2.0-84887933489","dc:title":"3-D biquaternionic analytic signal and application to envelope detection in 3-D ultrasound imaging","dc:creator":"Wang L.","prism:publicationName":"2012 International Conference on 3D Imaging, IC3D 2012 - Proceedings","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781479915804"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2012-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","prism:doi":"10.1109/IC3D.2012.6615144","dc:description":"This paper gives an algebraic framework for 3-D analytic signals and realizes a numerical implementation of Clifford Fourier transformation and Clifford biquaternions. By applying the hypercomplex analytic signal, the module and partial modules of a biquaternion are proposed. Our method is applied to the ultrasound data from a phantom with a biopsy needle inserted. The biquaternion pseudo-envelope of a radio frequency ultrasound volume data is introduced from the partial module of the ultrasound volume biquaternionic analytic signal. This method shows several advantages comparing with the 1-D envelope results. When the envelope of a radio frequency ultrasound volume is calculated based on conventional 1-D method, there are possible losses of information as we expected. As the result of that, the biquaternion pseudo-envelope detection method is preferred in order to take into account the information of the other dimensions of data and to obtain a better visual

characterization of subgrain microstructural features permits study of the relationships among loading, microstructure and properties in plastically deformed metals. 3D electron backscatter diffraction data can produce reconstructed crystallographic volumes, however low angle subgrain boundaries cannot be determined simply with point-to-point misorientation thresholding because many are

We demonstrate a novel 3D implementation of the data segmentation technique Fast Multiscale Clustering, which uses a quaternion representation of orientation and a corresponding distance metric.

The second generation wavelet transform constructed by the lifting scheme for the quaternion rotation representation can be used. Quaternions in terms of motion analysis are a more efficient representation of rotation than Euler angles.

Images are segmented to patches by a regular grid, and quaternion singular value decomposition (QSVD) is used to extract color features for each patch, and the grey features are extracted by Gabor filter and then using orientation histogram to descript the grey information. And then combine the color features and the orientation histogram together with the same weight to obtain the descriptor for each patch. All the patch descriptors are clustered and quantified to get visual words. Then the Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) is applied to the visual words to get the subspaces of the category. The descriptors of a test image then are projected to the subspaces of all categories to get the projection length to all categories of the test image. Finally, Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear kernel function is used to get the scene classification performance.

This paper presents the results of the attitude determination using an in-house designed low-cost MEMS-based flight information measurement unit. This study proposes a quaternion-based extended Kalman filter to integrate the traditional quaternion and gravitational force decomposition methods for attitude determination algorithm. The proposed extended Kalman filter utilizes the evolution of the four elements in the quaternion method for attitude determination as the dynamic model, with the four elements as the states of the filter. The attitude angles obtained from the gravity computations and from the electronic magnetic sensors are regarded as the measurement of the filter. The immeasurable gravity accelerations are deduced from the outputs of the three axes accelerometers, the relative accelerations, and the accelerations due to body rotation. The constraint of the four elements of the quaternion method is treated as a perfect measurement and is integrated into the filter computation. Approximations of the time-varying noise variances of the measured signals are discussed and presented with details through Taylor series expansions. The algorithm is intuitive, easy to implement, and reliable for long-term high dynamic maneuvers. Moreover, a set of flight test data is utilized to demonstrate the success and practicality of the proposed algorithm and the filter design. © 2012 by the authors.","citedby-count":"32","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018405","afid":"60018405","affilname":"Tamkang University","affiliation-city":"New Taipei City","affiliation-country":"Taiwan"}],"pubmed-id":"22368455","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402075442","authid":"7402075442","authname":"Ma D.M.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Der Ming","initials":"D.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018405"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005542972","authid":"7005542972","authname":"Shiau J.K.","surname":"Shiau","given-name":"Jaw Kuen","initials":"J.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018405"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55268372800","authid":"55268372800","authname":"Chiang Wang I.","surname":"Chiang Wang","given-name":"I.","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018405"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55267940700","authid":"55267940700","authname":"Lin Y.H.","surname":"Lin","given-name":"Yu Heng","initials":"Y.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018405"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude determination | Extended kalman filter | Flight information measurement unit | Quaternion","source-id":"130124","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84863012229"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84863012229?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84863012229&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84863012229&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84863012229","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84863012229","eid":"2-s2.0-84863012229","dc:title":"Decentralized adaptive output feedback attitude synchronization tracking control of satellite formation flying","dc:creator":"Zhou J.","prism:publicationName":"International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control","prism:issn":"13494198","prism:volume":"8","prism:issueIdentifier":"1 B","prism:pageRange":"977-988","prism:coverDate":"2012-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"January 2012","dc:description":"A quaternion-based attitude synchronization tracking problem is treated for satellite formation flying without using absolute and relative angular velocity measurements. More specifically, an adaptive control based output feedback attitude synchronization tracking control law is first developed under the requirement of communication links between each satellite in formation and the desired trajectory. The controller structure includes a low-pass linear filter state that is derived without explicit differentiation of attitude to synthesize angular velocity-like signals, and a parameter updating law is also involved to identify the satellite inertia matrix such that no knowledge of the inertia of the satellites in formation is required prior. Then, a modified control law is investigated by involving distributed finite-time sliding mode estimator to relax the requirement that every satellite has access to the desired angular velocity from the practical view of inexpensive online computations. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control law, especially, potential advantages derived through the inclusion of the integral feedback term within the control law being evaluated by computing the attitude synchronization tracking error convergence in the presence of unknown disturbance torques. © 2012 ICIC International.","citedby-count":"14","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/37062566800","authid":"37062566800","authname":"Zhou J.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Jiakang","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8931326900","authid":"8931326900","authname":"Hu Q.","surname":"Hu","given-name":"Qinglei","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13403245700","authid":"13403245700","authname":"Ma G.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Guangfu","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude cooperative | Output feedback | Satellite formation flying | Sliding-mode estimator","source-id":"12000154489","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84861717590"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84861717590?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84861717590&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84861717590&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84861717590","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84861717590","eid":"2-s2.0-84861717590","dc:title":"Twisted quaternary neural networks","dc:creator":"Kobayashi M.","prism:publicationName":"IEEJ Transactions on Electrical and Electronic Engineering","prism:issn":"19314973","prism:eIssn":"19314981","prism:volume":"7","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"397-401","prism:coverDate":"2012-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2012","prism:doi":"10.1002/tee.21746","dc:description":"The quaternary neural network (QNN) proposed by Nitta is a high-dimensional neural network. Nitta showed that its learning is faster than that of ordinary neural networks and the number of required parameters is almost one-third of that of real-valued neural networks by computer simulations. In this paper, we propose the twisted quaternary neural network (TQNN) which modifies the directions of multiplications of the QNN. Since quaternions are noncommutative on multiplication, we can get another neural network. When the activation function is linear, multilayered neural networks can be expressed by single-layered neural networks. But the TQNN cannot be expressed by a single-layered QNN even if the activation function is linear. Therefore, the TQNN is expected to produce a variety of signal-processing systems. We performed computer simulations to compare the QNN and the TQNN. Then we found that the latter's learning is a little faster. Moreover, computer simulation showed that the QNN tended to be trapped in local minima or plateaus but the TQNN did not. It is said that reducibility causes local minima and plateaus. We discuss the differences of reducibility between the QNN and the TQNN as well. © 2012 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.","citedby-count":"15","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009064","afid":"60009064","affilname":"University of Yamanashi","affiliation-city":"Kofu","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55741799500","authid":"55741799500","authname":"Kobayashi M.","surname":"Kobayashi","given-name":"Masaki","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009064"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55235881300","authid":"55235881300","authname":"Nakajima A.","surname":"Nakajima","given-name":"Akihiro","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009064"}]}],"authkeywords":"Backpropagation algorithm | Learning | Neural networks | Quaternion","source-id":"5300152212","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84860858423"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84860858423?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84860858423&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84860858423&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84860858423","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84860858423","eid":"2-s2.0-84860858423","dc:title":"Color-dependent diffusion equations based on quaternion algebra","dc:creator":"Li Y.","prism:publicationName":"Chinese Journal of Electronics","prism:issn":"10224653","prism:eIssn":"20755597","prism:volume":"21","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"277-282","prism:coverDate":"2012-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2012","dc:description":"Based on quaternion algebra, this paper proposes two new smoothing models called color-dependent diffusion equations. One model is designed to only smooth the components in the direction of a chosen color. The other model is designed to only smooth the components perpendicular to the direction of a chosen color. To improve the color selectivity, a weight factor W is proposed. For example, if we filter the parallel components of the image, greater weight is given to pixels with the color close to the chosen color. Finally, a color-dependent diffusion scheme is presented, which can detect a chosen color edge or low-pass filter a certain color efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme applied to natural color images.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073423","afid":"60073423","affilname":"Baoji University of Arts and Sciences","affiliation-city":"Baoji","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025578","afid":"60025578","affilname":"Xidian University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55719081300","authid":"55719081300","authname":"Li Y.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Yafeng","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073423"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403047090","authid":"7403047090","authname":"Feng X.","surname":"Feng","given-name":"Xiangchu","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195302409","authid":"57195302409","authname":"Wang W.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Weiwei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image filtering | Color-dependent | Denoising | Diffusion equation | Quaternion","source-id":"24184","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84859319655"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84859319655?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84859319655&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84859319655&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84859319655","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84859319655","eid":"2-s2.0-84859319655","dc:title":"Fast hypercomplex polar fourier analysis","dc:creator":"Yang Z.","prism:publicationName":"IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems","prism:issn":"09168532","prism:eIssn":"17451361","prism:volume":"E95-D","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"1166-1169","prism:coverDate":"2012-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2012","prism:doi":"10.1587/transinf.E95.D.1166","dc:description":"Hypercomplex polar Fourier analysis treats a signal as a vector field and generalizes the conventional polar Fourier analysis. It can handle signals represented by hypercomplex numbers such as color images. Hypercomplex polar Fourier analysis is reversible that means it can reconstruct image. Its coefficient has rotation invariance property that can be used for feature extraction. However in order to increase the computation speed, fast algorithm is needed especially for image processing applications like realtime systems and limited resource platforms.

By applying the quaternion unit transform theory, the difference between two color pixels can be represented in the quaternion form. Based on the difference mentioned above, an efficient filter that can switch between the vector median filter (VMF) and the identity filter (no filtering operation) is proposed. Extensive simulation result indicates that the proposed filter achieves a trade-off between noise suppression and detail preservation in both correlated and uncorrelated impulse noise scenarios when compared with other widely used filters. Furthermore, the computational complexity analysis shows that the proposed filter is quite efficient. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","citedby-count":"58","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013789","afid":"60013789","affilname":"Beihang University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26656636600","authid":"26656636600","authname":"Geng X.","surname":"Geng","given-name":"Xin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013789"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14619446700","authid":"14619446700","authname":"Hu X.","surname":"Hu","given-name":"Xiaoguang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013789"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35811740300","authid":"35811740300","authname":"Xiao J.","surname":"Xiao","given-name":"Jin","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013789"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image | Impulse noise | Quaternion unit transform | Switching filter","source-id":"25548","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
