However, the conventional LLC with real setting is just designed for the grayscale image. For the color image, it usually treats each color channel individually or encodes the monochrome image by concatenating all the color channels, which ignores the correlations among different channels. In this paper, we propose a quaternion-based locality-constrained coding (QLC) model for color face hallucination in the quaternion space. In QLC, the face images are represented as quaternion matrices. By transforming the channel images into an orthogonal feature space and encoding the coefficients in the quaternion domain, the proposed QLC is expected to learn the advantages of both quaternion algebra and locality coding scheme. Hence, the QLC cannot only expose the true topology of image patch manifold but also preserve the inherent correlations among different color channels. Experimental results demonstrated that our proposed QLC method achieved superior performance in color face hallucination compared with other state-of-the-art methods.","citedby-count":"23","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032356","afid":"60032356","affilname":"Hunan University","affiliation-city":"Changsha","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"pubmed-id":"28541233","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55970181500","authid":"55970181500","orcid":"0000-0003-4891-9211","authname":"Liu L.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Licheng","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7409240361","authid":"7409240361","orcid":"0000-0002-0585-9848","authname":"Li S.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Shutao","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/47861886300","authid":"47861886300","orcid":"0000-0001-5451-7230","authname":"Chen C.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"C.

Copy–move (or copy–paste) forgery is the most common form of tampering associated with color images. Conventional copy–move forgeries detection techniques usually suffer from the problems of false positives and susceptibility to many signal processing operations. It is a challenging work to design a robust copy–move forgery detection method. In this paper, we present a novel block-based robust copy–move forgery detection approach using invariant quaternion exponent moments (QEMs). Firstly, original tempered color image is preprocessed with Gaussian low-pass filter, and the filtered color image is divided into overlapping circular blocks. Then, the accurate and robust feature descriptor, QEMs modulus, is extracted from color image block holistically as a vector field. Finally, exact Euclidean locality sensitive hashing is utilized to find rapidly the matching blocks, and the falsely matched block pairs are removed by customizing the random sample consensus with QEMs magnitudes differences. Extensive experimental results show the efficacy of the newly proposed approach in detecting copy–paste forgeries under various challenging conditions, such as noise addition, lossy compression, scaling, and rotation. We obtain the average forgery detection accuracy (F-measure) in excess of 96 and 88% across postprocessing operations, at image level and at pixel level, respectively.","citedby-count":"46","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017010","afid":"60017010","affilname":"Liaoning Normal University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972239800","authid":"34972239800","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiang yang","initials":"X.y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56604552600","authid":"56604552600","authname":"Liu Y.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Yu nan","initials":"Y.n.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190879168","authid":"57190879168","authname":"Xu H.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Huan","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56244170000","authid":"56244170000","authname":"Wang P.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Pei","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972350300","authid":"34972350300","authname":"Yang H.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Hong ying","initials":"H.y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]}],"authkeywords":"Copy–move forgery detection | Digital image forensics | E2LSH | Quaternion exponent moments","source-id":"24822","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85046955853"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85046955853?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85046955853&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85046955853&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85046955853","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85046955853","eid":"2-s2.0-85046955853","dc:title":"Automatic global registration between airborne LiDAR data and remote sensing image based on straight line features","dc:creator":"Liu Z.Q.","prism:publicationName":"International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives","prism:issn":"16821750","prism:volume":"42","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"1191-1197","prism:coverDate":"2018-04-30","prism:coverDisplayDate":"30 April 2018","prism:doi":"10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-3-1191-2018","dc:description":"An automatic global registration approach for point clouds and remote sensing image based on straight line features is proposed which is insensitive to rotational and scale transformation. First, the building ridge lines and contour lines in point clouds are automatically detected as registration primitives by integrating region growth and topology identification.

The similarity measure is established according to the distance between the corresponding straight line features from point clouds and the image in the same reference coordinate system. Finally, an iterative Hough transform is adopted to simultaneously estimate the parameters and obtain correspondence between registration primitives.

While for outdoor positioning accurate and robust solutions (i.e. GPS) exist for many years, indoor positioning is still very challenging. There is also a need of gesture/motion tracking systems that could replace video solutions. We propose in this paper a hardware/software platform named Zyggie that combines both Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) for low power accurate indoor positioning and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) utilization for motion tracking. Very few industrial/academic existing solutions can simultaneously perform indoor positioning and motion tracking and none of them can do both under low power, low cost and compacity constraints addressed by our platform. As Zyggie has the capability to estimate distances w.r.t other platforms in the environment and quaternions (which represents the attitude/orientation) users can test/enhance state of the art algorithms for positioning and motion tracking applications.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030553","afid":"60030553","affilname":"Université de Rennes 1","affiliation-city":"Rennes","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26221629500","authid":"26221629500","authname":"Courtay A.","surname":"Courtay","given-name":"Antoine","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030553"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56642738100","authid":"56642738100","authname":"Le Gentil M.","surname":"Le Gentil","given-name":"Mickaël","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030553"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6506120879","authid":"6506120879","authname":"Berder O.","surname":"Berder","given-name":"Olivier","initials":"O.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030553"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/37010824800","authid":"37010824800","authname":"Carer A.","surname":"Carer","given-name":"Arnaud","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030553"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603037769","authid":"6603037769","authname":"Scalart P.","surname":"Scalart","given-name":"Pascal","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030553"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603040542","authid":"6603040542","authname":"Sentieys O.","surname":"Sentieys","given-name":"Olivier","initials":"O.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030553"}]}],"article-number":"8351278","source-id":"56190","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050924957"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050924957?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85050924957&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85050924957&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050924957","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85050924957","eid":"2-s2.0-85050924957","dc:title":"On quaternion kernel adaptive filtering of nonwhite, noncircular, and non-Gaussian inputs","dc:creator":"Paul T.","prism:publicationName":"Conference Record of 51st Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers, ACSSC 2017","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538618233"}],"prism:volume":"2017-October","prism:pageRange":"825-828","prism:coverDate":"2018-04-10","prism:coverDisplayDate":"10 April 2018","prism:doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.2017.8335462","dc:description":"Much work has been done recently on exploring the use of quaternions for applications such as pattern recognition and robotics. Towards this goal, methods for designing adaptive filters with quaternions have been developed. Additionally, adaptive algorithms that optimally consider the various possible forms of input diversity are being considered. Specifically, input characteristics of nonwhiteness, noncircularity, and non-Gaussianity have been studied.

This problem is traditionally solved using the epipolar constraint, where the rotation and translation changes are recovered from the essential matrix. We propose a new formulation based on quaternion representation of rotation. Using this formulation, we recover the rotation and translation changes separately without resorting to an essential matrix. We compare the estimation accuracy and execution time of the proposed method with several state-of-the-art algorithms using both synthetic and actual image sequences. On average, our approach shows better accuracy in the presence of noise, but it has a larger execution time. For the benefit of community, we have made the implementation of our algorithm available online and free.","citedby-count":"22","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033291","afid":"60033291","affilname":"Universidad de Guanajuato","affiliation-city":"Guanajuato","affiliation-country":"Mexico"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009415","afid":"60009415","affilname":"The University of Texas at Dallas","affiliation-city":"Richardson","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001982","afid":"60001982","affilname":"Eglin Air Force Base","affiliation-city":"Valparaiso","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/40761168200","authid":"40761168200","orcid":"0000-0003-4471-0867","authname":"Fathian K.","surname":"Fathian","given-name":"Kaveh","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009415"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36706569900","authid":"36706569900","orcid":"0000-0002-8746-1760","authname":"Ramirez-Paredes J.P.","surname":"Ramirez-Paredes","given-name":"J.

By using Hubel-based robust filtering methodology to correct the measurement covariance formulation of cubature Kalman filter, the proposed filtering algorithm could effectively suppress the measurement model error. To further enhance this effect and reduce the impact of the dynamics model error, two different adaptively robust filtering algorithms, one with the optimal adaptive factor based on the estimated covariance matrix of the predicted residuals and the other with multiple fading factors based on strong tracking algorithm, are developed and applied for the satellite attitude estimation. The quaternion is employed to represent the global attitude parameter, and three-dimensional generalized Rodrigues parameters are introduced to define the local attitude error. A multiplicative quaternion error is derived from the local attitude error to maintain quaternion normalization constraint in the filter. Simulation results indicate that the proposed novel algorithm could exhibit higher accuracy and faster convergence compared with the multiplicative extended Kalman filter, the unscented quaternion estimator, and the adaptive robust unscented Kalman filter.","citedby-count":"36","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003353","afid":"60003353","affilname":"Harbin Engineering University","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193752270","authid":"57193752270","authname":"QIU Z.","surname":"QIU","given-name":"Zhenbing","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003353"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24776483600","authid":"24776483600","authname":"QIAN H.","surname":"QIAN","given-name":"Huaming","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003353"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55738608100","authid":"55738608100","authname":"WANG G.","surname":"WANG","given-name":"Guoqing","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003353"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude estimation | Cubature Kalman filter | Multiple fading factors | Optimal adaptive factor | Robust filtering","source-id":"13831","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"2014RFXXJ074","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherhybridgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Hybrid Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85038008612"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85038008612?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85038008612&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85038008612&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0165168417304152"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85038008612","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85038008612","eid":"2-s2.0-85038008612","dc:title":"Quaternion representation based visual saliency for stereoscopic image quality assessment","dc:creator":"Wang X.","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing","prism:issn":"01651684","prism:volume":"145","prism:pageRange":"202-213","prism:coverDate":"2018-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2018","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.sigpro.2017.12.002","pii":"S0165168417304152","dc:description":"In this paper, a novel visual saliency detection method for stereoscopic images is proposed for the stereoscopic image quality assessment (SIQA) by considering the disparity map and difference image between the stereo image pairs.

The quaternion Fourier transform (QFT) is performed on the constructed QR to generate the visual saliency maps for left and right views of stereoscopic image pairs, respectively. The generated visual saliency maps are further incorporated into the quality metrics for SIQA. Experimental results demonstrate that the visual saliency maps generated by the proposed method can help significantly boost the performance of SIQA, comparing with other visual saliency models proposed for stereoscopic images.

First, a novel theory of reduced geometric algebra (RGA) is provided, including commutative sparse basis and the geometric operations. Second, taking advantage of the RGA theory, the model represents color image with three-channel as a multivector with the spatial and spectral information in RGA space. Third, the dictionary learning algorithm is provided using the K-RGA-based singular value decomposition (K-RGASVD) (generalized K-means clustering for RGASVD) method. The comparison results demonstrate the proposed model can remove the data redundancy and reduce the computational complexity, and can meanwhile effectively preserve the inherent color structures.

Simulation results show that the proposed VLC and IMU integration algorithm can reduce the positioning solution errors to less than 0.23 m.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005244","afid":"60005244","affilname":"Southeast University","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206485386","authid":"57206485386","authname":"Zou Q.","surname":"Zou","given-name":"Qian","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102122609","authid":"7102122609","authname":"Xia W.","surname":"Xia","given-name":"Weiwei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56491709900","authid":"56491709900","authname":"Zhu Y.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Yaping","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192573454","authid":"57192573454","authname":"Zhang J.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Jing","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201879401","authid":"57201879401","authname":"Huang B.","surname":"Huang","given-name":"Bonan","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55005593100","authid":"55005593100","authname":"Yan F.","surname":"Yan","given-name":"Feng","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9733789400","authid":"9733789400","authname":"Shen L.","surname":"Shen","given-name":"Lianfeng","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]}],"authkeywords":"indoor positioning algorithm | inertial measurement unit (IMU) | visible light communication (VLC)","source-id":"21100867529","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61201175","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85045762246"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85045762246?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85045762246&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85045762246&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85045762246","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85045762246","eid":"2-s2.0-85045762246","dc:title":"Quaternion wavelet transform for image denoising","dc:creator":"Umam A.K.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Physics: Conference Series","prism:issn":"17426588","prism:eIssn":"17426596","prism:volume":"974","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2018-03-22","prism:coverDisplayDate":"22 March 2018","prism:doi":"10.1088/1742-6596/974/1/012006","dc:description":"Quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) combines discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and quaternion Fourier transform (QFT).

Therefore, the first task was carried out to give a demonstration for spatial imagery and attitude determination missions through a wireless communication. The smart phone's Bluetooth was used to achieve this goal inclusive of a new method to enable real time transmission. In addition, an algorithm around a quaternion based Kalman filter was included in order to detect the reliability of the prototype's orientation. The second task was carried out to provide a demonstration for the attitude control mission using the smart phone's orientation sensor, including a new method for an autonomous guided mode. As a result, the acquisition platform showed real time measurement with good accuracy for orientation detection and image transmission.

This causes difficulties in both understanding their behavior and designing optimal filters. Based on a thorough exploration of the augmented statistics of quaternion random vectors, this paper extends an analysis framework for real-valued adaptive filters to the mean and mean square convergence analyses of general quaternion adaptive filters in nonstationary environments. The extension is nontrivial, considering the noncommutative quaternion algebra, only recently resolved issues with quaternion gradient, and the multidimensional augmented quaternion statistics. Also, for rigor, in order to model a nonstationary environment, the system weights are assumed to vary according to a first-order random-walk model. Transient and steady-state performance of a general class of quaternion adaptive filters is provided by exploiting the augmented quaternion statistics. An innovative quaternion decorrelation technique allows us to develop intuitive closed-form expressions for the performance of quaternion least mean square (QLMS) filters with Gaussian inputs, which provide new insights into the relationship between the filter behavior and the complete second-order statistics of the input signal, that is, quaternion noncircularity. The closed-form expressions for the performance of strictly linear, semiwidely linear, and widely linear QLMS filters are investigated in detail, while numerical simulations for the three classes of QLMS filters with correlated Gaussian inputs support the theoretical analysis.","citedby-count":"31","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015150","afid":"60015150","affilname":"Imperial College London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189332044","authid":"57189332044","orcid":"0000-0002-0239-3392","authname":"Xiang M.","surname":"Xiang","given-name":"Min","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56135784800","authid":"56135784800","orcid":"0000-0001-5714-461X","authname":"Kanna S.","surname":"Kanna","given-name":"Sithan","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006513328","authid":"7006513328","orcid":"0000-0001-8432-3963","authname":"Mandic D.","surname":"Mandic","given-name":"Danilo P.","initials":"D.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]}],"authkeywords":"improper signals | least mean square | mean square analysis | noncircularity | Quaternion adaptive filters | stability | steady-state performance","article-number":"8239856","source-id":"17391","fund-acr":"EPSRC","fund-no":"EP/H026266/1","fund-sponsor":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050606512"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050606512?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85050606512&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85050606512&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050606512","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85050606512","eid":"2-s2.0-85050606512","dc:title":"Quaternion based arrival angles and polarization estimation with a cylindrically shaped conformal array","dc:creator":"Zhao F.","prism:publicationName":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Real-Time Computing and Robotics, RCAR 2017","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538620342"}],"prism:volume":"2017-July","prism:pageRange":"483-487","prism:coverDate":"2018-03-09","prism:coverDisplayDate":"9 March 2018","prism:doi":"10.1109/RCAR.2017.8311909","dc:description":"The estimation of direction-of-arrival (DOA) using sensor array has been widely used in radar, wireless communication systems and navigation, the vector sensor array can make full use of the polarization information of the impinging sources.

A novel sparse decomposition algorithm based on the well-known orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) for quaternionic signals was proposed and it was used to solve the question of direction of arrival (DOA) estimation of AVA in small snapshot number, coherent signal source and low signal noise ratio (SNR) case. Compare with the complex field SD algorithm, The results illustrate that the atomic length of the over-complete dictionary is reduced to one-third of that from the long vector model, while errors in DOA estimation are effectively eliminated using the long vector method when the true angles of DOA estimation lie within 1°. Simulation results verify the validity of this algorithm.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007711","afid":"60007711","affilname":"Jilin University","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57824921000","authid":"57824921000","authname":"Zhao Y.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Yang","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35770876900","authid":"35770876900","authname":"Li X.B.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Xin Bo","initials":"X.B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404964763","authid":"7404964763","authname":"Shi Y.W.","surname":"Shi","given-name":"Yao Wu","initials":"Y.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]}],"authkeywords":"Acoustic vector array | Parameters estimation | Quaternion | Sparse decomposition","source-id":"144897","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048623090"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048623090?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85048623090&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85048623090&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048623090","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85048623090","eid":"2-s2.0-85048623090","dc:title":"Quaternion-valued single-phase model for three-phase power system","dc:creator":"Gou X.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Electrical Engineering","prism:issn":"13353632","prism:volume":"69","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"183-186","prism:coverDate":"2018-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 March 2018","prism:doi":"10.2478/jee-2018-0023","dc:description":"In this work, a quaternion-valued model is proposed in lieu of the Clarke's α, β transformation to convert three-phase quantities to a hypercomplex single-phase signal.

The quaternion Fourier transform can be efficiently used to model texture in multidimensional data such as color images. For practical application, multispectral satellite data appear as a primary source for measuring past trends and monitoring changes in forest carbon stocks. In this work, we propose a texture-color descriptor based on the quaternion Fourier transform to extract relevant information from multiband satellite images. We propose a new multiband image texture model extraction, called FOTO++, in order to address biomass estimation issues. The first stage consists in removing noise from the multispectral data while preserving the edges of canopies. Afterward, color texture descriptors are extracted thanks to a discrete form of the quaternion Fourier transform, and finally the support vector regression method is used to deduce biomass estimation from texture indices. Our texture features are modeled using a vector composed with the radial spectrum coming from the amplitude of the quaternion Fourier transform. We conduct several experiments in order to study the sensitivity of our model to acquisition parameters. We also assess its performance both on synthetic images and on real multispectral images of Cameroonian forest. The results show that our model is more robust to acquisition parameters than the classical Fourier Texture Ordination model (FOTO). Our scheme is also more accurate for aboveground biomass estimation. We stress that a similar methodology could be implemented using quaternion wavelets. These results highlight the potential of the quaternion-based approach to study multispectral satellite images.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60157993","afid":"60157993","affilname":"Unité de Modélisation Mathématique et Informatique des Systèmes Complexes","affiliation-city":"Bondy","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001422","afid":"60001422","affilname":"Sorbonne Université","affiliation-city":"Paris","affiliation-country":"France"}],"pubmed-id":"29564667","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201298290","authid":"57201298290","authname":"Djiongo Kenfack C.B.","surname":"Djiongo Kenfack","given-name":"Cedrigue Boris","initials":"C.B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60157993"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001422"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003789416","authid":"7003789416","orcid":"0000-0003-4528-5997","authname":"Monga O.","surname":"Monga","given-name":"Olivier","initials":"O.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60157993"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001422"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189219985","authid":"57189219985","authname":"Mpong S.M.","surname":"Mpong","given-name":"Serge Moto","initials":"S.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60157993"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7801614085","authid":"7801614085","authname":"Ndoundam R.","surname":"Ndoundam","given-name":"René","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60157993"}]}],"authkeywords":"Aboveground biomass | Cameroon | Discrete quaternion Fourier transform | Multiband satellite images | Quaternion-based texture indices","source-id":"12456","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85041749490"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85041749490?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85041749490&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85041749490&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85041749490","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85041749490","eid":"2-s2.0-85041749490","dc:title":"Novel Uncertainty Principles for Two-Sided Quaternion Linear Canonical Transform","dc:creator":"Zhang Y.","prism:publicationName":"Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras","prism:issn":"01887009","prism:eIssn":"16614909","prism:volume":"28","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2018-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 March 2018","prism:doi":"10.1007/s00006-018-0828-0","dc:description":"The uncertainty principle, which offers information about a function and its Fourier transform in the time-frequency plane, is particularly powerful in mathematics, physics and signal processing community.

Generally, blur leads to attenuation of high frequency information and accordingly changes the image energy. Quaternion describes the color information as a whole. Recent researches in quaternion singular value decomposition show that the singular values and singular vectors of the quaternion can capture the distortion of color images, and thus we reasonably suppose that singular values can be utilized to evaluate the sharpness of camera images. Motivated by this, a novel training-free blind quality assessment method considering the integral color information and singular values of the distorted image is proposed to evaluate the sharpness of camera images. The blurred camera image is first converted to LAB color space and divided into blocks. Then pure quaternion is utilized to represent pixels of the blurred camera image and the energy of every block are obtained. Inspired by the human visual system appears to assess image sharpness based on the sharpest region of the image, the local sharpness normalized energy is defined as the sharpness score of the blurred camera image. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed metric compared with popular sharpness image quality metrics.","citedby-count":"13","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60078616","afid":"60078616","affilname":"School of Computer Science and Engineering","affiliation-city":"Singapore City","affiliation-country":"Singapore"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073460","afid":"60073460","affilname":"China University of Mining and Technology","affiliation-city":"Xuzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113311552","afid":"113311552","affilname":"Jiangsu Vocational College of Business","affiliation-city":"Nantong","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190384121","authid":"57190384121","authname":"Tang L.","surname":"Tang","given-name":"Lijuan","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073460"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113311552"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56566919600","authid":"56566919600","authname":"Li Q.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Qiaohong","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60078616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55839736400","authid":"55839736400","authname":"Li L.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Leida","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073460"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55265130000","authid":"55265130000","authname":"Gu K.","surname":"Gu","given-name":"Ke","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60078616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402195789","authid":"7402195789","authname":"Qian J.","surname":"Qian","given-name":"Jiansheng","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073460"}]}],"authkeywords":"Energy | Hypercomplex | Image quality assessment (IQA) | No-reference (NR) | Singular value decomposition (SVD)","source-id":"25627","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61379143","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85046849353"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85046849353?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85046849353&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85046849353&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85046849353","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85046849353","eid":"2-s2.0-85046849353","dc:title":"Trajectory generator for INS/GNSS integration simulation through real flight data interpolation","dc:creator":"Liu K.","prism:publicationName":"Guofang Keji Daxue Xuebao/Journal of National University of Defense Technology","prism:issn":"10012486","prism:volume":"40","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"132-137","prism:coverDate":"2018-02-28","prism:coverDisplayDate":"28 February 2018","prism:doi":"10.11887/j.cn.201801020","dc:description":"An analytic dynamic trajectory generating algorithm based on real flight data interpolation was proposed for INS/GNSS integrated navigation simulation, in order to solve the problem of generating high-precision simulated signals of gyros and accelerometers in a strapdown inertial navigation system. Accurate piecewise analytic expressions of angular rates, angular increments and specific force integral increments in body frame were obtained on the basis of the spline function interpolation for the vehicle's attitude, position and gravity data in the earth centered inertial frame. The simulated signals of gyros and accelerometers were coincident not only with the vehicle's kinematics and dynamic characteristics, but also with the characteristics of post-processed GNSS's pseudo-ranges and their rate measurements. The influence of the lever arm effect of an inertial measurement unit was also simulated. A constrained analytic quaternion interpolation algorithm was proposed under the restrictive condition in which the norm of the interpolated quaternion should be 1. Based on the real flight data of an unmanned aerial vehicle, it is proved that the accuracy and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm can meet the requirements of dynamic simulation of integrated navigation. The algorithm can also be used in other simulations, such as high-precision high-dynamic navigation and rigid body motion control, in which the simulated sensor signals in angular and linear motion are needed.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024350","afid":"60024350","affilname":"National University of Defense Technology China","affiliation-city":"Changsha","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193062700","authid":"57193062700","authname":"Liu K.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Ke","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/18038624300","authid":"18038624300","authname":"Wu W.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Wenqi","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/18233961300","authid":"18233961300","authname":"Tang K.","surname":"Tang","given-name":"Kanghua","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205894834","authid":"57205894834","authname":"Wen K.","surname":"Wen","given-name":"Kun","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024350"}]}],"authkeywords":"Analytic dynamic trajectory generating | INS/GNSS integration navigation | Lever arm effect | Quaternion spline interpolation | Strapdown inertial navigation system","source-id":"14644","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85045309343"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85045309343?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85045309343&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85045309343&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85045309343","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85045309343","eid":"2-s2.0-85045309343","dc:title":"Structure-adaptive vector median filter for impulse noise removal in color images","dc:creator":"Jin L.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - International Conference on Image Processing, ICIP","prism:issn":"15224880","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781509021758"}],"prism:volume":"2017-September","prism:pageRange":"690-694","prism:coverDate":"2018-02-20","prism:coverDisplayDate":"20 February 2018","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2017.8296369","dc:description":"A structure-adaptive vector median filter (SAVMF) for removal of impulse noise from color images is presented in this paper. A color image is represented in quaternion form, and then quaternion Fourier transform is employed to detect the dominant orientation of the pattern in a local neighborhood. Based on the local orientation and its strength, the size, shape and orientation of the support window of vector median filter (VMF) can be adaptively computed, and thus structure-adaptive VMF is implemented. Experimental results exhibit the validity of the proposed method by showing clearly performance improvements both in noise removal and in detail preservation, compared to other VMF-based vector filters.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025761","afid":"60025761","affilname":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15922652500","authid":"15922652500","authname":"Jin L.","surname":"Jin","given-name":"Lianghai","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57199682199","authid":"57199682199","authname":"Jin M.","surname":"Jin","given-name":"Min","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55706250100","authid":"55706250100","authname":"Xu X.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Xangyang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23767272300","authid":"23767272300","authname":"Song E.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Enmin","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image | Impulse noise | Orientation detection | Vector median filter","source-id":"144684","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61370179","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85051261638"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85051261638?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85051261638&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85051261638&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85051261638","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85051261638","eid":"2-s2.0-85051261638","dc:title":"2017 International Automatic Control Conference, CACS 2017","prism:publicationName":"2017 International Automatic Control Conference, CACS 2017","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538639009"}],"prism:volume":"2017-November","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2018-02-07","prism:coverDisplayDate":"7 February 2018","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 47 papers.

It can provide the 3-D motion of a vehicle when no external references (e.g., GPS) are available. The camera-IMU extrinsic calibration parameters can significantly affect the estimation precision when the V-slam algorithm is performed. Because the translation of the camera-IMU sensor can be measured easily manually, the paper is mainly concerned about its attitude parameter. We propose a camera-IMU calibration method which can get the attitude between the camera and IMU. We capture some chessboard images on the ground in different attitudes and different positions of the sensor. The algorithm can achieve the camera-IMU extrinsic calibration parameters with less computation complexity and less time consuming. The experimental results validate the proposed method and qualify its accuracy.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003353","afid":"60003353","affilname":"Harbin Engineering University","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56654542400","authid":"56654542400","authname":"Tao L.","surname":"Tao","given-name":"Liu","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003353"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57200089682","authid":"57200089682","authname":"Hongwang D.","surname":"Hongwang","given-name":"Du","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003353"}]}],"authkeywords":"Camera-IMU calibration | Quaternion | Vision-Aided inertial navigation","source-id":"21100859901","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"51409059","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
