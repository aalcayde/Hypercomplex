We aim to build a US plane localisation system for 3D visualisation, training, and guidance without integrating additional sensors. Methods: We propose a regression convolutional neural network (CNN) using image features to estimate the six-dimensional pose of arbitrarily oriented US planes relative to the fetal brain centre. The network was trained on synthetic images acquired from phantom 3D US volumes and fine-tuned on real scans. Training data was generated by slicing US volumes into imaging planes in Unity at random coordinates and more densely around the standard transventricular (TV) plane. Results: With phantom data, the median errors are 0.90 mm/1.17∘ and 0.44 mm/1.21∘ for random planes and planes close to the TV one, respectively. With real data, using a different fetus with the same gestational age (GA), these errors are 11.84 mm/25.17∘. The average inference time is 2.97 ms per plane. Conclusion: The proposed network reliably localises US planes within the fetal brain in phantom data and successfully generalises pose regression for an unseen fetal brain from a similar GA as in training. Future development will expand the prediction to volumes of the whole fetus and assess its potential for vision-based, freehand US-assisted navigation when acquiring standard fetal planes.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60176024","afid":"60176024","affilname":"UCL Engineering","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024544","afid":"60024544","affilname":"University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022148","afid":"60022148","affilname":"University College London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"pubmed-id":"35489005","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57197797298","authid":"57197797298","orcid":"0000-0002-2853-9791","authname":"Di Vece C.","surname":"Di Vece","given-name":"Chiara","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022148"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60176024"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57220070159","authid":"57220070159","orcid":"0000-0001-9494-9724","authname":"Dromey B.","surname":"Dromey","given-name":"Brian","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022148"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022148"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/47862298300","authid":"47862298300","orcid":"0000-0002-4609-1177","authname":"Vasconcelos F.","surname":"Vasconcelos","given-name":"Francisco","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022148"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60176024"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402605276","authid":"7402605276","orcid":"0000-0002-0199-6140","authname":"David A.L.","surname":"David","given-name":"Anna L.","initials":"A.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022148"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024544"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006889522","authid":"7006889522","orcid":"0000-0001-8562-1970","authname":"Peebles D.","surname":"Peebles","given-name":"Donald","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022148"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024544"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203105770","authid":"57203105770","orcid":"0000-0002-0980-3227","authname":"Stoyanov D.","surname":"Stoyanov","given-name":"Danail","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022148"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60176024"}]}],"authkeywords":"Deep learning | Fetal ultrasound | Pose regression","source-id":"4700152490","fund-acr":"EPSRC","fund-no":"203145/Z/16/Z","fund-sponsor":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherhybridgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Hybrid Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85129174593"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85129174593?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85129174593&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85129174593&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85129174593","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85129174593","eid":"2-s2.0-85129174593","dc:title":"Uncertainties and Design of Active Aerodynamic Attitude Control in Very Low Earth Orbit","dc:creator":"Livadiotti S.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics","prism:issn":"07315090","prism:eIssn":"15333884","prism:volume":"45","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"859-874","prism:coverDate":"2022-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May 2022","prism:doi":"10.2514/1.G005999","dc:description":"This paper discusses the design and the performance achievable with active aerodynamic attitude control in very low Earth orbit, i.e., below 450 km in altitude. A novel real-time algorithm is proposed for selecting the angles of deflection of aerodynamic actuators providing the closest match to the control signal computed by a selected control law. The algorithm is based on a panel method for the computation of the aerodynamic coefficients and relies on approximate environmental parameters estimation and worst-case scenario assumptions for the re-emission properties of space materials. Discussion of results is performed by assuming two representative pointing maneuvers, for which momentum wheels and aerodynamic actuators are used synergistically. A quaternion feedback proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller implemented in discrete time is assumed to determine the control signal at a sampling frequency of 1 Hz. The outcome of a Monte Carlo analysis, performed for a wide range of orbital conditions, shows that the target attitude is successfully achieved for the vast majority of the cases, thus proving the robustness of the approach in the presence of environmental uncertainties and realistic attitude hardware limitations.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true",

singular value decomposition (QSVD) exploits the relationship among different color planes. Hence, it has been applied to the color image denoising. On the other hand, compared to the non-overlapping based image denoising methods, the two dimensional real valued singular spectrum analysis (2DSSA) constructs the trajectory matrix with many elements in the matrix being overlapped. Since the 2DSSA exploits the local information within each color plane, it has also been applied to the single color plane based image denoising. However, neither these two image denoising methods can exploit the relationship among the color planes and the local information within each color plane simultaneously. Therefore, this paper proposes a two dimensional quaternion valued singular spectrum analysis (2DQSSA) based method for performing the color image denoising. Our proposed method can enjoy the advantages of both methods. However, the most critical issue for the 2DQSSA is on the selection of these 2DQSSA components. This paper finds that the optimal total number of the 2DQSSA components used for performing the reconstruction is monotonic decreasing with respect to the power of the noise in the image. Therefore, the polynomial fitting approach is proposed to model this relationship. Since the 2DQSSA based denoising method exploits the relationship among the red color plane, the green color plane and the blue color plane, the 2DQSSA based denoising method outperforms the conventional single color plane based denoising methods.

In particular, the quaternion analytic signal, which is an effective tool in color image processing, can also be produced by quaternion Hardy filtering with specific parameters. Based on the QHF and the improved Di Zenzo gradient operator, a novel color edge detection algorithm is proposed; importantly, it can be efficiently implemented by using the fast discrete quaternion Fourier transform technique. From the experimental results, we conclude that the minimum PSNR improvement rate is 2.3% and the minimum SSIM improvement rate is 30.2% on the CSEE database. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms several widely used algorithms.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60122420","afid":"60122420","affilname":"Shandong University of Finance and Economics","affiliation-city":"Jinan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023237","afid":"60023237","affilname":"Beijing Normal University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219461107","authid":"57219461107","authname":"Bi W.","surname":"Bi","given-name":"Wenshan","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194324445","authid":"57194324445","authname":"Cheng D.","surname":"Cheng","given-name":"Dong","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023237"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57218182246","authid":"57218182246","authname":"Liu W.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Wankai","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122420"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003837546","authid":"7003837546","authname":"Kou K.I.","surname":"Kou","given-name":"Kit Ian","initials":"K.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]}],"authkeywords":"11R52 | 32A36 | 32A40 | Boundary values | color image edge detection | discrete quaternion Fourier transform | quaternion analytic signal","source-id":"24531","fund-acr":"FDCT","fund-no":"2019A1515111185","fund-sponsor":"Fundo para o Desenvolvimento das Ciências e da Tecnologia","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85127850568"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85127850568?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85127850568&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85127850568&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0196890422003867"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85127850568","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85127850568","eid":"2-s2.0-85127850568","dc:title":"Quaternion convolutional long short-term memory neural model with an adaptive decomposition method for wind speed forecasting: North aegean islands case studies","dc:creator":"Neshat M.","prism:publicationName":"Energy Conversion and Management","prism:issn":"01968904","prism:volume":"259","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 May 2022","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.enconman.2022.115590","pii":"S0196890422003867","dc:description":"An accurate prediction of short-term and long-term wind speed is necessary in order to integrate wind energy into large-scale grid power. However, wind speed presents diverse and complex seasonal and stochastic characteristics that impose challenges on wind speed forecasting models. This study proposes a Quaternion Convolutional Neural Network combined with a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory recurrent network to forecast wind speed. Quaternion Convolutional Neural Network is used to elicit more effective features from the stochastic sub-signals of wind speed. A new decomposition method is also proposed, comprising variational mode decomposition to decompose the wind speed data into optimal signal components, and an improved arithmetic optimisation algorithm to optimise the parameters of the variational mode decomposition. Furthermore, a fast and effective hyper-parameters tuner is introduced in order to adjust the hyper-parameters and architecture of the proposed hybrid forecasting model. The proposed forecasting model is developed based on data collected from Lesvos and Samothraki Greek islands located in the North Aegean Sea with the forecasting range in one-day ahead (long-term) and achieved considerable accuracy improvements in these case studies compared with the bi-directional long short-term memory model at 13% and 20%, respectively. The experimental outcomes confirm that, first, the proposed hybrid forecasting model considerably outperforms the five existing machine learning and two hybrid models in terms of precision and stability.","citedby-count":"20","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032350","afid":"60032350","affilname":"Sapienza Università di Roma","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016912","afid":"60016912","affilname":"Yonsei University","affiliation-city":"Seoul","affiliation-country":"South Korea"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/121938343","afid":"121938343","affilname":"Torrens University Australia","affiliation-city":"Brisbane","affiliation-country":"Australia"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25654357600","authid":"25654357600","authname":"Neshat M.","surname":"Neshat","given-name":"Mehdi","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"121938343"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57207201874","authid":"57207201874","authname":"Majidi Nezhad M.","surname":"Majidi Nezhad","given-name":"Meysam","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/51461922300","authid":"51461922300","authname":"Mirjalili S.","surname":"Mirjalili","given-name":"Seyedali","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"121938343"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016912"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219207943","authid":"57219207943","authname":"Piras G.","surname":"Piras","given-name":"Giuseppe","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211258655","authid":"57211258655","authname":"Garcia D.A.","surname":"Garcia","given-name":"Davide Astiaso","initials":"D.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]}],"authkeywords":"Deep learning models | Hyper-parameters tuning | Optimisation algorithms | Quaternion Convolutional neural network | Short-term forecasting | Wind speed","article-number":"115590","source-id":"29372","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85126716404"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85126716404?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85126716404&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85126716404&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85126716404","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85126716404","eid":"2-s2.0-85126716404","dc:title":"Efficient Sound Event Localization and Detection in the Quaternion Domain","dc:creator":"Brignone C.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","prism:issn":"15497747","prism:eIssn":"15583791","prism:volume":"69","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"2453-2457","prism:coverDate":"2022-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 May 2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2022.3160388","dc:description":"In recent years, several approaches have been proposed for the task of Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) with multiple overlapping sound events in the 3D sound field. However, accuracy improvements have been often achieved at the expense of more complex networks and a larger number of parameters. In this brief, we propose an efficient and lightweight Quaternion Temporal Convolutional Network for the SELD task (QSELD-TCN), which combines the advantages of the quaternion-valued processing and the effectiveness of the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). The proposed approach involves a representation of the Ambisonic signal components as a single quaternion and, accordingly, the use of quaternion-valued layers through the whole structure of the neural network. This results in a considerable saving of parameters with respect to the corresponding real-valued model. In particular, a quaternion implementation of the TCN block is presented, exploiting TCN ability in capturing long-term dependencies and the effectiveness of quaternion convolutional layers in grasping correlations among input dimensions. The proposed approach implies less runtime memory and lower storage memory, and it achieves faster inference time with respect to the state-of-the-art methods, making its implementation possible even in devices with limited resources.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032350","afid":"60032350","affilname":"Sapienza Università di Roma","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190246173","authid":"57190246173","orcid":"0000-0003-1624-3747","authname":"Brignone C.","surname":"Brignone","given-name":"Christian","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57537137800","authid":"57537137800","orcid":"0000-0002-2331-2846","authname":"Mancini G.","surname":"Mancini","given-name":"Gioia","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57218250258","authid":"57218250258","orcid":"0000-0003-4626-4506","authname":"Grassucci E.","surname":"Grassucci","given-name":"Eleonora","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005621339","authid":"7005621339","authname":"Uncini A.","surname":"Uncini","given-name":"Aurelio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36444807900","authid":"36444807900","orcid":"0000-0003-4067-4504","authname":"Comminiello D.","surname":"Comminiello","given-name":"Danilo","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032350"}]}],"authkeywords":"efficient neural networks | lightweight neural networks | quaternion domain | Quaternion neural networks | sound event localization and detection","source-id":"9500153930","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85125723783"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85125723783?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85125723783&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85125723783&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85125723783","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85125723783","eid":"2-s2.0-85125723783","dc:title":"New method for bio - signals zero - watermarking using quaternion shmaliy moments and short-time fourier transform","dc:creator":"Daoui A.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","prism:issn":"13807501","prism:eIssn":"15737721","prism:volume":"81","prism:issueIdentifier":"12","prism:pageRange":"17369-17399","prism:coverDate":"2022-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May 2022","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11042-022-12660-2","dc:description":"In this paper, we first present a stable computation of high-order discrete orthonormalized Shmaliy polynomials (SPs).

Such codes correspond to lattices in Mn(C) with dimension smaller than 2n2. Currently, very little is known about their DMT, except in the case m = 1, corresponding to the multiple input single output (MISO) channel. Further, apart from the MISO case, no DMT optimal asymmetric codes are known. We first discuss previous criteria used to analyze the DMT of space-time codes and comment on why these methods fail when applied to asymmetric codes. We then consider two special classes of asymmetric codes where the code-words are restricted to either real or quaternion matrices. We prove two separate diversitymultiplexing gain trade-off (DMT) upper bounds for such codes and provide a criterion for a lattice code to achieve these upper bounds. We also show that lattice codes based on Q-central division algebras satisfy this optimality criterion. As a corollary this result provides a DMT classification for all Q-central division algebra codes that are based on standard embeddings. While the Q-central division algebra based codes achieve the largest possible DMT of a code restricted to either real or quaternion space, they still fall short of the optimal DMT apart from the MISO case.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60103653","afid":"60103653","affilname":"Aalto University","affiliation-city":"Espoo","affiliation-country":"Finland"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002272","afid":"60002272","affilname":"CY Cergy Paris Université","affiliation-city":"Cergy-Pontoise","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14057206300","authid":"14057206300","orcid":"0000-0002-3052-0635","authname":"Vehkalahti R.","surname":"Vehkalahti","given-name":"Roope","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60103653"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25229109200","authid":"25229109200","orcid":"0000-0002-0891-6596","authname":"Luzzi L.","surname":"Luzzi","given-name":"Laura","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002272"}]}],"authkeywords":"algebra | diversity-multiplexing gain trade-off (DMT) | Division algebra | multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) | number theory | space-time block codes (STBCs)","source-id":"15107","fund-acr":"AKA","fund-no":"299916","fund-sponsor":"Academy of Finland","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85102030961"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85102030961?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85102030961&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85102030961&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85102030961","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85102030961","eid":"2-s2.0-85102030961","dc:title":"Quaternion-based image shadow removal","dc:creator":"Murali S.","prism:publicationName":"Visual Computer","prism:issn":"01782789","prism:volume":"38","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"1527-1538","prism:coverDate":"2022-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May 2022","prism:doi":"10.1007/s00371-021-02086-6","dc:description":"Visual effects such as shadows and highlights appear in photographs due to variations in lighting conditions. Although these effects add more meaning to the images, they pose various problems to specific computer vision algorithms. Hence, the removal of shadows and highlights is often considered as a prerequisite to such algorithms. This paper presents an interactive technique for shadow elimination from images. Our method requires user input in the form of rough strokes on the shadow region and its corresponding non-shadow region in the image. We further use quaternion rotation in the YCbCr color space to derive an image that is invariant to shadows. The actual colors of the image are finally recovered by color transfer from the original shadow image. The proposed method takes less time to generate the shadow-free image and does not necessitate the detection of shadows prior to its removal. Also, unlike the existing shadow-removal techniques, our method generates invariant image with minor texture loss. Experimental findings are reported to demonstrate the performance of our shadow-removal technique.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013170","afid":"60013170","affilname":"National Institute of Technology Calicut","affiliation-city":"Kozhikode","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55532097800","authid":"55532097800","orcid":"0000-0002-6778-6138","authname":"Murali S.","surname":"Murali","given-name":"Saritha","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013170"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23984618100","authid":"23984618100","authname":"Govindan V.K.","surname":"Govindan","given-name":"V.

In the applications, the performance of LCT is superior because of its three extra degrees of freedom as compared to no degree of freedom for FT and one degree of freedom for FrFT. Recently, quaternion linear canonical transform (QLCT), an extension of the LCT in quaternion algebra, has been derived and since received noticeable attention, thanks to its elegance and expressive power in the study of multi-dimensional signals/images. To the best of our knowledge computation of the QLCT by using digital techniques is not possible now, because a discrete version of the QLCT is undefined. It initiated us to introduce the two-dimensional (2D) discrete quaternion linear canonical transform (DQLCT) that is analogous to the 2D discrete quaternion Fourier transform (DQFT). The main properties of the 2D DQLCT, including the basic properties, reconstruction formula and Rayleigh-Plancherel theorem, are obtained. Importantly, the convolution theorem and fast computation algorithm of 2D DQLCT, which are key to engineering usage, are considered. Finally, we demonstrate applications, illustrate simulations, and discuss some future prospects of the DQLCT.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016835","afid":"60016835","affilname":"Beijing Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016300","afid":"60016300","affilname":"University of Kashmir","affiliation-city":"Srinagar","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/109458529","afid":"109458529","affilname":"Beijing Key Laboratory of Fractional Signals and Systems","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192154748","authid":"57192154748","orcid":"0000-0001-6261-5586","authname":"Urynbassarova D.","surname":"Urynbassarova","given-name":"Didar","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"109458529"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57213148331","authid":"57213148331","authname":"Teali A.A.","surname":"Teali","given-name":"Aajaz A.","initials":"A.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016300"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56431563100","authid":"56431563100","authname":"Zhang F.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Feng","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"109458529"}]}],"authkeywords":"Discrete linear canonical transform | Fast algorithm | Filtering | Quaternion Fourier transform | Quaternion linear canonical transform","article-number":"103361","source-id":"24306","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"62171025","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85128724185"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85128724185?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85128724185&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85128724185&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85128724185","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85128724185","eid":"2-s2.0-85128724185","dc:title":"New Sampling Expansion Related to Derivatives in Quaternion Fourier Transform Domain","dc:creator":"Saima S.","prism:publicationName":"Mathematics","prism:eIssn":"22277390","prism:volume":"10","prism:issueIdentifier":"8","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April-2 2022","prism:doi":"10.3390/math10081217","dc:description":"The theory of quaternions has gained a firm ground in recent times and is being widely explored, with the field of signal and image processing being no exception.

In the present article, our aim is to formulate the GSE in the realm of a one-dimensional quaternion Fourier transform. We have designed quaternion Fourier filters to reconstruct the signal, using the signal and its derivative. Since derivatives contain information about the edges and curves appearing in images, therefore, such a sampling formula is of substantial importance for image processing, particularly in image super-resolution procedures.

The QSA calculates the quaternion rotation and applies statistics such as mean, variance, kurtosis, skewness, standard deviation, root mean square, and shape factor to obtain their features. After that, four classification algorithms are applied to predict motor states. The results of the QSA method are validated for ten classes: four single classes (healthy condition, unbalanced pulley, bearing fault, and half-broken bar) and six combined classes. The proposed method achieves high accuracy and performance compared to similar works in the state of the art.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033291","afid":"60033291","affilname":"Universidad de Guanajuato","affiliation-city":"Guanajuato","affiliation-country":"Mexico"}],"pubmed-id":"35408236","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57207110899","authid":"57207110899","authname":"Contreras-Hernandez J.L.","surname":"Contreras-Hernandez","given-name":"Jose L.","initials":"J.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033291"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13608761000","authid":"13608761000","authname":"Almanza-Ojeda D.L.","surname":"Almanza-Ojeda","given-name":"Dora L.","initials":"D.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033291"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55639546600","authid":"55639546600","authname":"Ledesma S.","surname":"Ledesma","given-name":"Sergio","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033291"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24450208500","authid":"24450208500","authname":"Garcia-Perez A.","surname":"Garcia-Perez","given-name":"Arturo","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033291"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6508110285","authid":"6508110285","authname":"Castro-Sanchez R.","surname":"Castro-Sanchez","given-name":"Rogelio","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033291"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8363996900","authid":"8363996900","authname":"Gomez-Martinez M.A.","surname":"Gomez-Martinez","given-name":"Miguel A.","initials":"M.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033291"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15837259000","authid":"15837259000","authname":"Ibarra-Manzano M.A.","surname":"Ibarra-Manzano","given-name":"Mario A.","initials":"M.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033291"}]}],"authkeywords":"induction motors | machine learning comparison | motor fault detection | quaternion signal analysis","article-number":"2622","source-id":"130124","fund-acr":"UG","fund-no":"POA 2022","fund-sponsor":"Universidad de Guanajuato","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85123506426"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85123506426?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85123506426&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85123506426&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85123506426","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85123506426","eid":"2-s2.0-85123506426","dc:title":"Short-time special affine Fourier transform for quaternion-valued functions","dc:creator":"Srivastava H.M.","prism:publicationName":"Revista de la Real Academia de Ciencias Exactas, Fisicas y Naturales - Serie A: Matematicas","prism:issn":"15787303","prism:eIssn":"15791505","prism:volume":"116","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2022","prism:doi":"10.1007/s13398-022-01210-y","dc:description":"The special affine Fourier transform is a promising tool for analyzing transient signals with more degrees of freedom via a chirp-like basis.

Recent improvements have assisted in resolving the rank minimization issue, thereby promoting the realization of completion. This paper adopts the new quaternion matrix logarithmic norm to approximate rank in accordance with the quaternion matrix framework. Unlike the traditional matrix completion method, which handles RGB channels separately, the quaternion-based method avoids the destruction of the structure of images by placing the color image in a pure quaternion matrix. Furthermore, the logarithmic norm induces a more accurate rank surrogate. Based on the logarithmic norm, it is possible to exploit not only the factorization strategy but also the truncated technique, thus achieving successful image restoration. The alternating minimization framework renders it possible to optimize the two strategies, and mathematically detailed validation of the convergence analysis is provided. The experimental results demonstrate that the use of logarithmic surrogates in the quaternion domain is a superior strategy for solving the problem of color image completion.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222070456","authid":"57222070456","authname":"Yang L.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Liqiao","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201452670","authid":"57201452670","authname":"Miao J.","surname":"Miao","given-name":"Jifei","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003837546","authid":"7003837546","authname":"Kou K.I.","surname":"Kou","given-name":"Kit Ian","initials":"K.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]}],"authkeywords":"Image completion | Logarithmic norm | Low rank | Quaternion matrix","source-id":"15134","fund-acr":"STDF","fund-no":"FDCT/085/2018/A2","fund-sponsor":"Science and Technology Development Fund","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85120969341"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85120969341?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85120969341&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85120969341&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0888327021010013"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85120969341","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85120969341","eid":"2-s2.0-85120969341","dc:title":"A novel Lanczos quaternion singular spectrum analysis method and its application to bevel gear fault diagnosis with multi-channel signals","dc:creator":"Ma Y.","prism:publicationName":"Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing","prism:issn":"08883270","prism:eIssn":"10961216","prism:volume":"168","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 April 2022","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.ymssp.2021.108679","pii":"S0888327021010013","dc:description":"Multi-channel signals collected by multiple sensors contain more operating information than single-channel signal, so multi-channel signal processing method can improve confidence level and accuracy of fault diagnosis. Multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) is the most widely used multi-channel signal method, however, it has the problem of mode mixing. Quaternion singular spectrum analysis (QSSA) is an effective multi-channel signal denoising method with three defects. It needs huge calculation time, the contribution of irrelevant components exists in selected singular values, and the obtained denoising signal derives from certain single-channel signal. Hence, a novel multi-channel signal processing method called Lanczos quaternion singular spectrum analysis (LQSSA) is proposed in this paper. First, LQSSA uses Lanczos method during the decomposition of the proposed method, which reduces the calculation time greatly. Then, filter value factor is obtained by introducing Lagrange multiplier to suppress the contribution of the irrelevant components and improve the purity of required signal. Finally, periodic similarity is used to obtain Lanczos quaternion singular spectrum components (LQSSCs) by taking the signal components as a whole, so it breaks the restriction between different channels. The proposed method is applied to simulated signals and experimental signals of bevel gear, and the analysis results show that the proposed method can extract the fault characteristic frequency from the multi-channel signals effectively.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032356","afid":"60032356","affilname":"Hunan University","affiliation-city":"Changsha","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/121984863","afid":"121984863","affilname":"AECC Key Laboratory of Aero-engine Vibration Technology","affiliation-city":"Zhuzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/118358754","afid":"118358754","affilname":"AECC Hunan Aviation Powerplant Research Institute","affiliation-city":"Zhuzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222188966","authid":"57222188966","authname":"Ma Y.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Yanli","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8849330300","authid":"8849330300","authname":"Cheng J.","surname":"Cheng","given-name":"Junsheng","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57212379384","authid":"57212379384","authname":"Wang P.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Ping","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"118358754"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"121984863"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206679003","authid":"57206679003","authname":"Wang J.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Jian","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"118358754"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"121984863"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7409385350","authid":"7409385350","authname":"Yang Y.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Yu","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"}]}],"authkeywords":"Bevel gear | Fault diagnosis | Lanczos quaternion singular spectrum analysis | Multi-channel signals","article-number":"108679","source-id":"21080","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"51875183","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85105857049"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85105857049?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85105857049&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85105857049&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85105857049","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85105857049","eid":"2-s2.0-85105857049","dc:title":"Mounting Parameter Estimation from Velocity Vector Observations for Land Vehicle Navigation","dc:creator":"Zhang Q.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","prism:issn":"02780046","prism:eIssn":"15579948","prism:volume":"69","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"4234-4244","prism:coverDate":"2022-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 April 2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/TIE.2021.3075883","dc:description":"A velocity model composing speed sensors and motion constraints is used as the direct and effective auxiliary information of global navigation satellite system (GNSS)/inertial navigation system integrated systems to improve the land vehicle navigation accuracy under interfered or blocked GNSS signal environments. The precise determination of the mounting parameter (the geometric relationship between sensors), including mounting angle and lever arm, is necessary to realize the full potential of velocity assistance. In this article, we propose an optimal mounting parameter estimation scheme based on the velocity vector observations. The quaternion-based optimal attitude determination method is used to estimate the mounting angle, and the weighted recursive least squares are applied to estimate the lever arm. A land vehicle test and an agricultural tractor test are carried out to verify the feasibility and correctness, and inertial measurement units (IMUs) of different grades, especially the micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) IMUs, are used. The results show that the attitude errors, especially the heading error, are the main factors influencing mounting angle estimation and that the statistical lateral velocity based on the estimated mounting parameters is better than 0.03 m/s, thus better satisfying vehicle motion constraints.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029306","afid":"60029306","affilname":"Wuhan University","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/121236654","afid":"121236654","affilname":"Qianxun Spatial Intelligence Inc.","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55358271400","authid":"55358271400","orcid":"0000-0002-6918-9935","authname":"Zhang Q.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Quan","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029306"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029306"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57218710556","authid":"57218710556","authname":"Hu Y.","surname":"Hu","given-name":"Yuanqian","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"121236654"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57213194672","authid":"57213194672","authname":"Li S.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Shanshan","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"121236654"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/53664713800","authid":"53664713800","authname":"Zhang T.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Tisheng","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029306"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029306"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9241611900","authid":"9241611900","orcid":"0000-0002-5591-0859","authname":"Niu X.","surname":"Niu","given-name":"Xiaoji","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029306"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029306"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude determination | land vehicle navigation | MEMS inertial measurement unit (IMU) | mounting angle | velocity model","source-id":"26053","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85131191650"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85131191650?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85131191650&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85131191650&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85131191650","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85131191650","eid":"2-s2.0-85131191650","dc:title":"Inverse Dynamics of Six-axis Accelerometers Based on Parallel Mechanisms","dc:creator":"You J.","prism:publicationName":"Jixie Gongcheng Xuebao/Journal of Mechanical Engineering","prism:issn":"05776686","prism:volume":"58","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"10-25","prism:coverDate":"2022-03-20","prism:coverDisplayDate":"20 March 2022","prism:doi":"10.3901/JME.2022.06.010","dc:description":"Six-axis accelerometers can measure the spatial accelerations of moving carriers, which have broad applications in the fields of artificial intelligence and the like. The inverse dynamics of this type of system has not yet been resolved due to the strong nonlinear coupling between multiple inputs and multiple outputs. Taking the six-axis accelerometers based on \"12-6\" and \"9-3\" configuration parallel mechanisms as examples, their inverse kinetic equations are derived and solved in the phase space by introducing quaternion matrices and a cross product operation rule related to the fourth-order vectors. Based on these, the relations between the numerical behavior and influencing factors of the equations are revealed. The study found that: the equations are more effective when the relative motion parameters between the mass and the base are ignored; the solution accuracies of the equations are related to the topological configurations of the elastic bodies, the frequencies of the measured signal, the sampling frequency ratios and the sampling time; when the sampling frequencies are less than 60kHz, the solution efficiencies of the equations meet the real-time requirements. Next, the minimum eigenvalues of the stiffness matrices of the two configurations are solved by combining the virtual power principle and the characteristic length method. The root cause of the relations between the elastic body topologies and the accuracies of the equation solutions is found, which provides the theoretical guidance for the configuration synthesis of multi-dimensional sensors. Further, in view of the fact that the accelerations are invalid when there are small or large disturbance in the equations, the corresponding error compensation and fault restoration algorithms are constructed by monitoring the rotation direction alternate point of the base and establishing a compatibility closed chain in terms of the input, respectively. The measurement errors of the physical prototypes of the two configurations can be controlled within 5.822% and 6.781% respectively, both of which meet the real-time request, verifying that the inverse dynamic model is effective and reliable.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143","afid":"60064143","affilname":"Nanjing University of Information Science &amp; Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025665","afid":"60025665","affilname":"Nanjing Forestry University","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021666","afid":"60021666","affilname":"Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36706818800","authid":"36706818800","authname":"You J.","surname":"You","given-name":"Jingjing","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025665"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57217228375","authid":"57217228375","authname":"Wang L.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Linkang","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025665"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36158490900","authid":"36158490900","authname":"Liu Y.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Yunping","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56106032400","authid":"56106032400","authname":"Li C.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Chenggang","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021666"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9636573600","authid":"9636573600","authname":"Wu H.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Hongtao","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021666"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021666"}]}],"authkeywords":"Inverse dynamics | Parallel mechanism | Phase space | Quaternion | Six-axis accelerometer | Stiffness","source-id":"20948","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85148259959"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85148259959?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85148259959&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85148259959&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85148259959","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85148259959","eid":"2-s2.0-85148259959","dc:title":"Invisibility","dc:creator":"Lefevre P.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Security 1: Authentication and Data Hiding","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781119901808"}],"prism:pageRange":"129-160","prism:coverDate":"2022-03-04","prism:coverDisplayDate":"4 March 2022","prism:doi":"10.1002/9781119901808.ch4","dc:description":"This chapter discusses the different strategies to ensure the invisibility of a message embedded in a color image.

The chapter examines the different steps of a robust watermarking scenario for color images, as well as the algorithms used to adapt the index modulation Lattice method. Quaternions can be a tool to manipulate color, which explains the different works offering quaternion-based watermarking. The chapter discusses a psychovisual model that makes the choice of direction as adaptive as possible, that is, it shows how to determine the optimal direction vectors for any RGB color.

We show that the quaternionic bandlimited functions can be reconstructed from their samples as well as the samples of their derivatives and Hilbert transforms. In addition, the relationships among different types of sampling formulas under various transforms are discussed. First, if the quaternionic function is bandlimited to a rectangle that is symmetric about the origin, then the sampling formulas under various quaternion Fourier transforms are identical. If this rectangle is not symmetric about the origin, then the sampling formulas under various quaternion Fourier transforms are different from each other. Second, using the relationship between the two-sided quaternion Fourier transform and the linear canonical transform, we derive sampling formulas under various quaternion linear canonical transforms. Third, truncation errors of these sampling formulas are estimated. Finally, some simulations are provided to show how the sampling formulas can be used in applications.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60122342","afid":"60122342","affilname":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University","affiliation-city":"Wenzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023237","afid":"60023237","affilname":"Beijing Normal University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191711035","authid":"57191711035","orcid":"0000-0003-1866-0413","authname":"Hu X.","surname":"Hu","given-name":"Xiaoxiao","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122342"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194324445","authid":"57194324445","authname":"Cheng D.","surname":"Cheng","given-name":"Dong","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023237"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003837546","authid":"7003837546","orcid":"0000-0003-1924-9087","authname":"Kou K.I.","surname":"Kou","given-name":"Kit Ian","initials":"K.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]}],"authkeywords":"Generalized quaternion partial and total Hilbert transforms | O236 | Quaternion Fourier transforms | Quaternion linear canonical transforms | Quaternion partial and total Hilbert transforms | Sampling theorem | Truncation errors","source-id":"21100409130","fund-acr":"WMU","fund-no":"2019A1515111185","fund-sponsor":"Wenzhou Medical University","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85123847598"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85123847598?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85123847598&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85123847598&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85123847598","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85123847598","eid":"2-s2.0-85123847598","dc:title":"Efficient color face recognition based on quaternion discrete orthogonal moments neural networks","dc:creator":"El Alami A.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","prism:issn":"13807501","prism:eIssn":"15737721","prism:volume":"81","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"7685-7710","prism:coverDate":"2022-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"March 2022","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11042-021-11669-3","dc:description":"In recent years, with the rapid development of multimedia technologies, color face recognition has attracted more attention in various areas related to the computer vision. Extracting pertinent features from color image is a challenging problem due to the lack of efficient descriptors. Many methods in literature have been reported. However, some inconveniences arising from these methods are: insufficient color information and time consuming for features extraction. In this paper, a new model quaternion discrete orthogonal moments neural networks (QDOMNN) is proposed to improve the accuracy of color face recognition. The quaternion representation is used to represent color image in a holistic manner instead of monochromatic intensity information. Furthermore, the discrete orthogonal moments are used to extract compact and pertinent features from quaternion representation of image. The main purpose of the utilization of quaternion discrete orthogonal moments is to reduce the number of parameters in the input vector of the model, and consequently decreasing the computational time of training process, while improving the classification rate. The performance of our model is evaluated on some face databases, we obtain 100% as classification accuracy on faces94, grimace and GT, 91.93% on FEI, more than 94.72% on faces95 and more than 98.01% on faces96. Experiment results show the outperformance of our model (QDOMNN) against other existing methods in terms of classification rate, and robustness in noisy conditions.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019337","afid":"60019337","affilname":"Mohammed V University in Rabat","affiliation-city":"Rabat","affiliation-country":"Morocco"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017021","afid":"60017021","affilname":"Université Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah","affiliation-city":"Fez","affiliation-country":"Morocco"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57207620611","authid":"57207620611","orcid":"0000-0002-2489-661X","authname":"El Alami A.","surname":"El Alami","given-name":"Abdelmajid","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017021"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209135926","authid":"57209135926","authname":"Berrahou N.","surname":"Berrahou","given-name":"Nadia","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017021"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194200184","authid":"57194200184","authname":"Lakhili Z.","surname":"Lakhili","given-name":"Zouhir","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017021"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202669582","authid":"57202669582","authname":"Mesbah A.","surname":"Mesbah","given-name":"Abderrahim","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019337"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35772551600","authid":"35772551600","authname":"Berrahou A.","surname":"Berrahou","given-name":"Aissam","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019337"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12144280900","authid":"12144280900","authname":"Qjidaa H.","surname":"Qjidaa","given-name":"Hassan","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017021"}]}],"authkeywords":"Classification | Color face recognition | Neural networks | Noisy conditions | Quaternion discrete orthogonal moments | Quaternion representation | Time consuming","source-id":"25627","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
