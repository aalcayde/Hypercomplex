The aim of the study is to investigate control systems, i. e. , the form of functional relationships OMEGA //k which would ensure the execution of the correction process. Kinematic parameters by Rodrigues-Hamilton which are quaternion components are used in this study. It is shown that these components can be directly used in the capacity of control signals and that quaternions are convenient as parameters in the investigation of the correction process stability.","citedby-count":"7","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602787548","authid":"6602787548","authname":"Branets V.","surname":"Branets","given-name":"V.
