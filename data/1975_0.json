Complex cells were most affected, increasing both evoked and spontaneous activity and losing some of their specificities for stimulus parameters such as orientation and direction. Hypercomplex cells lost their inhibitory flanks, responding equally well to long and short bars after the drug. Simple cells were the least affected, usually becoming somewhat depressed after the drug. Preliminary tests with another inhibitory amino acid antagonist, strychnine, showed that it excited simple cells, indicating that possibly more than one inhibitory transmitter is at work in the cortex. The results are discussed with relation to the synaptic anatomy of the cortex, and it is concluded that a class of stellate cells, using GABA, is a likely candidate for the transmitter of some intracortical inhibition. © 1975.","citedby-count":"26","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031581","afid":"60031581","affilname":"California Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Pasadena","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"pubmed-id":"166731","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202377103","authid":"7202377103","authname":"Daniels J.","surname":"Daniels","given-name":"J.

This analysis begins in the retina and is continued as the information is passed on via the optic nerves to the lateral geniculate nucleus and from there to the visual cortex. All neurons investigated so far have been found to be influenced by rather circumscribed areas of the retina. Such an area is called the receptive field of that particular neuron. Receptive fields are usually not homogenous. For instance, the retinal ganglion cells, that is the cell bodies of the optic nerve fibres, have round fields with a centre that influences cell activity in the opposite way to that of the periphery. These cells are also concerned about the contrast in illumination between this region and its surroundings. In this way the original message is already altered in the retina. In the visual cortex of the brain, information coming from many ganglion cells is conveyed, via the geniculate, on so called simple cells in such a way that their receptive fields are oblong. Simple cells, therefore, discriminate orientation in addition to contrast. Simple cells project to complex cells in such a way that their receptive fields are sensitive to oriented stimuli but only if these are moving. Complex cells project to hypercomplex cells which are even more specialized to detect certain forms of moving stimuli, like wedges or angles. The complex pattern of neural activity extracted from the input is constructively correlated to appropriate eye movements.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019722","afid":"60019722","affilname":"Technische Universität München","affiliation-city":"Munich","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603412457","authid":"6603412457","authname":"Ruedel R.","surname":"Ruedel","given-name":"R.","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019722"}]}],"source-id":"23458","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0016670206"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0016670206?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0016670206&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0016670206&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0016670206","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0016670206","eid":"2-s2.0-0016670206","dc:title":"Receptive fields of single cells and topography in mouse visual cortex","dc:creator":"Dräger U.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Comparative Neurology","prism:issn":"00219967","prism:eIssn":"10969861","prism:volume":"160","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"269-289","prism:coverDate":"1975-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 April 1975","prism:doi":"10.1002/cne.901600302","dc:description":"The visual cortex was studied in the mouse (C57 Black/6J strain) by recording from single units, and a topographic map of the visual field was constructed. Forty‐five percent of the neurons in striate cortex responded best to oriented line stimuli moving over their receptive fields; they were classified as simple (17%), complex (25%) and hypercomplex (3%). Of all preferred orientations horizontal was most common. Fifty‐five percent of receptive fields were cicularly symmetric: these were on‐center (25%), off‐center (7%) and homogeneous on‐off in type (23%). Optimal stimulus velocities were much higher than those reported in the cat, mostly varying between 20° and 300°/sec. The field of vision common to the two eyes projected to more than one‐third of the striate cortex. Although the contralateral eye provided the dominating influence on cells in this binocular area, more than two‐thirds of cells could also be driven through the ipsilateral eye. The topography of area 17 was similar to that found in other mammals: the upper visual field projected posteriorly, the most nasal part mapped onto the lateral border. Here the projection did not end at the vertical meridian passing through the animal's long axis, but proceeded for at least 10° into the ipsilateral hemifield of vision, so that at least 20° of visual field were represented in both hemispheres. The magnification in area 17 was rather uniform throughout the visual field. In an area latral to area 17 (18a) the fields were projected in condensed mirror image fashion with respect to the arrangement of area 17. Medial to area 17 a third visual area (area 18) was again related to 17 as a condensed mirror image.
