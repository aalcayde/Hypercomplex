Their definitions are based on the proposed general n-D form of the Cauchy integral. The definitions are presented in signaland frequency domains. The new notion of lower rank signals is introduced. It is shown that starting with the 3-D analytic hypercomplex signals and decreasing their rank by extending the support in the frequency-space to a so called space quadrant, we get a signal having the quaternionic structure. The advantage of this procedure is demonstrated in the context of the polar representation of 3-D hypercomplex signals. Some new reconstruction formulas are presented.

The bias of gyros and accelerometers are tracked by a state estimation algorithm in real-time. The algorithm uses characteristics of the sensor noise to automatically recognize motionless periods and update the sensor's bias level without any dependency on application specific parameters, frequency separation between the signal of interest and the sensor noise, or a high-level system model. Then the attitude estimation algorithm that fuses data from rate gyros and accelerometers is proposed. Based on the kinematics of the body and the Newton's force law, the modified Rodrigues parameter is represented in place of quaternion. We describe rotation without encountering singularity between the modified Rodrigues parameters and their shadow parameters. And the attitude is estimated by Extended Kalman filter under low acceleration, meanwhile the situation of high acceleration is considered. Finally, the proposed estimation algorithm is tested, the simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2011 IEEE.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013789","afid":"60013789","affilname":"Beihang University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/45261056300","authid":"45261056300","authname":"Fang B.","surname":"Fang","given-name":"Bin","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013789"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202273063","authid":"7202273063","authname":"Chou W.","surname":"Chou","given-name":"Wusheng","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013789"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58444225700","authid":"58444225700","authname":"Ding L.","surname":"Ding","given-name":"Li","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013789"}]}],"authkeywords":"attitude estimation | bias | Extended Kalman filter | MEMS inertial sensors","article-number":"5750687","source-id":"19800188034","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79551484008"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79551484008?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=79551484008&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=79551484008&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S016516841000438X"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79551484008","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:79551484008","eid":"2-s2.0-79551484008","dc:title":"Color impulsive noise removal based on quaternion representation and directional vector order-statistics","dc:creator":"Jin L.","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing","prism:issn":"01651684","prism:volume":"91","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"1249-1261","prism:coverDate":"2011-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May 2011","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.sigpro.2010.12.011","pii":"S016516841000438X","dc:description":"A new method for detecting and suppressing impulsive noise in color images is presented in this paper.

Image authentication is done by hiding secrete message/image into the transformed frequency component of source image. The DFT is applied on sub-image block called mask of size 2 × 2 in row major order. Secrete message/image bit is fabricated within the transformed real frequency component of each source image byte except the first frequency component of each mask. After embedding, a delicate re-adjust phase is incorporated in the first frequency component of each mask, to keep the quantum value positive and non fractional in spatial domain. Robustness is achieved by hiding an authenticating or secrete message/image in the frequency component with positive and negatives both quantum values and invisibility is satisfied in spatial domain using delicate re-adjust phase. Inverse DFT (IDFT) is performed after embedding to transform embedded image in frequency domain to spatial domain. Experimental results conform that the proposed algorithm performs better than discrete cosine transformation and Quaternion Fourier Transformation based scheme. © 2011 IEEE.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011023","afid":"60011023","affilname":"University of Kalyani","affiliation-city":"Kalyani","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005006672","authid":"7005006672","authname":"Ghoshal N.","surname":"Ghoshal","given-name":"Nabin","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011023"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24605629500","authid":"24605629500","authname":"Mandal J.","surname":"Mandal","given-name":"J.

Local variance distribution of luminance layer is calculated. Color information is taken into account by using quaternion matrix. The description method is a combination of luminance layer and color information. The angle between the singular value feature vectors of the quaternion matrices corresponding to the reference image and the distorted image is used to measure the structural similarity of the two color images. When the reference image and distorted images are of unequal size it can also assess their quality. Results from experiments show that the proposed method is better consistent with the human visual characteristics than MSE, PSNR and MSSIM. The resized distorted images can also be assessed rationally by this method.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027363","afid":"60027363","affilname":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004828","afid":"60004828","affilname":"Changchun Institute of Optics Fine Mechanics and Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203768643","authid":"57203768643","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yuqing","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9238980500","authid":"9238980500","authname":"Zhu M.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Ming","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35234570300","authid":"35234570300","authname":"Pang H.","surname":"Pang","given-name":"Haochen","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56790197500","authid":"56790197500","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"}]}],"authkeywords":"color image | local variance | Quality assessment | quaternion | singular value decomposition","source-id":"21100869464","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79959731612"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79959731612?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=79959731612&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=79959731612&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79959731612","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:79959731612","eid":"2-s2.0-79959731612","dc:title":"Edge detection of colour image based on quaternion fractional differential","dc:creator":"Gao C.B.","prism:publicationName":"IET Image Processing","prism:issn":"17519659","prism:volume":"5","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"261-272","prism:coverDate":"2011-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2011","prism:doi":"10.1049/iet-ipr.2009.0409","dc:description":"According to the development of the real fractional differential and its applications in the modern signal processing, the authors extend it to quaternion body and put forward a new concept: quaternion fractional differential (QFD), and apply it to edge detection of colour image.

In this algorithm, the attitude quaternion of stellar sensor and the output of fiber optical gyroscope were imported into a nonlinear empirical mode predictive algorithm to extract the drift component of gyroscope.

The principal component analysis (PCA) is a successful approach because of its effective extraction of the global feature and excellent reconstruction of face image. However, the crucial shortcomings of PCA are its low recognition rate and overfitting of feature extraction which leads to the dependence of training data on training samples. In this paper, a modified two-dimension principal component analysis (2DPCA) and bidirectional principal component analysis (BDPCA) methods based on quaternion matrix are proposed to recognize and reconstruct a color face image. In these methods, the spatial distribution information of color images is used to represent a color face, and the 2DPCA or BDPCA feature of color face image is extracted by reducing the dimensionality in both column and row directions. A method obtaining orthogonal eigenvector set of quaternion matrix is proposed. Numerous experiments show that the present approach based on quaternion matrix can effectively smooth the overfitting issue and substantially enhance the recognition rate. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We first use a quaternion function to color image and give the definition and calculation method of the quaternion fractional directional derivative. Then, we deduce their numerical calculation templates along eight directions. According to the fractional directional differentiation along the eight directions, the maximum of the norm of quaternion fractional directional differentiation for every point in the image plane is found, then this maximum as the pixel value of this point is viewed, and the enhanced image is obtained. Experimental results show that our method can greatly increase high frequency, reinforce medium frequency, and non-linearly preserve low frequency of signals, hence it is superior to those based on the traditional methods of differentiation in visual effects.

First, we introduce a novel quaternionic Gabor filter (QGF) which can combine the color channels and the orientations in the image plane. We show that these filters are optimally localized both in the spatial and frequency domains and provide a good approximation to quaternionic quadrature filters. Using the QGFs, we extract the local orientation information in the color images. Second, in order to model this derived orientation information, we propose continuous mixtures of appropriate exponential basis functions and derive analytic expressions for these models. These analytic expressions take the form of spatially varying kernels which, when convolved with a color image or the signed distance function of an evolving contour (placed in the color image), yield a detail preserving smoothing and segmentation, respectively. Several examples on widely used image databases are shown to depict the performance of our algorithms. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","citedby-count":"97","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013959","afid":"60013959","affilname":"University of Florida","affiliation-city":"Gainesville","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24823484600","authid":"24823484600","authname":"Subakan O.","surname":"Subakan","given-name":"Özlem N.","initials":"O.N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013959"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005889271","authid":"7005889271","authname":"Vemuri B.","surname":"Vemuri","given-name":"Baba C.","initials":"B.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013959"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image segmentation | Color image smoothing | Continuous mixture models | Directional distributions | Matrix-Fisher distribution | Quaternion Gabor filter | Quaternions | von Mises distribution | Watson distribution","source-id":"72242","fund-acr":"NSF","fund-no":"0920145","fund-sponsor":"National Science Foundation","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77957974627"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77957974627?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77957974627&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77957974627&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0031320310004036"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77957974627","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:77957974627","eid":"2-s2.0-77957974627","dc:title":"Quaternion FourierMellin moments for color images","dc:creator":"Guo L.","prism:publicationName":"Pattern Recognition","prism:issn":"00313203","prism:volume":"44","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"187-195","prism:coverDate":"2011-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"February 2011","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.patcog.2010.08.017","pii":"S0031320310004036","dc:description":"The quaternion FourierMellin moments for describing color images are introduced, which can be seen as the generalization of traditional FourierMellin moments for gray-level images.

Brain function originates in the precise integration of activities of different neural structures. The peculiar richness of the brain's integrative output is dependent upon the development of multiple anatomical subregions, each having cytological and functional specificity. This requires stringent developmental patterning in space and time of the molecular and cellular processes that build up the hypercomplex structure of the brain. A delicate balance between spatio-temporal sequences of gene expression regulates normal brain development, forming a complex causal network. It reviews the cartography of genes which is known to represent key factors for brain development in the neural tube, focusing mainly on those that code for morphogenetic information: signaling molecules and transcription factors. The neuroepithelium of the neural plate and tube contains the progenitors for the neural cells—neurons and glia—that will jointly form operative brain structures. Cells at different initial domains of these primordia receive multiple morphogenetic positional signals, encoded by graded distribution of signaling molecules produced at restricted sites within or outside the developmental field. These signals act upon specific receptors expressed in the neuroepithelial cells and regulate at each locus the expression of a specific set of transcription factors controlling proliferation, neurogenesis, and cellular differentiation and eventually, the emergence of connections and functional properties.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017107","afid":"60017107","affilname":"CSIC-UMH - Instituto de Neurociencias (IN)","affiliation-city":"San Juan de Alicante","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book","subtype":"ch","subtypeDescription":"Book Chapter","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202228062","authid":"7202228062","authname":"Martínez S.","surname":"Martínez","given-name":"Salvador","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017107"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6507650105","authid":"6507650105","authname":"Puelles E.","surname":"Puelles","given-name":"Eduardo","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017107"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55152408700","authid":"55152408700","authname":"Puelles L.","surname":"Puelles","given-name":"Luis","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017107"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8791348900","authid":"8791348900","authname":"Echevarria D.","surname":"Echevarria","given-name":"Diego","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017107"}]}],"source-id":"21101132491","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85024821741"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85024821741?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85024821741&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85024821741&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85024821741","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85024821741","eid":"2-s2.0-85024821741","dc:title":"TH‐C‐220‐09: High Resolution Image‐Guided Irradiation of Murine Brain Tumors Using the Gamma Knife Perfexion Treatment Unit","dc:creator":"Drzymala R.","prism:publicationName":"Medical Physics","prism:issn":"00942405","prism:volume":"38","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"3864","prism:coverDate":"2011-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2011","prism:doi":"10.1118/1.3613552","dc:description":"Purpose: To provide a method of accurate, submillimeter image‐guidance for the targeting of small brain tumors in an array of 5 mice when irradiating with the Gamma Knife Perfexion treatment unit. Small‐animal models provide a useful platform for studying the effects of radioprotectors and radiosensitizers on normal brain tissue and tumors. Efficient irradiation of an array of up to 5 mice in a single programmed sequence, using the Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion (GKPfx) treatment unit, is an ongoing technique at our institution. One challenge in the process is to accurately guide the 4‐ mm‐diameter radiation beams' focus of the GKPfx treatment unit to irradiate only a small region of interest (ROI) that includes the hippocampus. This can be accomplished through image guidance using a high‐field, high‐resolution small‐animal MR imager and transforming the ROI image coordinates to Leksell stereotactic treatment coordinates. Materials and Methods: Uniquely‐tagged mice were individually‐scanned using a small‐animal MR imager. Prior to scanning, each mouse was carefully positioned and immobilized with ear bars and a bite bar using a specially designed mouse holder module, which has three, CT‐ and MR‐ viewable, fiducials embedded within it. The fiducials provide a 3‐D frame of reference to transform ROI image coordinates to Leksell stereotactic coordinates. A Matlab script displays the image set, provides a tool to locate fiducials and other ROIs in image coordinates, computes the coordinate system transforms and saves results in an Excel worksheet. Transform computation uses Horn's quaternion‐based method. Results: The previously described method shows accuracy of less than 1.0 mm, when imaging resolution is 0.3 mm in X and Y and 1.0mm in Z. Computation for one mouse holder position takes less than 2 s on 1.8GHz Centrino Duo PC.Conclusions: This image‐guided technique provides for fast and accurate MR/CT localized radiation targeting of mouse brain. © 2011, American Association of Physicists in Medicine.
