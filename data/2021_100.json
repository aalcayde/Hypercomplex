The self-test features of analog sensors have been used to examine if both the sensor and signal conditioning circuits are working properly. In case of sensor failure, a switching algorithm isolates the failed sensor and the system continues to operate with the redundant sensor. The switching algorithm has been implemented according to the quaternion based EKF.

Satellite images are rich in information about objects with different color intensity and have a large amount of noise, so it is difficult to achieve recognition, classification, and feature extraction of small objects through traditional edge detection algorithms. The colors in satellite images suffer from a large amount of overlap due to areas or weather conditions that generate a lot of noise. Edge detection provides detailed information about objects in an image by reducing unnecessary feature information. Edge detection in color images is more challenging than edge detection in gray-level images. This paper proposes a method for the edge detection of color images using Clifford algebra and its sub-algebra, quaternions. Quaternion-based Fourier transform is used to process red, green and blue (RGB) images separately in the vector field. A 3×3 quaternion mask is developed to filter out frequencies of the image in multiple directions and only provides details about the edges. The algorithm works on three channels individually; the output is then processed through quaternion Fourier transform (QFT) and inverse QFT with a 3×3 mask to filter high frequencies. The proposed algorithm is compared with traditional edge detection algorithms using a satellite image dataset that has different types of objects and detailed information. Results are validated through entropy, structure similarity, and noise error to prove that our proposed algorithm provides satisfactory performance on different remote sensed images.","citedby-count":"24","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60194941","afid":"60194941","affilname":"MNS-University of

Our problem formulation is based on dual quaternions, enabling two different online capable solving approaches. We provide a certifiable globally optimal and a fast local approach along with a method to verify the globality of the local approach. Additionally, means for integrating previous knowledge, for example, a common ground plane for planar sensor motion, are described. Our algorithms are evaluated on simulated data and on a publicly available dataset containing RGB-D camera images. Further, our online calibration approach is tested on the KITTI odometry dataset, which provides data of a lidar and two stereo camera systems mounted on a vehicle.

When dealing with quaternion signals, traditional real-valued learning models usually provide only suboptimal solutions compared with their quaternion-valued counterparts. However, online sequential quaternion extreme learning machine (OS-QELM) model is still lacking in literature. To fill this gap, this paper aims to establish a framework for the derivation and the design of OS-QELM. Specifically, we first derive a standard OS-QELM, and then propose two augmented OS-QELM models which can capture the complete second-order statistics of noncircular quaternion signals. The corresponding regularized models and two approaches to reducing the computational complexity are also derived and discussed respectively. Benefiting from the quaternion algebra and the augmented structure, the proposed models exhibit superiority over OS-ELM in simulation results on several benchmark quaternion regression problems and colour face recognition problems.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029322","afid":"60029322","affilname":"Dalian Maritime University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/122364978","afid":"122364978","affilname":"Hrg (Shandong) Intelligent Equipment Research Institute","affiliation-city":"Jinan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216947143","authid":"57216947143","authname":"Zhu S.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Shuai","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029322"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221912493","authid":"57221912493","authname":"Wang H.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Hui","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029322"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57210281842","authid":"57210281842","authname":"Lv H.","surname":"Lv","given-name":"Hui","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"122364978"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35933005200","authid":"35933005200","orcid":"0000-0001-7394-7295","authname":"Zhang H.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Huisheng","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029322"}]}],"authkeywords":"Augmented quaternion statistics | Extreme learning machine | Online sequential learning | Quaternion signal processing","source-id":"24806","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61301202","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85100535431"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85100535431?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85100535431&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85100535431&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85100535431","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85100535431","eid":"2-s2.0-85100535431","dc:title":"Multiple-image encryption based on cascaded gyrator transforms and high-dimensional chaotic system","dc:creator":"Sun X.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","prism:issn":"13807501","prism:eIssn":"15737721","prism:volume":"80","prism:issueIdentifier":"10","prism:pageRange":"15825-15848","prism:coverDate":"2021-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2021","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11042-021-10550-7","dc:description":"In order to increase encryption capacity and improve transmission efficiency, this paper investigates an encryption scheme for multiple-image based on cascaded gyrator transforms and high-dimensional chaos. Firstly, each plainimage is converted into a real matrix through modulation, quaternion gyrator transform and sharing. The real matrices are connected in turn by plural coding and gyrator transforms. During the process of cascade, phase truncation and preservation operations are performed. The phase of the preceding transformation is modulated by that of the latter complex matrix to enhance security. Followed by splicing and scrambling, a real-valued ciphertext can be obtained. At the receiver end, all the plaintext images can be restituted by the reverse operation of the encryption process using the authorized keys. The adoption of high-dimensioanl chaos and Kronecker product further guarantees the security of the cryptosystem. The numerical results performed on 300 color images have demonstrated that the average PSNR of correctly decrypted images is up to 303.9939 dB, the NMSE is as low as 2.8024 × 10−28 and SSIM is equal to 1.0000. The analysis of sensitivity, statistical characteristic and robustness proves the feasibility and relibility of the proposed encryption scheme.","citedby-count":"15","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020256","afid":"60020256","affilname":"Capital Normal University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007711","afid":"60007711","affilname":"Jilin University","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113687661","afid":"113687661","affilname":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Imaging Technology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/108065255","afid":"108065255","affilname":"Wuzhou Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine","affiliation-city":"Wuzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221908234","authid":"57221908234","authname":"Sun X.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Xiaoni","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55849891700","authid":"55849891700","orcid":"0000-0002-4847-282X","authname":"Shao Z.","surname":"Shao","given-name":"Zhuhong","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101867863","authid":"7101867863","authname":"Shang Y.","surname":"Shang","given-name":"Yuanyuan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020256"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113687661"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219776374","authid":"57219776374","authname":"Liang M.","surname":"Liang","given-name":"Mingxian","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"108065255"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221911265","authid":"57221911265","authname":"Yang F.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Fengjian","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]}],"authkeywords":"Cascaded gyrator transforms | Fractional order Chua’s system | Kronecker product | Multiple-image encryption | Sharing","source-id":"25627","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"SQKM201810028018","fund-sponsor":"Beijing Municipal Excellent Talents Foundation","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099985285"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099985285?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85099985285&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85099985285&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099985285","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85099985285","eid":"2-s2.0-85099985285","dc:title":"Fusing structure and color features for cancelable face recognition","dc:creator":"Xu Z.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","prism:issn":"13807501","prism:eIssn":"15737721","prism:volume":"80","prism:issueIdentifier":"9","prism:pageRange":"14477-14494","prism:coverDate":"2021-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2021","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11042-020-10234-8","dc:description":"Face-based biometric recognition is widely used nowadays, where substantial face images are commonly stored on third-party servers. Since the sensitive information of an individual is contained in facial image such as the age and health condition, it is necessary to protect its privacy and security. This paper investigates a cancelable color face template protection algorithm. To make full use of quaternion representation, the structural information including local variance and gradient is respectively served as the real part. To achieve revocability and ability to redistribute, the strategy of random permutation with binary matrix is adopted. Afterwards, the quaternion-based two-dimensional principal component analysis is employed to extract features. With them, the extreme learning machine can be trained and used for recognition. Experimental results performed on four different color face datasets have demonstrated that the fusion of structural information can greatly improve the accuracy. More importantly, the random permutation not only does not reduce the recognition accuracy, but also guarantees the security and revocation of face template.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073737","afid":"60073737","affilname":"Zhongyuan University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Zhengzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020256","afid":"60020256","affilname":"Capital Normal University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113687661","afid":"113687661","affilname":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Imaging Technology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221732766","authid":"57221732766","authname":"Xu Z.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Zihan","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55849891700","authid":"55849891700","orcid":"0000-0002-4847-282X","authname":"Shao Z.","surname":"Shao","given-name":"Zhuhong","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101867863","authid":"7101867863","authname":"Shang Y.","surname":"Shang","given-name":"Yuanyuan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020256"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113687661"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56203394400","authid":"56203394400","authname":"Li B.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Bicao","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073737"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56870698700","authid":"56870698700","authname":"Ding H.","surname":"Ding","given-name":"Hui","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55250686500","authid":"55250686500","authname":"Liu T.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Tie","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020256"}]}],"authkeywords":"Cancelable face recognition | Quaternion representation | Random permutation | Structural feature","source-id":"25627","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"2016000020124G088","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099468748"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099468748?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85099468748&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85099468748&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099468748","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85099468748","eid":"2-s2.0-85099468748","dc:title":"New watermarking algorithm utilizing quaternion Fourier transform with advanced scrambling and secure encryption","dc:creator":"Bhatti U.A.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","prism:issn":"13807501","prism:eIssn":"15737721","prism:volume":"80","prism:issueIdentifier":"9","prism:pageRange":"13367-13387","prism:coverDate":"2021-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2021","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11042-020-10257-1","dc:description":"Digital watermarking technology, as a powerful tool for copyright protection and content authentication of multimedia works, has received increasing attention, and the current image watermarking technology has developed significantly. Generally, embedding a watermark is done in grayscale images, mainly due to the fact that grayscale images are easier to process than color images, and grayscale images only contain brightness information and color-free information, in which an embedded watermark will not produce new color components. In real life, however, color images are more common than grayscale image information. To improve the security of the watermark information and the ability to embed the location and improve the security of the algorithm against a variety of attacks, this paper proposes an algorithm based on quaternion Fourier transform (QFT) with chaotic encryption and Arnold scrambling. Geometric Algebra (GA) can process color images in the form of vectors, and each component of Red,Green and Blue (RGB) should be processed separately. We utilized quaternion (which is a subalgebra of GA) and effectively completed color image processing by utilizing Fourier transform. After utilizing QFT, each component was made more secure by scrambling the pixels of the watermark and performing encryption utilizing chaotic sequencing. Different types of results utilizing Mean Square Error (MSE),Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR),Structure Similiarity Index Metric (SSIM), etc. were computed to verify the performance of our proposed algorithm and show that the robustness and security are high by utilizing our method.","citedby-count":"17","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020258","afid":"60020258","affilname":"Nanjing Normal University","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017716","afid":"60017716","affilname":"Hainan University","affiliation-city":"Haikou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000065","afid":"60000065","affilname":"School of Medicine, Southeast University","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194505499","authid":"57194505499","authname":"Bhatti U.A.","surname":"Bhatti","given-name":"Uzair Aslam","initials":"U.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020258"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23490892300","authid":"23490892300","authname":"Yuan L.","surname":"Yuan","given-name":"Linwang","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020258"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020258"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020258"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23491178000","authid":"23491178000","authname":"Yu Z.","surname":"Yu","given-name":"Zhaoyuan","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020258"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58435381800","authid":"58435381800","authname":"Li J.B.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Jing Bing","initials":"J.B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017716"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57207104583","authid":"57207104583","authname":"Nawaz S.A.","surname":"Nawaz","given-name":"Saqib Ali","initials":"S.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017716"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57200864193","authid":"57200864193","authname":"Mehmood A.","surname":"Mehmood","given-name":"Anum","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000065"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56335694300","authid":"56335694300","authname":"Zhang K.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Kun","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017716"}]}],"authkeywords":"Clifford algebra | Color watermarking | Secure watermarking","source-id":"25627","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"41625004","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85097333843"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85097333843?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85097333843&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85097333843&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0378475420304535"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85097333843","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85097333843","eid":"2-s2.0-85097333843","dc:title":"Quarternion color image processing as an alternative to classical grayscale conversion approaches for pest detection using yellow sticky traps","dc:creator":"Rodríguez L.A.R.","prism:publicationName":"Mathematics and Computers in Simulation","prism:issn":"03784754","prism:volume":"182","prism:pageRange":"646-660","prism:coverDate":"2021-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2021","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.matcom.2020.11.022","pii":"S0378475420304535","dc:description":"Efficient detection of pests in different types of crops continues to be on today's standards a difficult task. In order to address this problem, the implementation of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) system involving the detection and classification of insects (pests) is essential for intensive production systems. Traditionally, this has been done by placing hunting traps and later manually counting and identifying the insects found. This has proven to be a very time-consuming and expensive process. Here's where it enters image processing, a method that in the last few years has demonstrated to be a feasible solution to the problem. However, most of the related works with good results mostly rely on images taken from traps placed in greenhouses making the processing a bit easier given the low insect saturation of the traps, which is related to how controlled is the environment in such places. When working with the same task in fields the degree of difficulty increases exponentially given the influence of opposite conditions to the ones mentioned before. This work describes a new approach to the task, by using color image processing with quaternions. The methods proposed here provide a way to extract edge maps from images of yellow sticky traps without losing the spectral relation of the channels composing the image. As a result, all insects in the image are correctly delineated regardless of their color, size and intensity. This allows for more accurate pest detection because it is possible to discriminate and identify different types of insects. The application of this approach was compared with other methods proposed in several papers, showing promising results with much thicker and better closed edges.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114251807","afid":"114251807","affilname":"Col.

The coupling between central rigid body and flexible attachment has been effectively retained in the controller design. First, an open-loop modal observer is constructed in advantage of the inherent physical characteristics of flexible modes, and then an adaptive backstepping controller involving flexible modal estimation, spacecraft attitude quaternion, and angular velocity is designed. Next, the band-pass filters are employed to separate the low-frequency gimbal command angular rate signal and medium–high-frequency rotor command angular rate signal, respectively, so that MSCMG can accurately track the command signal output by the integrated controller. Taking advantage of MSCMG’s ability to output high bandwidth micro-gimbal moment, the proposed method can not only meet the requirement of spacecraft rapid maneuver but also effectively suppress the broadband micro-vibration, including low-frequency flexible vibration and medium–high-frequency micro-vibration caused by spacecraft rotating parts.

According to the quaternion theory in the kinematic model of the cameras and the analytical solution of uncertainty with the GUM method, the complete, detailed, and continuous uncertainty results of the full-scale measurement space can be obtained. Firstly, one-dimensional turntables and rigid connections are utilized to form the motion cores and the automatic control carriers in the system. Secondly, the novel measurement model is used in the measurement process to shorten the calibration and measurement chains. Once the system based on the novel measurement model is set up, the analytical solution of uncertainty is utilized in the accuracy process. During the analysis process, the strong correlation among the extrinsic parameters is decoupled by introducing virtual circles and the measurement strategy with the GUM method. Through analyzing the relationship among the attitude angles, the major factors which influence the uncertainties in each axis and the final uncertainty are clarified. Moreover, the analytical continuous uncertainty maps for the uncertainties along each axis, combined standard uncertainty, and the expanded uncertainty are illustrated and the uncertainty variation tendency is declared. Finally, the analytical solution of uncertainty with the GUM method proposed in this paper predicts the uncertainty in the full-scale space and provides a new idea of the uncertainty analysis for the complicated combined measurement system.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019533","afid":"60019533","affilname":"Tianjin University","affiliation-city":"Tianjin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"33820336","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203011895","authid":"57203011895","authname":"Chen X.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Xiaoyun","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019533"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55656074300","authid":"55656074300","authname":"Lin J.","surname":"Lin","given-name":"Jiarui","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019533"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56083936800","authid":"56083936800","authname":"Sun Y.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Yanbiao","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019533"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222365941","authid":"57222365941","authname":"Ma H.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Huiyu","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019533"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36467309700","authid":"36467309700","authname":"Zhu J.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Jigui","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019533"}]}],"source-id":"12862","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"51835007","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85095957675"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85095957675?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85095957675&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85095957675&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0950705120306973"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85095957675","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85095957675","eid":"2-s2.0-85095957675","dc:title":"Local quaternion polar harmonic Fourier moments-based multiple zero-watermarking scheme for color medical images","dc:creator":"Xia Z.","prism:publicationName":"Knowledge-Based Systems","prism:issn":"09507051","prism:volume":"216","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-03-15","prism:coverDisplayDate":"15 March 2021","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.knosys.2020.106568","pii":"S0950705120306973","dc:description":"Zero-watermarking schemes are currently dedicated to resisting general desynchronization attacks, such as rotation and scaling, but cannot effectively resist complex desynchronization attacks, such as translation, cropping, length–width ratio changing, UnZign, and zero-padding. To this end, a robust zero-watermarking scheme resistant to complex desynchronization attacks was proposed in this paper based on local feature regions (LFRs) and quaternion polar harmonic Fourier moments (QPHFMs). First, the stable feature points of original color medical images were extracted with a speeded-up robust feature (SURF) operator; then, the stable LFRs were obtained through a feature scale-adaptive process and scale-standardized tests. Finally, the QPHFMs of the LFRs were calculated, and multiple feature sequences were constructed using their magnitudes and binarized to generate multiple zero-watermarks. The experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme can not only resist common image processing attacks and general desynchronization attacks but also robustly resist complex desynchronization attacks, such as translation, cropping, length–width ratio changing, UnZign, and zero-padding. The proposed scheme is superior to the state-of-the-art LFR-based multiple embedded watermarking schemes and zero-watermarking schemes.","citedby-count":"30","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true",

An octonion-valued neural network with a feedforward network topology is considered and is applied to the design of a control system for handling dynamic control problems of a robot manipulator. In the control system, the output of the octonion-valued neural network is used as the control input for the robot manipulator to ensure that the end-effector of the robot manipulator tracks a desired trajectory in a three-dimensional space. To validate the effectiveness of using the octonion-valued neural network, computational experiments on controlling a three-link robot manipulator using the proposed control system were conducted, with the simulation results confirming the feasibility and characteristics of this network in practical control tasks.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010726","afid":"60010726","affilname":"Doshisha University","affiliation-city":"Kyoto","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7409417392","authid":"7409417392","authname":"Takahashi K.","surname":"Takahashi","given-name":"Kazuhiko","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010726"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222870117","authid":"57222870117","authname":"Fujita M.","surname":"Fujita","given-name":"Miyabi","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010726"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211218398","authid":"57211218398","authname":"Hashimoto M.","surname":"Hashimoto","given-name":"Masafumi","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010726"}]}],"authkeywords":"Control | Feedforward network | Neural network | Octonion | Robot manipulator","article-number":"9385617","source-id":"21101042189","fund-acr":"KAKEN","fund-no":"JP20K11980","fund-sponsor":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85100655324"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85100655324?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85100655324&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85100655324&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85100655324","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85100655324","eid":"2-s2.0-85100655324","dc:title":"On uncertainty principle for the two-sided quaternion linear canonical transform","dc:creator":"Zhu X.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Pseudo-Differential Operators and Applications","prism:issn":"16629981","prism:eIssn":"1662999X","prism:volume":"12","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"March 2021","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11868-021-00395-x","dc:description":"The quaternion linear canonical transform (QLCT), as a generalized form of the quaternion Fourier transform, is a powerful analyzing tool in image and signal processing.

Moreover, we proposed a modified fuzzy vector mean filtering to cope with motion outliers and made use of bilateral motion vector modification in the post-processing part. We have assessed our proposed method performance using six widely available benchmark test sequences and three echocardiography image sequences. The evaluations confirm that while our proposed method keeps the PSNR and SSIM performance suitable, it is at least twice faster in comparison with reference methods on the benchmark dataset. The echocardiography evaluations reveal our proposed method superiority in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and computation time, which make the proposed method suitable as an echocardiographic-specific method.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007751","afid":"60007751","affilname":"Amirkabir University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36463791300","authid":"36463791300","authname":"Khoubani S.","surname":"Khoubani","given-name":"Sahar","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004476897","authid":"7004476897","orcid":"0000-0002-3386-4003","authname":"Moradi M.H.","surname":"Moradi","given-name":"Mohammad Hassan","initials":"M.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]}],"authkeywords":"Echocardiography frame rate up-conversion | Frame interpolation | Frame rate up-conversion | Motion compensation | Quaternion wavelet","source-id":"25627","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85079722128"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85079722128?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85079722128&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85079722128&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85079722128","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85079722128","eid":"2-s2.0-85079722128","dc:title":"Fabric defect detection based on information entropy and frequency domain saliency","dc:creator":"Liu G.","prism:publicationName":"Visual Computer","prism:issn":"01782789","prism:volume":"37","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"515-528","prism:coverDate":"2021-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"March 2021","prism:doi":"10.1007/s00371-020-01820-w","dc:description":"The automatic detection of defects is an important part of the fabric production process. However, existing methods of detecting defects in fabrics with periodic patterns lack adaptability and perform poorly in detection. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised fabric defect detection method based on the human visual attention mechanism. The method introduces two-dimensional entropy which can reflect the spatial distribution characteristics of images based on one-dimensional entropy, according to the relationship between information entropy and image texture. The image is reconstructed into a quaternion matrix by combining two-dimensional entropy and three feature maps that characterize the opponent color space representation of the input image. The hypercomplex Fourier transform is then used to transform the quaternion image matrix into the frequency domain. We propose a new method for local tuning of amplitude spectrum, thereby suppressing the background pattern while retaining the defect region. Finally, the inverse transform is performed to obtain a saliency map. Through experimental comparisons and a series of numerical evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed method has a better detection effect compared to state-of-the-art methods in fabric defect detection.","citedby-count":"23","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60195520","afid":"60195520","affilname":"Tiangong University","affiliation-city":"Tianjin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204011120","authid":"57204011120","orcid":"0000-0003-0892-4518","authname":"Liu G.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Guohua","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60195520"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60195520"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57215019677","authid":"57215019677","authname":"Zheng X.","surname":"Zheng","given-name":"Xiangtong","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60195520"}]}],"authkeywords":"Fabric defect detection | Hypercomplex Fourier transform | Information entropy | Visual attention","source-id":"26146","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85102376105"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85102376105?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85102376105&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85102376105&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85102376105","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85102376105","eid":"2-s2.0-85102376105","dc:title":"Design of four-rotor autonomous target-dropping aircraft based on image processing","dc:creator":"Li R.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Physics: Conference Series","prism:issn":"17426588","prism:eIssn":"17426596","prism:volume":"1800","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-02-27","prism:coverDisplayDate":"27 February 2021","prism:doi":"10.1088/1742-6596/1800/1/012002","dc:description":"The aim of this study is to design and produce a quad-rotor autonomous target shooting aircraft based on STM32F407 microprocessor and OV7725 image acquisition system.

Then, four circuits of the flight control system were designed, including the main control circuit, attitude measurement circuit, throwing rake control circuit and image processing circuit. In addition, three algorithms related to aircraft were prepared, including attitude control cascade PID algorithm, height control algorithm and attitude solution algorithm, and an image processing software was designed. On this basis, the aircraft was built, and finally its flight attitude, height, fixed point, and hover were tested. The results showed that all the algorithms are correct, and the aircraft can successfully pitch, roll, yaw, recognize image trajectory, and automatically drop materials and

assessment, which makes the evaluation results inconsistent with the results of human observation.A no-reference blurred color image quality assessment algorithm is proposed based on QDCT and Bayes spectral entropy, because the more blurred a image is, the more unevenly distributed these high frequency components are.Firstly, a quaternion matrix is used to represent a color image before it is divided into non-overlapping sub-matrices of 8×8 pixels.Then, the spectrum of each sub-matrix can be obtained by QDCT.Finally, in order to evaluate the quality of a color image, Bayes spectral entropy is calculated to measure the uniformity of high frequency components in the spectrum.The PLCC and SRCC values of the proposed algorithm on database IVC, TID2013 and CSIQ all reach above 0.920

In particular, a pure quaternion matrix can be used to represent red, green, and blue channels of color images. A low-rank approximation for a pure quaternion matrix can be obtained by using the quaternion singular value decomposition. However, this approximation is not optimal in the sense that the resulting low-rank approximation matrix may not be pure quaternion, i.e., the low-rank matrix contains a real component which is not useful for the representation of a color image. The main contribution of this paper is to find an optimal rank-r pure quaternion matrix approximation for a pure quaternion matrix (a color image). Our idea is to use a projection on a low-rank quaternion matrix manifold and a projection on a quaternion matrix with zero real component, and develop an alternating projections algorithm to find such optimal low-rank pure quaternion matrix approximation. The convergence of the projection algorithm can be established by showing that the low-rank quaternion matrix manifold and the zero real component quaternion matrix manifold has a nontrivial intersection point. Numerical examples on synthetic pure quaternion matrices and color images are presented to illustrate the projection algorithm can find optimal low-rank pure quaternion approximation for pure quaternion matrices or color images.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009860","afid":"60009860","affilname":"Fudan University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006541","afid":"60006541","affilname":"The University of Hong Kong","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003736","afid":"60003736","affilname":"Weifang University","affiliation-city":"Weifang","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16317511000","authid":"16317511000","authname":"Song G.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Guangjing","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003736"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55859554200","authid":"55859554200","authname":"Ding W.","surname":"Ding","given-name":"Weiyang","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009860"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34571761900","authid":"34571761900","authname":"Ng M.K.","surname":"Ng","given-name":"Michael K.","initials":"M.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006541"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color images | Low-rank approximation | Manifolds | Pure quaternion matrices","source-id":"26419","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"ZR2020KA008","fund-sponsor":"Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85100751033"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85100751033?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85100751033&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85100751033&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85100751033","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85100751033","eid":"2-s2.0-85100751033","dc:title":"Quaternion Projection Rule for Rotor Hopfield Neural Networks","dc:creator":"Kobayashi M.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","prism:issn":"2162237X","prism:eIssn":"21622388","prism:volume":"32","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"900-908","prism:coverDate":"2021-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"February 2021","prism:doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2020.2979920","dc:description":"A rotor Hopfield neural network (RHNN) is an extension of a complex-valued Hopfield neural network (CHNN) and has excellent noise tolerance.
