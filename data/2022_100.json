We propose a robust zero watermarking scheme for DT-MRI tensor image based on orthogonal ray-casting tensor sampling (ORCTS) and the quaternion generic polar complex exponential transform (QGPCET), which can effectively provide integrity verification and copyright protection measures for DT-MRI, also can greatly improve the efficiency of watermarking. First we propose the ORCTS for DT-MRI tensor data, which allows feature engineering of the physiological tissue information represented by DT-MRI, using ORCTS to generate three feature images of DT-MRI in coronal, sagittal and axial planes. Then uses three feature images as the quaternion's three imaginary components, calculates their QGPCET coefficients to constructing the coefficients feature image; Finally the zero watermarking image is obtained by performing the XOR operation between the coefficients feature image and watermarking information. Compared to other zero watermarking schemes for 2D medical images, the results of experiments show that proposed scheme can resist common image processing attacks and geometric attacks with better robustness, and can guarantee the medical availability of DT-MRI tensor data. In the best case, the scheme can reduce the watermarking storage consumption to 0.07%. and reduce the time consumption to 0.75%.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005027","afid":"60005027","affilname":"Guizhou University","affiliation-city":"Guiyang","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221162898","authid":"57221162898","orcid":"0000-0002-4653-2569","authname":"Gao J.","surname":"Gao","given-name":"Jian","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005027"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56980660400","authid":"56980660400","authname":"Li Z.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Zhi","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005027"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58461107200","authid":"58461107200","orcid":"0000-0001-8153-4247","authname":"Fan B.","surname":"Fan","given-name":"Bin","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005027"}]}],"authkeywords":"Diffusion tensor-Magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) | Ray-casting tensor sampling | Robustness | Scheme efficiency | Zero watermarking","article-number":"103106","source-id":"21100332403","fund-acr":"NIH","fund-no":"ZK[2021","fund-sponsor":"National Institutes of Health","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85122665543"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85122665543?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85122665543&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85122665543&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0030402622000213"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85122665543","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85122665543","eid":"2-s2.0-85122665543","dc:title":"Infrared and visible image fusion based on QNSCT and Guided Filter","dc:creator":"Yang C.","prism:publicationName":"Optik","prism:issn":"00304026","prism:volume":"253","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"March 2022","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.ijleo.2022.168592","pii":"S0030402622000213","dc:description":"Image fusion is the process of fusing multiple images of the same scene to obtain a more informative image for human eye perception. In this paper, a new fusion framework based on Quaternion Non-Subsampled Contourlet Transform (QNSCT) and Guided Filter detail enhancement is designed to address the problems of inconspicuous infrared targets and poor background texture in Infrared and visible image fusion. The proposed method uses the quaternion wavelet transform for the first time instead of the traditional Non-Subsampled Pyramid Filter Bank structure in the Non-Subsampled Contourlet Transform (NSCT). The flexible multi-resolution of quaternion wavelet and the multi-directionality of NSCT are fully utilized to refine the multi-scale decomposition scheme. On the other hand, the coefficient matrix obtained from the proposed QNSCT algorithm is fused using a weight refinement algorithm based on the guided filter. The fusion scheme is divided into four steps. First, the Infrared and visible images are decomposed into multi-directional and multiscale coefficient matrices using QNSCT. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm not only extracts important visual information from the source image, but also preserves the texture information in the scene better. Meanwhile, the scheme outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective evaluations.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023277","afid":"60023277","affilname":"Xi'an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010955","afid":"60010955","affilname":"Changchun University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57408887500","authid":"57408887500","authname":"Yang C.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Chenxuan","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010955"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57408544500","authid":"57408544500","authname":"He Y.","surname":"He","given-name":"Yunan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010955"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57408715400","authid":"57408715400","authname":"Sun C.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Ce","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023277"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57700119100","authid":"57700119100","authname":"Jiang S.","surname":"Jiang","given-name":"Sheng","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010955"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7502077071","authid":"7502077071","authname":"Li Y.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Ye","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010955"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57199759311","authid":"57199759311","authname":"Zhao P.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Peng","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010955"}]}],"authkeywords":"Guided Filter | Image fusion | Infrared and visible images | Multiscale | QNSCT","article-number":"168592","source-id":"110152","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85122612563"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85122612563?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85122612563&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85122612563&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85122612563","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85122612563","eid":"2-s2.0-85122612563","dc:title":"In-motion initial alignment method for a laser Doppler velocimeter-aided strapdown inertial navigation system based on an adaptive unscented quaternion H-infinite filter","dc:creator":"Xiang Z.","prism:publicationName":"Measurement Science and Technology","prism:issn":"09570233","prism:eIssn":"13616501","prism:volume":"33","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"March 2022","prism:doi":"10.1088/1361-6501/ac37e9","dc:description":"With its advantages of high velocity measurement accuracy and fast dynamic response, the laser Doppler velocimeter (LDVs) is expected to replace the odometer (OD) in combination with a strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) to give a higher-precision integrated navigation system. Since a LDV has higher velocity measurement accuracy and data update frequency than an OD and Doppler velocity log, a LDV is used for the first time in this paper to aid a SINS in in-motion alignment. Considering that some approximation is used in the alignment model, the uncertainty noise of the sensors during the motion process and the unknown noise parameters during the filter process, an adaptive unscented quaternion H-infinite estimator (AUSQUHE) is proposed. The proposed AUSQUHE method has high robustness since it combines the advantages of an unscented quaternion estimator and H-infinite filter. The adaptive threshold of the H-infinite filter and the adaptive measurement noise covariance matrix are introduced to make the filter adapt to the changing environment and accelerate the convergence of errors. The performance of the proposed method is verified by a vehicle field test with a normal LDV signal and a vehicle test with the LDV signal disturbed by noise. The results show that the proposed method has higher alignment accuracy, faster convergence speed and stronger robustness than the four other compared methods.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024350","afid":"60024350","affilname":"National University of Defense Technology China","affiliation-city":"Changsha","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57247475100","authid":"57247475100","authname":"Xiang Z.","surname":"Xiang","given-name":"Zhiyi","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191537280","authid":"57191537280","authname":"Wang Q.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Qi","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203147753","authid":"57203147753","authname":"Huang R.","surname":"Huang","given-name":"Rong","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222357062","authid":"57222357062","authname":"Xi C.","surname":"Xi","given-name":"Chongbin","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36437546800","authid":"36437546800","authname":"Nie X.","surname":"Nie","given-name":"Xiaoming","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56373580800","authid":"56373580800","orcid":"0000-0001-6443-2644","authname":"Zhou J.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Jian","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024350"}]}],"authkeywords":"adaptive unscented quaternion H-infinite estimator (AUSQUHE) | in-motion alignment | laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV) | strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS)","article-number":"035001","source-id":"15526","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85119439767"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85119439767?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85119439767&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85119439767&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85119439767","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85119439767","eid":"2-s2.0-85119439767","dc:title":"A Novel Widely Linear Quaternion Multiband-Structured Subband Adaptive Filter Algorithm","dc:creator":"Huang W.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","prism:issn":"15497747","prism:eIssn":"15583791","prism:volume":"69","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"1962-1966","prism:coverDate":"2022-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 March 2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2021.3125801","dc:description":"A novel widely-linear quaternion multiband-structured subband adaptive filter (WL-QMSAF) algorithm is proposed for further enhancing the convergence rate of estimation error when input signals are greatly correlated in the quaternion domain.

The developed method addresses and solves PnL via exploiting the problem's geometry in a non-linear least squares fashion. Specifically, by representing the rotation matrix with a novel quaternion parameterization, the PnL problem is first decomposed into four independent subproblems. Then, each subproblem is reformulated as an unconstrained minimization problem, in which the Kronecker product is adopted to write the cost function in a more compact form. Finally, the Gröbner basis technique is used to solve the polynomial system derived from the first-order optimality conditions of the cost function. Moreover, a novel strategy is presented to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. It is improved by exploiting structure information embedded in the rotation parameterization to accelerate the computing of coefficient matrix of a cost function. Experiments on synthetic data and real images show that the developed method is comparable to or better than state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, but with reduced computational requirements.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021666","afid":"60021666","affilname":"Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56198039300","authid":"56198039300","authname":"YU Q.","surname":"YU","given-name":"Qida","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8849936900","authid":"8849936900","authname":"XU G.","surname":"XU","given-name":"Guili","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12779281000","authid":"12779281000","authname":"WANG Z.","surname":"WANG","given-name":"Zhengsheng","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35187422900","authid":"35187422900","authname":"LI Z.","surname":"LI","given-name":"Zhenhua","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021666"}]}],"authkeywords":"Camera pose estimation | Gröbner basis | Machine vision | Perspective-n-Line (PnL) problem | Quaternion parameterization","source-id":"13831","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61905112","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherhybridgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Hybrid Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85117888135"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85117888135?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85117888135&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85117888135&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0378475421003645"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85117888135","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85117888135","eid":"2-s2.0-85117888135","dc:title":"Global exponential synchronization of high-order quaternion Hopfield neural networks with unbounded distributed delays and time-varying discrete delays","dc:creator":"Chen Y.","prism:publicationName":"Mathematics and Computers in Simulation","prism:issn":"03784754","prism:volume":"193","prism:pageRange":"173-189","prism:coverDate":"2022-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"March 2022","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.matcom.2021.10.012","pii":"S0378475421003645","dc:description":"In this paper, the synchronization control problem of high-order quaternion Hopfield neural networks (HOQHNNs) with unbounded distributed delays and time-varying discrete delays is studied.

To meet the requirements of monitoring networks in terms of measurement accuracy, spatial resolution, and real-time or quasireal-time performance, a quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) image denoising algorithm is proposed to address the original edge node data for the structural monitoring networks of large infrastructures. A distributed Brillouin optical time-domain analysis (BOTDA) sensing system with a 40-km sensing fiber is established. The raw Brillouin gain spectrum (BGS) image is decomposed into one magnitude image and three phase images by QWT. The phase images of the OWT are distributed randomly and disorderly with respect to the noise, while the magnitude image of the quaternion wavelet is greatly affected by the noise. The useful message energy of the magnitude image is concentrated on a small number of coefficients with large amplitude, while the noise mainly corresponds to the coefficients with smaller amplitude. Then, the Bayes shrink threshold method is introduced to filter out noise in the magnitude image. The results indicate that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the frequency uncertainty have been improved significantly. The accuracy of the retrieved Brillouin frequency shift from denoised BGS images reaches 0.2 MHz, which corresponds to a temperature error of ±0.1 °C. Less than 4 s are required to process a BGS image with 50 \\times 40 000 pixels by the QWT denoising technique. The uploaded data obtained from 40 M bytes of raw data are reduced to 0.08 M bytes for each measurement. We hope that with technological progress and algorithm optimization, the distributed optical fiber sensing system based on the QWT image denoising algorithm will have an important role in the real-time application of large-scale infrastructure structural health monitoring for the Internet of Things.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025278","afid":"60025278","affilname":"Tsinghua University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016930","afid":"60016930","affilname":"Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55733886200","authid":"55733886200","orcid":"0000-0002-9112-816X","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yongjun","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016930"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24330114000","authid":"24330114000","orcid":"0000-0003-1391-7363","authname":"Yao H.","surname":"Yao","given-name":"Haipeng","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016930"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56039489400","authid":"56039489400","authname":"Wang J.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Jingjing","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025278"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102700839","authid":"7102700839","orcid":"0000-0002-1690-056X","authname":"Xin X.","surname":"Xin","given-name":"Xiangjun","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016930"}]}],"authkeywords":"Brillouin optical time-domain analysis | distributed optical fiber sensing network | quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) | structural monitoring for large infrastructure","source-id":"21100338350","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85104653150"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85104653150?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85104653150&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85104653150&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85104653150","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85104653150","eid":"2-s2.0-85104653150","dc:title":"Reduced Biquaternion Convolutional Neural Network for Color Image Processing","dc:creator":"Gai S.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","prism:issn":"10518215","prism:eIssn":"15582205","prism:volume":"32","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"1061-1075","prism:coverDate":"2022-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 March 2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2021.3073363","dc:description":"Reduced biquaternion is a four dimensional hyper-complex number which is commutative algebra and an extension of complex.

However, the algebra properties of the reduced biquaternion have not yet been well explored in the deep convolutional neural network. In this paper, we develop a new deep network structure, namely reduced biquaternion valued convolutional neural network (RQV-CNN).

Extensive experiments on color image classification and color image denoising are conducted to evaluate the promising performance of the RQV-CNN framework.

The proposed algorithm is applied to color image identification and approximation, and the experimental results demonstrate its efficiency and advantages to the existing algorithms.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073460","afid":"60073460","affilname":"China University of Mining and Technology","affiliation-city":"Xuzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004691","afid":"60004691","affilname":"Jiangsu Normal University","affiliation-city":"Xuzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8264355300","authid":"8264355300","orcid":"0000-0001-9408-0942","authname":"Jia Z.","surname":"Jia","given-name":"Zhigang","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004691"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219755992","authid":"57219755992","authname":"Liu X.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Xuan","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004691"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16205704600","authid":"16205704600","authname":"Zhao M.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Meixiang","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004691"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073460"}]}],"authkeywords":"Accelerate polynomials | Block-Lanczos method | Color image recognition | Multi-symplectic","article-number":"114664","source-id":"23847","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"2022J01378","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85123981192"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85123981192?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85123981192&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85123981192&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85123981192","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85123981192","eid":"2-s2.0-85123981192","dc:title":"Kinematical modeling of circular and elliptical polarization of the polarized light via screw transformation","dc:creator":"Ozdemir Z.","prism:publicationName":"Physica Scripta","prism:issn":"00318949","prism:eIssn":"14024896","prism:volume":"97","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"February 2022","prism:doi":"10.1088/1402-4896/ac485f","dc:description":"In this paper, it is shown that the motion of a polarized light wave in an optical fiber has a special meaning that relates the scalar and vector part of the dual quaternion to the kinematics concept of a screw.

Simultaneously, the color digital images are often attacked by a variety of attacks. For protecting the copyright of the color image, this paper proposes a blind color image watermarking algorithm based on Quaternion Singular Value Decomposition (QSVD). Firstly, the characteristic of quaternion that can make the color image channels associated with each other is applied to this paper for guaranteeing the anti-attack performance. Based on the above strategy, the non-overlapping image blocks are converted into quaternion image blocks. Then, the quaternion image blocks are decomposed by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and the diagonal matrix is obtained. Finally, the maximum eigenvalue of the diagonal matrix is quantized to complete the embedding and blind extraction of the color digital watermark. The simulation results show that the algorithm has good imperceptible and strong robustness for conventional and geometric attacks. Compared with other methods considered in this paper, the invisibility and robustness of the proposed method are improved.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073726","afid":"60073726","affilname":"Ludong University","affiliation-city":"Yantai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58391995500","authid":"58391995500","authname":"Sun Y.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Yehan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073726"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26633246300","authid":"26633246300","authname":"Su Q.","surname":"Su","given-name":"Qingtang","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073726"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57218516121","authid":"57218516121","authname":"Wang H.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Huanying","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073726"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56518475900","authid":"56518475900","authname":"Wang G.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Gang","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073726"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image | Invisibility | QSVD | Robustness | Watermarking","source-id":"25627","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"2019GGX101025","fund-sponsor":"Key Technology Research and Development Program of Shandong","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85121577848"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85121577848?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85121577848&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85121577848&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85121577848","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85121577848","eid":"2-s2.0-85121577848","dc:title":"Quaternion-based improved cuckoo algorithm for colour UAV image edge detection","dc:creator":"Liu D.","prism:publicationName":"IET Image Processing","prism:issn":"17519659","prism:volume":"16","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"926-935","prism:coverDate":"2022-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"February 2022","prism:doi":"10.1049/ipr2.12398","dc:description":"With the extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), there is an increasing demand for fast processing of coloured UAV images.

Accordingly, the colour image edge points can be determined based on the quaternion polar coordinating the rotation principle. Here, a quaternion-based improved cuckoo algorithm is proposed to perform fast processing for UAVs images. In particular, a novel guiding equation is used to optimize the positions of the improved cuckoo algorithm before the Levi flight. Furthermore, a novel disturbance equation is used to obtain a varied location for the next location after the Levi flight. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution. The experimental results showed that the proposed method significantly reduces the image processing time and remarkably improves the quality.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60092861","afid":"60092861","affilname":"Sichuan University of Arts and Science","affiliation-city":"Dazhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54385506700","authid":"54385506700","orcid":"0000-0001-8822-6722","authname":"Liu D.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Dujin","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60092861"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24832447400","authid":"24832447400","authname":"Pu G.","surname":"Pu","given-name":"Guolin","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60092861"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205604110","authid":"57205604110","authname":"Wu X.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Xiaoyan","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60092861"}]}],"source-id":"5400152646","fund-no":"2019BS005Z","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85121008532"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85121008532?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85121008532&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85121008532&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1361841521003479"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85121008532","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85121008532","eid":"2-s2.0-85121008532","dc:title":"SERV-CT: A disparity dataset from cone-beam CT for validation of endoscopic 3D reconstruction","dc:creator":"Edwards P.J.E.","prism:publicationName":"Medical Image Analysis","prism:issn":"13618415","prism:eIssn":"13618423","prism:volume":"76","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"February 2022","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.media.2021.102302","pii":"S1361841521003479","dc:description":"In computer vision, reference datasets from simulation and real outdoor scenes have been highly successful in promoting algorithmic development in stereo reconstruction. Endoscopic stereo reconstruction for surgical scenes gives rise to specific problems, including the lack of clear corner features, highly specular surface properties and the presence of blood and smoke. These issues present difficulties for both stereo reconstruction itself and also for standardised dataset production. Previous datasets have been produced using computed tomography (CT) or structured light reconstruction on phantom or ex vivo models. We present a stereo-endoscopic reconstruction validation dataset based on cone-beam CT (SERV-CT). Two ex vivo small porcine full torso cadavers were placed within the view of the endoscope with both the endoscope and target anatomy visible in the CT scan. Subsequent orientation of the endoscope was manually aligned to match the stereoscopic view and benchmark disparities, depths and occlusions are calculated. The requirement of a CT scan limited the number of stereo pairs to 8 from each ex vivo sample. For the second sample an RGB surface was acquired to aid alignment of smooth, featureless surfaces. Repeated manual alignments showed an RMS disparity accuracy of around 2 pixels and a depth accuracy of about 2 mm. A simplified reference dataset is provided consisting of endoscope image pairs with corresponding calibration, disparities, depths and occlusions covering the majority of the endoscopic image and a range of tissue types, including smooth specular surfaces, as well as significant variation of depth. We assessed the performance of various stereo algorithms from online available repositories. There is a significant variation between algorithms, highlighting some of the challenges of surgical endoscopic images. The SERV-CT dataset provides an easy to use stereoscopic validation for surgical applications with smooth reference disparities and depths covering the majority of the endoscopic image. This complements existing resources well and we hope will aid the development of surgical endoscopic anatomical reconstruction algorithms.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60204337","afid":"60204337","affilname":"Nationales Centrum für Tumorerkrankungen Dresden","affiliation-city":"Dresden","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022148","afid":"60022148","affilname":"University College London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017059","afid":"60017059","affilname":"German Cancer Research Center","affiliation-city":"Heidelberg","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"pubmed-id":"34906918","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401881894","authid":"7401881894","orcid":"0000-0003-0203-5736","authname":"Edwards P.J.E.","surname":"Edwards","given-name":"P.

Experimental results verify the correctness of the proposed method and show that 2-D QLCS has ideal performance in terms of scale invariance, numerical stabilities and image representation.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016835","afid":"60016835","affilname":"Beijing Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/127354271","afid":"127354271","affilname":"Beijing College of Finance and Commerce","affiliation-city":"Commerce","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57217687812","authid":"57217687812","authname":"Li Z.W.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Zhen Wei","initials":"Z.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36071614100","authid":"36071614100","orcid":"0000-0002-3850-4656","authname":"Li B.Z.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Bing Zhao","initials":"B.Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56511120600","authid":"56511120600","authname":"Qi M.","surname":"Qi","given-name":"Min","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"127354271"}]}],"authkeywords":"2-D quaternion linear canonical series | Image reconstruction | Linear canonical transform | Moment invariant | Orthogonal transforms","article-number":"116574","source-id":"13803","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"62171041","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85119278213"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85119278213?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85119278213&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85119278213&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0094576521005956"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85119278213","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85119278213","eid":"2-s2.0-85119278213","dc:title":"Attitude estimation and control based on modified unscented Kalman filter for gyro-less satellite with faulty sensors","dc:creator":"Pourtakdoust S.H.","prism:publicationName":"Acta Astronautica","prism:issn":"00945765","prism:volume":"191","prism:pageRange":"134-147","prism:coverDate":"2022-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"February 2022","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.actaastro.2021.11.008","pii":"S0094576521005956","dc:description":"A modified unscented Kalman filter is presented to estimate the quaternion parameters as well as the angular velocities of a rigid gyro-less satellite under faulty sensor conditions. The task is carried out using the Sun sensor and magnetometers as attitude sensors with bounded noise and unknown fault(s). Following the presentation of the satellite attitude dynamics and filtering formulations, a new fault detection and isolation algorithm is proposed. The latter is based on a modified unscented Kalman filter structure for improved fault detection, sensor isolation, and attitude control (AC). A Backtracking Search Algorithm (BSA) is also used to design and optimize the PID controller gains, as well as to optimize sensor installation orientation for residual signal decoupling. In this regard, the paper presents and proves a theory that describes how the proposed optimization process for sensor installation can analytically decouple the faulty orientation signal from the healthy ones. A comparison of attitude and angular velocity estimation approaches using the standard Kalman, extended Kalman, and a proposed modified unscented Kalman filter is also provided. The results show that the proposed filter performs significantly better in closed-loop AC systems and copes adequately with sensor faults.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027666","afid":"60027666","affilname":"Sharif University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55953294600","authid":"55953294600","orcid":"0000-0001-5717-6240","authname":"Pourtakdoust S.H.","surname":"Pourtakdoust","given-name":"Seid H.","initials":"S.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/37661919600","authid":"37661919600","authname":"Mehrjardi M.F.","surname":"Mehrjardi","given-name":"M.

Method: We design the wrist kinematics regression model following a novel ellipsoidal joint formulation, which features a quaternion-based rotation constraint and 2-dimensional Fourier linear combiners (FLC) to approximate the coupled rotations and translational displacements of the wrist. Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is then implemented to update the model in real-time. However, unlike previous studies, here we introduce a sparsity-promoting feature in the model regression through the optimality of EKF by designing a smooth ell 1-minimization observation function. This is done to ensure the best identification of key parameters, and to improve the robustness of regression under noisy conditions. Results: Simulations employ multiple reference models to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Experiments are later carried out on motion data collected by a lab-developed wrist kinematics measurement tool. Both simulation and experiment show that the proposed approach can robustly identify the wrist kinematics in real-time. Conclusion: The findings confirm that the proposed regression model combined with the sparsity-promoting EKF is reliable in the real-time modeling of wrist kinematics. Significance: The proposed method can be applied to generic wrist kinematics modeling problems, and utilized in the control system of wearable wrist exoskeletons. The framework of the proposed method may also be applied to real-time identification of other joints for exoskeleton control.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090","afid":"60027090","affilname":"Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University","affiliation-city":"Blacksburg","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"pubmed-id":"34506276","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204831771","authid":"57204831771","orcid":"0000-0003-4133-9388","authname":"Wang J.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Jiamin","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027090"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56853497100","authid":"56853497100","orcid":"0000-0002-9231-8328","authname":"Barry O.R.","surname":"Barry","given-name":"Oumar R.","initials":"O.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027090"}]}],"authkeywords":"ellipsoidal joint | extended kalman filter | fourier linear combiner | quaternion-based constraints | real-time model regression | Wrist kinematics | ℓ 1 -minimization","source-id":"16318","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85104848376"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85104848376?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85104848376&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85104848376&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85104848376","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85104848376","eid":"2-s2.0-85104848376","dc:title":"Deep learning based six-dimensional pose estimation in virtual reality","dc:creator":"Yang J.","prism:publicationName":"Computational Intelligence","prism:issn":"08247935","prism:eIssn":"14678640","prism:volume":"38","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"187-204","prism:coverDate":"2022-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"February 2022","prism:doi":"10.1111/coin.12453","dc:description":"Virtual reality technology, with its continuous development, is gradually applied to healthcare, education, business, and other fields.

A polynomial fisheye camera model has been used to generate each image considering flying camera along a pre-planned trajectory. A dataset with 2400 images is created and labeled using Blender. The images are processed before it is fed into the neural network using 20 masks to reduces errors caused by non-common parts of the edge in image. afterwards, the spherical moments are obtained, as well as the triplets and the basis. Finally the basis is converted into a quaternion as input of network. Because for a neural network, a smaller number of inputs means faster training and higher accuracy. For the training phase, a strategy of data augmentation is applied. The data set is divided into many fragments (folders) according to a folder size that can be adjusted. Among them, in each training set, a sliding window is used to expend combinations within a certain range to calculate the rotation between two images. In tne end, the model is tested with synthesized fisheye camera data from Blender. The used simulated environment contains different light and weather conditions like fog or bad lighting situation. The proposed method in this paper is compared with different feature-based methods like FAST, ORB, SURF etc., which cannot successfully extract the feature points, to prove the performance of this novel approach.

In this paper, hypercomplex numbers are introduced for GNSS signal representation and for algorithm development. The term \"hypercomplex\" is generally used to denote sets generalizing complex numbers and having more than one imaginary unit. They have the potential to represent multi-component signals, such as GNSS meta-signals, leading to a compact notation allowing effective derivations and algorithm development. The set of bicomplex numbers is considered and it is shown that they can be used to effectively represent a meta-signal made of components from two different frequencies. Using bicomplex numbers, it is possible to express a meta-signal as the product of a code, a carrier and a subcarrier component: this representation and the properties of bicomplex numbers lead to acquisition and tracking algorithms able to effectively process GNSS meta-signals solving the code ambiguity problem. Theoretical developments are demonstrated using real data collected using a software defined radio (SDR) front-end for the Galileo alternative binary offset carrier (AltBOC) signal.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/130107216","afid":"130107216","affilname":"Joint Research Centre","affiliation-city":null,"affiliation-country":null}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12779898300","authid":"12779898300","authname":"Borio D.","surname":"Borio","given-name":"Daniele","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"130107216"}]}],"source-id":"21101171593","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149441196"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149441196?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149441196&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149441196&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149441196","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85149441196","eid":"2-s2.0-85149441196","dc:title":"A Pattern Recognition Framework for Signal Processing in Metaverse","dc:creator":"Daneshfar F.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - 2022 8th International Iranian Conference on Signal Processing and Intelligent Systems, ICSPIS 2022","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781665476232"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICSPIS56952.2022.10044059","dc:description":"Recognizing emotions in Metaverse and the real world at the same time is a significant issue that is less addressed today and is very attractive to many psychologists. In this paper, using a simple machine learning (ML) network called echo state network (ESN), speech emotion recognition (SER) has been done in both the Metaverse and the real world. Due to the recursive structure of the reservoir used in ESNs, they will have limitations for modeling high-dimensional data (because of high memory consumption). In this paper, a new structure is presented to empower ESNs for high-dimensional signal processing. To reduce the complexity caused by hyper-complex data, an octonion-based nonlinear ESN (ONESN) has been proposed. In addition, two different scenarios are designed and analyzed for how to demonstrate the functionality of the proposed networks.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003263","afid":"60003263","affilname":"University of West Bohemia","affiliation-city":"Plzen","affiliation-country":"Czech Republic"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001619","afid":"60001619","affilname":"University of Kurdistan","affiliation-city":"Sanandaj","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35078447100","authid":"35078447100","authname":"Daneshfar F.","surname":"Daneshfar","given-name":"Fatemeh","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001619"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57317975000","authid":"57317975000","authname":"Jamshidi M.B.","surname":"Jamshidi","given-name":"Mohammad Behdad","initials":"M.B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003263"}]}],"authkeywords":"echo state network | machine learning | Metaverse | octonion algebra | speech emotion recognition","source-id":"21101138706","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149395820"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149395820?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149395820&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149395820&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149395820","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85149395820","eid":"2-s2.0-85149395820","dc:title":"APPLICATION OF A TENSOR INTERPOLATION METHOD ON THE DETERMINATION OF FIBER ORIENTATION TENSORS FROM COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY IMAGES","dc:creator":"Blarr J.","prism:publicationName":"ECCM 2022 - Proceedings of the 20th European Conference on Composite Materials: Composites Meet Sustainability","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9782970161400"}],"prism:volume":"4","prism:pageRange":"488-495","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","dc:description":"When investigating the mechanical behavior of fiber-reinforced polymers, fiber orientation plays a decisive role concerning anisotropy. Fiber orientation distributions are typically measured in the form of fiber orientation tensors. In order to measure orientation tensors, computed tomography scans and consecutive image processing methods have become one of the leading non-destructive testing methods. The conflict between scan resolution and sample size limits the volume that can be scanned. To obtain the fiber orientation behavior across an entire plate, a direct interpolation of orientation tensors computed from CT scans of smaller volumes at selected coordinates of the plate is implemented. Rather than a component-based interpolation, the authors chose a decomposition and reassembly method interpolating shape and orientation of the tensors separately. While this approach has been implemented and used for e.g. diffusion tensors in medical imaging, the authors consider the application to sparse but measured CT-based data to be a novelty.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60102538","afid":"60102538","affilname":"Karlsruher Institut für Technologie","affiliation-city":"Karlsruhe","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073306","afid":"60073306","affilname":"Fraunhofer Institute for Chemical Technology ICT","affiliation-city":"Pfinztal","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016060","afid":"60016060","affilname":"Universität Augsburg","affiliation-city":"Augsburg","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58127452800","authid":"58127452800","authname":"Blarr J.","surname":"Blarr","given-name":"Juliane","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58127640900","authid":"58127640900","authname":"Kresin N.","surname":"Kresin","given-name":"Noah","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216944781","authid":"57216944781","authname":"Krauß C.","surname":"Krauß","given-name":"Constantin","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12142516200","authid":"12142516200","authname":"Weidenmann K.A.","surname":"Weidenmann","given-name":"Kay A.","initials":"K.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016060"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073306"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55771677700","authid":"55771677700","authname":"Liebig W.V.","surname":"Liebig","given-name":"Wilfried V.","initials":"W.V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102538"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073306"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7103015211","authid":"7103015211","authname":"Elsner P.","surname":"Elsner","given-name":"Peter","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102538"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073306"}]}],"authkeywords":"image processing | non-destructive testing | quaternions | tensor algebra | tensor mapping","source-id":"21101138373","fund-acr":"DFG","fund-no":"IRTG 2078","fund-sponsor":"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
