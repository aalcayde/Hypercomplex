In this paper, the screw algorithm consisting of angular rate and specific force is optimized under a special screw motion. The special screw motion is derived from classical screw motion and can be taken as a complicated sculling motion including classical coning motion. Subsequently, the coefficients in the multi-sample screw algorithms and the corresponding algorithm drifts are determined by minimizing the error on direct component. The simulation results of attitude and velocity errors agree with the optimization goals, except when the number of subinterval is greater than 2.

The generalization of this technique using quaternions, allowing to use e.g. polarization as another signal attribute for diversity, has been discussed in several publications. However, there is still the open question how to design such coding matrices. In this paper, we present a generalized form of hypercomplex numbers used as basis for our computation allowing to generalize the notation of complex numbers and quaternions.

Experimental results show that our method is not only better than many of the current denoising methods in the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), but also obtained better visual effect. © 2012 Ming Yin et al.","citedby-count":"34","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002836","afid":"60002836","affilname":"Hefei University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Hefei","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8611278700","authid":"8611278700","authname":"Yin M.","surname":"Yin","given-name":"Ming","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002836"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56127197100","authid":"56127197100","authname":"Liu W.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002836"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55504189000","authid":"55504189000","authname":"Shui J.","surname":"Shui","given-name":"Jun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002836"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56093986900","authid":"56093986900","authname":"Wu J.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Jiangmin","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002836"}]}],"article-number":"493976","source-id":"13082","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84887078503"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84887078503?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84887078503&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84887078503&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84887078503","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84887078503","eid":"2-s2.0-84887078503","dc:title":"Detection of continuous-time quaternion signals in additive noise","dc:creator":"Navarro-Moreno J.","prism:publicationName":"Eurasip Journal on Advances in Signal Processing","prism:issn":"16876172","prism:eIssn":"16876180","prism:volume":"2012","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2012-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","prism:doi":"10.1186/1687-6180-2012-234","dc:description":"Different kinds of quaternion signal detection problems in continuous-time by using a widely linear processing are dealt with. The suggested solutions are based on an extension of the Karhunen-Loève expansion to the quaternion domain which provides uncorrelated scalar real-valued random coefficients. This expansion presents the notable advantage of transforming the original four-dimensional eigen problem to a one-dimensional problem. Firstly, we address the problem of detecting a quaternion deterministic signal in quaternion Gaussian noise and a version of Pitcher's Theorem is given. Also the particular case of a general quaternion Wiener noise is studied and an extension of the Cameron-Martin formula is presented. Finally, the problem of detecting a quaternion random signal in quaternion white Gaussian noise is tackled. In such a case, it is shown that the detector depends on the quaternion widely linear estimator of the signal. © 2012 Navarro-Moreno et al.; licensee Springer.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014586","afid":"60014586","affilname":"Universidad de Jaén","affiliation-city":"Jaen","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602299200","authid":"6602299200","authname":"Navarro-Moreno J.","surname":"Navarro-Moreno","given-name":"Jesús","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014586"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701415559","authid":"6701415559","authname":"Ruiz-Molina J.C.","surname":"Ruiz-Molina","given-name":"Juan Carlos","initials":"J.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014586"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101747848","authid":"7101747848","authname":"Oya A.","surname":"Oya","given-name":"Antonia","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014586"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36740107800","authid":"36740107800","authname":"Quesada-Rubio J.M.","surname":"Quesada-Rubio","given-name":"José M.","initials":"J.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014586"}]}],"authkeywords":"Detection | Quaternion random signals | Series expansion","article-number":"234","source-id":"15300154801","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84884623666"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84884623666?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84884623666&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84884623666&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84884623666","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84884623666","eid":"2-s2.0-84884623666","dc:title":"An interactive approach to designing planar parallel manipulators using image space representation","dc:creator":"Purwar A.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780791845035"}],"prism:volume":"4","prism:issueIdentifier":"PARTS A AND B","prism:pageRange":"589-604","prism:coverDate":"2012-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","prism:doi":"10.1115/DETC2012-70880","dc:description":"Structure equations of mechanisms are well-known to give rise to algebraic constraint manifolds that describe the space of poses available to a certain link (usually, end-effector or coupler) of open chains or mechanisms.

The performances of this algorithm are also discussed in terms of control accuracy, fuel consumption, number of RCT (reaction control thrusters) activations, missionization complexity, and robustness to system uncertainties. The control law of the proposed Quaternion Feedback Regulator (QFR) algorithm consists of linear error- quaternion feedback (proportional action), linear body-rate feedback with a feed-forward term (introducing an artificial damping factor, i.e. derivative action), and a nonlinear body-rate feedback term that counteracts the gyroscopic coupling torque. The quaternion error, considered in the control torque computation, represents the rotation that the LV shall perform to obtain the programmed quaternion. Both the control action gains can be related to the full inertia matrix and for this reason, the QFR algorithm presents fully MIMO characteristics. The independence of the closed loop dynamic behaviour from the LV inertia is guaranteed by a generic characterization of the control gains, valid and applicable for all mission types. In particular, the desired linear dynamic behaviour is obtained by tuning the proportional and derivative gain as function of damping ratio and natural frequency of an equivalent linear second order system. A dead zone prevents thruster activation when the error is within the expected performance, reducing the number of activations of the RCT valves. The selection of the dead-zone thresholds depends on the inertia matrix and the requirement. In this way, a particular criteria which takes into account these dependences, regulates the thresholds tuning. The thrusters and the vehicle dynamics are equivalent to a low pass filter reacting only to the mean value of the imposed torque, allowing to use a Pulse Width Modulated torque command signal. Starting from the desired torque, the thrusters assignment logic computes the PWM duty-cycle and respective opening time required for each thruster. Algorithm effectiveness has been assessed on a representative numerical simulation environment, considering the main critical flight phases for RACS function and key performance criteria (fuel consumption, number of activations and control accuracy). Algorithm robustness has been evaluated using a Monte Carlo analysis, against a set of uncertainties and dispersions on LV conditions, Mass, Center of Gravity and Inertia characteristics, RCT performances and sloshing models.

As part of it, a lunar lander demonstrator has been developed to verify the structure, propulsion, and control system before launching a lunar module to the deep space. After verifying the system, the demonstrator will be evaluated by the flight test. This paper deals with the path tracking controller based on thrusters for the demonstrator. For this, we first derive equations of motion considering the allocation of the thrusters and design the path tracking controller based on quaternion. The signal generated from the controller is continuous so PWPF(Pulse-Width Pulse-Frequency) modulator is adopted for generating on/off signal. For altitude and attitude determination, we use the Kalman filter assuming the sensors have only noise. Finally MATLAB simulation is performed for evaluating the path tracking ability and the final landing velocity. © 2012 by Korea Aerospace Research Institute.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60107434","afid":"60107434","affilname":"Hyundai Motor Group","affiliation-city":"Seoul","affiliation-country":"South Korea"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60080732","afid":"60080732","affilname":"Korea Aerospace University","affiliation-city":"Goyang","affiliation-country":"South Korea"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60068719","afid":"60068719","affilname":"Korea Aerospace Research Institute","affiliation-city":"Daejeon","affiliation-country":"South Korea"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100717527","afid":"100717527","affilname":"School of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering","affiliation-city":"Goyang","affiliation-country":"South Korea"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57199437901","authid":"57199437901","authname":"Kim K.","surname":"Kim","given-name":"Kwangjin","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60107434"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55801937000","authid":"55801937000","authname":"Lee J.","surname":"Lee","given-name":"Jeongsook","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60080732"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55716356000","authid":"55716356000","authname":"Lee S.","surname":"Lee","given-name":"Sangchul","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60080732"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"100717527"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403326189","authid":"7403326189","authname":"Ko S.","surname":"Ko","given-name":"Sangho","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60080732"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"100717527"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/41262273500","authid":"41262273500","authname":"Rew D.","surname":"Rew","given-name":"Dongyoung","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60068719"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/41261980400","authid":"41261980400","authname":"Ju G.","surname":"Ju","given-name":"Gwanghyeok","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60068719"}]}],"source-id":"21100246524","fund-acr":"KARI","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Korea Aerospace Research Institute","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84879934673"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84879934673?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84879934673&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84879934673&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84879934673","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84879934673","eid":"2-s2.0-84879934673","dc:title":"Rock grindability estimation based on the quaternion color extraction model","dc:creator":"Perez C.","prism:publicationName":"26th International Mineral Processing Congress, IMPC 2012: Innovative Processing for Sustainable Growth - Conference Proceedings","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"8190171437"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9788190171434"}],"prism:pageRange":"4198-4204","prism:coverDate":"2012-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","dc:description":"In mineral processing plants it is important to estimate rock composition, size and grindability to improve control of the grinding process. It is well known that variation in ore grindability and size distribution directly affects mills power consumption and throughput. This paper extends a general machine vision approach for on-line estimation of rock mixture composition using color information. Our proposed rock lithological recognition method requires the following steps: division of each image into sub-images, color feature extraction using the Binary Quaternion-Moment-Preserving thresholding technique (BQMP) and support vector machines (SVM) for classification. The BQMP thresholding technique splits the image in two and chooses representatives of each half using the histogram as features. The statistical parameters of the color data can be expressed using the quaternion moments into the representatives. This method can be recursively applied to the sub-images, obtaining 5x2n features in n iterations. Once the feature vector has been computed, each vector is assigned to one of three classes using a classifier. The method was tested on a database containing 20480 sub-images (64x43 pixels) of five ore types as follows: massive sulphide (MS), disseminated sulphide (DS), net textured (NT), gabbro (G), and peridotite (P). These ore types were assigned to three grindability classes: soft (MS), medium (DS and NT) and hard (G and P). The database was divided in 2 subsets: 15360 sub-images used for training and cross validation and 5120 sub-images used for test. The classification accuracy was compared with a method previously published based on a mixture of principal components analysis (PCA) for color, and wavelet texture analysis (WTA) for texture feature extraction. WTA-PCA approach reached a 76% accuracy in test while our BQMP method reached 90% of classification accuracy using only color features. Experimental results show that our proposed method yields excellent results compared to previously published results.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60122505","afid":"60122505","affilname":"Advanced Mining Technology Center","affiliation-city":"Santiago","affiliation-country":"Chile"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401782386","authid":"7401782386","authname":"Perez C.","surname":"Perez","given-name":"C.","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122505"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36602976900","authid":"36602976900","authname":"Navarro C.","surname":"Navarro","given-name":"C.","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122505"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57198120728","authid":"57198120728","authname":"Vera P.","surname":"Vera","given-name":"P.","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122505"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57196695467","authid":"57196695467","authname":"Schulz D.","surname":"Schulz","given-name":"D.","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122505"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56819248000","authid":"56819248000","authname":"Castillo L.","surname":"Castillo","given-name":"L.","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122505"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55585446600","authid":"55585446600","authname":"Saravia J.","surname":"Saravia","given-name":"J.","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60122505"}]}],"authkeywords":"Grindability estimation | Lithological classification | Rock classification","source-id":"21100244844","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84879620090"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84879620090?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84879620090&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84879620090&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84879620090","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84879620090","eid":"2-s2.0-84879620090","dc:title":"GPS-based attitude determination for a spinning rocket","dc:creator":"Chiang K.","prism:publicationName":"25th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation 2012, ION GNSS 2012","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781622769803"}],"prism:volume":"3","prism:pageRange":"2342-2350","prism:coverDate":"2012-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","dc:description":"An algorithm is developed for determining the attitude of a spinning sounding rocket. This algorithm is able to track signals with low availability duty cycles, but with enough accuracy to yield phase observables for the precise, 3-axis attitude determination of a nutating rocket. Raw GPS RF front-end data are processed by several filters to accomplish this task. First, a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) batch filter performs a least-squares fit on a bank of correlators to generate GPS observables for multiple satellites. These observables are then used as measurements in a Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother that optimizes estimates of carrier phase, Doppler shift, and code phase. Finally, attitude determination is carried out by another batch filter that uses the single-differenced optimizal carrier phase estimates between two antennas. The batch filter itself is a combination of a substantially modified form of the LMA and the Least-Squares Ambiguity Decorrelation (LAMBDA) method. It is configured to deal with integer ambiguities that are constantly changing due to the long data gaps between times of carrier phase availability. The algorithm presented in this paper is applied to recorded RF data from a spinning sounding rocket mission in order to produce attitude quarternion and spin-rate estimates. These results are confirmed by another set of quaternions and spin-rate vectors independently estimated from magnetometer and horizon crossing indicator data.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007776","afid":"60007776","affilname":"Cornell University","affiliation-city":"Ithaca","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/43760993900","authid":"43760993900","authname":"Chiang K.","surname":"Chiang","given-name":"Karen Q.Z.","initials":"K.Q.Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007776"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004139057","authid":"7004139057","authname":"Psiaki M.","surname":"Psiaki","given-name":"Mark L.","initials":"M.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007776"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57210837411","authid":"57210837411","authname":"Powell S.","surname":"Powell","given-name":"Steven P.","initials":"S.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007776"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55415882200","authid":"55415882200","authname":"Miceli R.","surname":"Miceli","given-name":"Robert J.","initials":"R.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007776"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/30967608400","authid":"30967608400","authname":"O'Hanlon B.","surname":"O'Hanlon","given-name":"Brady W.","initials":"B.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007776"}]}],"source-id":"21100403768","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84878626333"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84878626333?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84878626333&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84878626333&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84878626333","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84878626333","eid":"2-s2.0-84878626333","dc:title":"Bloch's theorem in the context of quaternion analysis","dc:creator":"Pedro Morais J.","prism:publicationName":"Computational Methods and Function Theory","prism:issn":"16179447","prism:volume":"12","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"541-558","prism:coverDate":"2012-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","prism:doi":"10.1007/BF03321843","dc:description":"The classical Theorem of Bloch (1924) asserts that if f is a holomorphic function on a region that contains the closed unit disk |z| ≤ 1 such that f(0) = 0 and |f_(0)| = 1, then the image domain contains discs of radius 32 - √ 2 > 1 12.

A collection of pose hypotheses is obtained when more than the minimum number of feature points required to uniquely identify a pose are available in both the images. The pose hypotheses - unit quaternion and unit translation vectors - lie on the double-struck S3 and double-struck S2 manifolds in the Euclidean 4-space and 3-space, respectively. Probability density function (pdf) of the rotation and translation pose hypotheses is evaluated by gridding the unit spheres where a robust, coarse pose estimate is identified at the mode of the pdf. Further, a \"refining\" pdf of the geodesic distance from the coarse pose estimate is constructed for the hypotheses within a grid containing the coarse estimate. A refined pose estimate is obtained by averaging the low-noise hypotheses in the neighbourhood of the mode of refining pdf. Pose estimation results of the proposed method are compared with RANSAC and nonlinear mean-shift (NMS) algorithms using the Oxford Corridor sequence and the robustness to feature outliers, image noise rejection, and scalability to number of features is analyzed using the synthetic data experiments. Processing time comparison with the RANSAC and NMS algorithms indicate that the deterministic time requirement of the proposed and NMS algorithms is amenable to a variety of visual servo control applications. © 2012 IEEE.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019228","afid":"60019228","affilname":"Air Force Research Laboratory","affiliation-city":"Dayton","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013959","afid":"60013959","affilname":"University of Florida","affiliation-city":"Gainesville","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35976665300","authid":"35976665300","authname":"Mehta S.S.","surname":"Mehta","given-name":"S.

Aiming at these problems, central difference Kalman filter (CDKF) based on Stirling interpolation formulation is applied to the low-cost aircraft attitude estimation system which is of less accurate and high noisy sensors. First, the nonlinear mathematical model of aircraft attitude based on quaternion is established, then CDKF is applied to attitude estimation. Experimental results with real flying data show that CDKF is superior to the commonly used EKF method and unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The algorithm not only improves the attitude estimation precision and stability effectively, but also avoids the computing burden of Jacobian matrices. In addition, it is more simple and easy to implement, because it has only one adjustable parameter instead of three in the UKF circumstances. © 2012 IEEE.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028512","afid":"60028512","affilname":"Civil Aviation University of China","affiliation-city":"Tianjin","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113038842","afid":"113038842","affilname":"Institut Supérieur de l'Aéronautique et de l'Espace","affiliation-city":"Toulouse","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35248270500","authid":"35248270500","authname":"Han P.","surname":"Han","given-name":"Ping","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028512"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55657588500","authid":"55657588500","authname":"Gan H.","surname":"Gan","given-name":"Haoliang","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028512"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25638342300","authid":"25638342300","authname":"He W.","surname":"He","given-name":"Weikun","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028512"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55994700700","authid":"55994700700","authname":"Alazard D.","surname":"Alazard","given-name":"Daniel","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113038842"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24721212900","authid":"24721212900","authname":"Defay F.","surname":"Defay","given-name":"François","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113038842"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6506092186","authid":"6506092186","authname":"Brière Y.","surname":"Brière","given-name":"Yves","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113038842"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude estimation | CDKF | EKF | Quaternion | SPKF | UKF","article-number":"6491658","source-id":"120046","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84876470631"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84876470631?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84876470631&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84876470631&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84876470631","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84876470631","eid":"2-s2.0-84876470631","dc:title":"DT-MRI interpolation: At what level?","dc:creator":"Yang F.","prism:publicationName":"International Conference on Signal Processing Proceedings, ICSP","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781467321945"}],"prism:volume":"1","prism:pageRange":"737-740","prism:coverDate":"2012-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICoSP.2012.6491592","dc:description":"This paper studies two levels of interpolation techniques for improving spatial resolution of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI): a) at the level of scalar gray-level images using anisotropic interpolation and b) at the level of diffusion tensor fields using Log-Euclidean interpolation and quaternion interpolation.

The 100 Hz inertial data from MEMS sensors and 5 Hz visual data from a CMOS camera (a small webcam) are fused by using extended Kalman filter (EKF). To synchronize data from the two sensing components (i.e., inertial sensor and vision sensor) and filter out high frequency noise, the inertial data are processed by passing it through a moving average filter in the data preprocessing stage. Moreover, features of a checkerboard image are extracted by using the Harris corner extraction algorithm, and the pose the webcam relative to the world coordinate could be thus estimated by using direct linear transform (DLT). In order to avoid the gimbal lock problem, rotation quaternion is preferred to represent the orientation of the overall system. For trajectory feature extraction, the obtained trajectories are first normalized to a 0.5×0.5 area through a linear normalization, and then the features are extracted by using a linear Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). The extracted data are subsequently sent to a dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm for recognition. The experimental results show that 92.3% accuracy can be achieved for recognizing hand written numbers from 0 to 9, where ∼100ms is required for recognition if hand writing speed is ∼137 mm/s. © 2012

reduction is a difficult task for ultrasound image processing because of low resolution and contrast. As a novel tool of image analysis, quaternion wavelet (QW) has some superior properties compared to discrete wavelets, such as nearly shift-invariant wavelet coefficients and phase-based texture presentation. We aim to exploit the excellent performance of speckle reduction in quaternion wavelet domain based on the soft thresholding method. First, we exploit the characteristics of magnitude and phases in quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) to the denoising application, and find that the QWT phases of the images are little influenced by the noises. Then we model the QWT magnitude using the Rayleigh distribution, and derive the thresholding criterion. Furthermore, we conduct several experiments on synthetic speckle images and real ultrasound images. The performance of the proposed speckle reduction algorithm, using QWT with soft thresholding, demonstrates superiority to those using discrete wavelet transform and classical algorithms. © 2012 SPIE and IS&T.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/47962202000","authid":"47962202000","authname":"Liu Y.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Yipeng","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56768579700","authid":"56768579700","authname":"Jin J.","surname":"Jin","given-name":"Jing","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57199479168","authid":"57199479168","authname":"Wang Q.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Qiang","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9636704800","authid":"9636704800","authname":"Shen Y.","surname":"Shen","given-name":"Yi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]}],"article-number":"43009","source-id":"25978","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"60901043","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84876048039"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84876048039?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84876048039&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84876048039&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84876048039","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84876048039","eid":"2-s2.0-84876048039","dc:title":"ICM: An efficient data association for SLAM in stochastic mapping","dc:creator":"Zhang S.","prism:publicationName":"2012 12th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision, ICARCV 2012","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781467318716"}],"prism:pageRange":"1042-1047","prism:coverDate":"2012-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICARCV.2012.6485301","dc:description":"In this paper, iterative classification matching (ICM), a novel practical data association method, is proposed. ICM is an iterative approach to solve the data association problem which reconsiders the established observation-feature pairing and applies the quaternion approach to yield a least squares matching vector. The map features which are not associated with any observations are updated then by the obtained least squares matching vector to weaken the influence of the inaccurate vehicle pose estimation. Finally, the updated feature set and the unassociated observations are taken as a group of new inputs to perform the iteration again. The iteration is terminated until the discrepancy in mean square error falls below a preset threshold specifying the desired precision of the matching. Results of simulation experiments show that the proposed ICM method is an efficient solution to data association. Unlike ICNN (individual compatibility nearest neighbor), ICM can provide a robust solution in both simulated and real outdoor environments. Simultaneously, the computational cost of the proposed ICM algorithm is much lower than JCBB (joint compatibility branch and bound). © 2012 IEEE.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022422","afid":"60022422","affilname":"Ocean University of China","affiliation-city":"Qingdao","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54406434600","authid":"54406434600","authname":"Zhang S.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Shujing","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022422"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8355392200","authid":"8355392200","authname":"He B.","surname":"He","given-name":"Bo","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022422"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55322640700","authid":"55322640700","authname":"Feng X.","surname":"Feng","given-name":"Xiao","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022422"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201553459","authid":"7201553459","authname":"Yuan G.","surname":"Yuan","given-name":"Guang","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022422"}]}],"authkeywords":"data association | ICNN | JCBB | SLAM","article-number":"6485301","source-id":"21100237208","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84875853761"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84875853761?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84875853761&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84875853761&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84875853761","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84875853761","eid":"2-s2.0-84875853761","dc:title":"The random monogenic signal","dc:creator":"Olhede S.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - International Conference on Image Processing, ICIP","prism:issn":"15224880","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781467325332"}],"prism:pageRange":"2493-2496","prism:coverDate":"2012-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467404","dc:description":"The monogenic signal allows us to decompose a two-dimensional real signal into a local amplitude, a local orientation, and a local phase. In this paper, we introduce the random monogenic signal and study its second-order statistical properties. The monogenic signal may be represented as a quaternion-valued signal. We show that for homogeneous random fields, we need exactly two quaternion-valued covariance functions for a complete second-order description. We also introduce a stochastic model for unidirectional signals and a measure of unidirectionality. © 2012 IEEE.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022148","afid":"60022148","affilname":"University College London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020238","afid":"60020238","affilname":"Universität Paderborn","affiliation-city":"Paderborn","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6507545514","authid":"6507545514","authname":"Olhede S.","surname":"Olhede","given-name":"Sofia C.","initials":"S.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022148"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192768373","authid":"57192768373","authname":"Ramírez D.","surname":"Ramírez","given-name":"David","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020238"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102970468","authid":"7102970468","authname":"Schreier P.","surname":"Schreier","given-name":"Peter J.","initials":"P.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020238"}]}],"authkeywords":"Anisotropy | homogeneous random field | isotropy | monogenic signal | quaternion signals | Riesz transform","article-number":"6467404","source-id":"144684","fund-acr":"EPSRC","fund-no":"EP/I005250/1","fund-sponsor":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84875746716"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84875746716?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84875746716&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84875746716&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84875746716","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84875746716","eid":"2-s2.0-84875746716","dc:title":"Neural network-based distributed attitude coordination control for spacecraft formation flying with input saturation","dc:creator":"Zou A.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","prism:issn":"2162237X","prism:eIssn":"21622388","prism:volume":"23","prism:issueIdentifier":"7","prism:pageRange":"1155-1162","prism:coverDate":"2012-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","prism:doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2196710","dc:description":"This brief considers the attitude coordination control problem for spacecraft formation flying when only a subset of the group members has access to the common reference attitude. A quaternion-based distributed attitude coordination control scheme is proposed with consideration of the input saturation and with the aid of the sliding-mode observer, separation principle theorem, Chebyshev neural networks, smooth projection algorithm, and robust control technique. Using graph theory and a Lyapunov-based approach, it is shown that the distributed controller can guarantee the attitude of all spacecraft to converge to a common time-varying reference attitude when the reference attitude is available only to a portion of the group of spacecraft. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed distributed controller. © 2012 IEEE.","citedby-count":"107","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030838","afid":"60030838","affilname":"Toronto Metropolitan University","affiliation-city":"Toronto","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"pubmed-id":"24807141","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14038430500","authid":"14038430500","authname":"Zou A.","surname":"Zou","given-name":"An Min","initials":"A.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030838"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402676359","authid":"7402676359","authname":"Kumar K.","surname":"Kumar","given-name":"K.
