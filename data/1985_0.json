The advantage of such a transformation is that the otherwise highly nonlinear controller can be implemented with parallel, systolic or pipelined microprocessor architectures. Such global linearization based on quaternion kinematics leads to a possible feedback singularity so that Gibbs vector kinematics is used instead. In practice limits on available actuators could still lead to unsatisfactory or unstable response. In the case of spacecraft maneuvered by momentum transfer devices, real-time command generation is possible by pointwise minimization of the sum of the squares of the norms of the 'next state error' of the equivalent system and the linear system input. This is possible by the use of a suitable discretization of the linear system. It is also possible to track a nominal trajectory, such as a critically damped harmonic oscillator response, by minimizing the square of the norm of the error between the actual and the tracked states. The required solution of a sequence of state-dependent constrained quadratic minimization problems could also be done instantaneously by current experimental sensor signal-biased nonlinear analog circuits.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000745","afid":"60000745","affilname":"University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign","affiliation-city":"Urbana","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102691608","authid":"7102691608","authname":"Dwyer T.","surname":"Dwyer","given-name":"T.

In the present note we show, first, that this formulation allows a straight derivation of the Hopf fibering of the sphere S3 (characterized by unit quaternions) having the base space given by the sphere S2 (characterized by unit vectors), and secondly that the KS-transformation allows the 'quantization of the symplectic manifold S2' in the sense of Souriau, the associated quantum manifold S3 having a contact structure given by the bilinear relation characteristic of the KS-theory. Furthermore, after presenting a natural extension of the hypercomplex KS-transformation to the full phase space of the Kepler problem, we show that this extension allows the quantization of the manifold of Kepler orbits of fixed negative energy (manifold diffeomorphic to the symplectic product S2×S2). The energy levels satisfy a well known quantum integrality condition and the associated quantum manifold is diffeomorphic to the product manifold S3×S3 quotiented by a suitable equivalence relation. © 1985 D.

The nonlinear relations between the direction cosine matrix and the quaternion are linearized, and a variant of the extended Kalman filter is used to estimate the difference between the quaternion and its estimate. With each measurement this estimate is updated and added to the whole quaternion estimate. This operation constitutes a full state reset in the estimation process. Filter tuning is needed to obtain a converging filter. The second algorithm presented uses the normality property of the quaternion of rotation to obtain, in a straightforward design, a filter which converges, with a smaller error, to a normal quaternion. This algorithm changes the state but not the covariance computation of the original algorithm and implies only a partial reset. Results of Monte-Carlo simulation runs are presented which demonstrate the superiority of the normalized quaternion. © 1985 IEEE","citedby-count":"245","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022403","afid":"60022403","affilname":"Technion - Israel Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Haifa","affiliation-country":"Israel"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005800275","authid":"7005800275","authname":"Bar-Itzhack I.Y.","surname":"Bar-Itzhack","given-name":"I.
