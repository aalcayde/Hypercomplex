Received signal strength (RSS) fingerprint positioning is immune to the cumulative error, but its poor radio signal propagation affected by indoor environments leads to a large positioning error. The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is widely applied to improve the two methods, but the approximation of nonlinearity still causes a large localization error. In this study, we propose a new approach based on neural networks for the Wi-Fi/PDR positioning fusion. The nonlinear mapping capability of back-propagation (BP) neural network is used to correct the EKF nonlinear approximation errors. Unlike the commonly used PDR algorithm, a series of pedestrian historical motion states are applied to train the long short-term memory (LSTM) and then make predictions. This method can significantly reduce cumulative errors in PDR. On-site experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average localization error of 1.18 m with 73% of the errors under 2 m, which outperforms EKF and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) by approximately 45% under the same test environment. Moreover, another fusion method using LSTM localization results as a priori information is described in this article. Different from the fusion at the resulting level of the previous method, this second method achieves the fusion at the algorithm level by limiting the Wi-Fi reference point (RP) search range through the LSTM localization results to reduce training and positioning time.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017060","afid":"60017060","affilname":"Central South University","affiliation-city":"Changsha","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57263221000","authid":"57263221000","orcid":"0000-0002-3514-9791","authname":"Yu D.","surname":"Yu","given-name":"Da","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017060"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7501679577","authid":"7501679577","orcid":"0000-0002-3505-4864","authname":"Li C.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Changgeng","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017060"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57214068340","authid":"57214068340","orcid":"0000-0002-2830-989X","authname":"Xiao J.","surname":"Xiao","given-name":"Jiaxun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017060"}]}],"authkeywords":"Indoor fusion localization | long short-term memory (LSTM) | pedestrian dead-reckoning (PDR) | Wi-Fi positioning","article-number":"2503514","source-id":"15361","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85142696061"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85142696061?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85142696061&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85142696061&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85142696061","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85142696061","eid":"2-s2.0-85142696061","dc:title":"A Unified Approach to the Synthesis of Hypercomplex-Valued CORDIC-Like Algorithms","dc:creator":"Dukhnich E.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering","prism:issn":"18761100","prism:eIssn":"18761119","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783031206306"}],"prism:volume":"971 LNEE","prism:pageRange":"1-10","prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-20631-3_1","dc:description":"A systematized analysis of such hardware-oriented computational algorithms as CORDIC-like algorithms for fast solving linear algebra problems in signal, image and speech processing is given.

Most traditional segmentation methods simply regard an RGB color image as the direct combination of the three monochrome images and ignore the inherent color structures within channels, which contain some key feature information of the image. To better describe the relationship of color channels, we introduce a quaternion-based regularization that can reflect the image characteristics more intuitively. Our model combines the idea of the Mumford-Shah model-based two-stage segmentation method and the Saturation-Value Total Variation regularization for color image segmentation. The new strategy first extracts features from the color image and then subdivides the image in a new color feature space which achieves better performance than methods in RGB color space. Moreover, to accelerate the optimization process, we use a new primal-dual algorithm to solve our novel model. Numerical results demonstrate clearly that the performance of our proposed method is excellent.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002798","afid":"60002798","affilname":"Chinese University of Hong Kong","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57954109100","authid":"57954109100","authname":"Wang T.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Tiange","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002798"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219751888","authid":"57219751888","authname":"Wong H.S.","surname":"Wong","given-name":"Hok Shing","initials":"H.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002798"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color space | image segmentation | primal-dual algorithm | pure quaternion | total variation","source-id":"21100201017","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85140490187"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85140490187?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85140490187&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85140490187&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85140490187","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85140490187","eid":"2-s2.0-85140490187","dc:title":"Facial Expression Recognition Using Hyper-Complex Wavelet Scattering and Machine Learning Techniques","dc:creator":"Vaijayanthi S.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems","prism:issn":"23673370","prism:eIssn":"23673389","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789811922244"}],"prism:volume":"428","prism:pageRange":"411-421","prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-981-19-2225-1_37","dc:description":"Human emotion recognition is an active research topic in analysing the emotional state of humans over the past few decades. It is still a challenging task in artificial intelligence and human–computer interaction due to its high intra-class variation. Facial emotion analysis achieved more appreciation in academic and commercial potential challenges mainly in the field of behaviour prediction and recommendation systems. This paper proposes a novel scattering approach for recognizing facial dynamics using image sequences. Initially, we extract the temporal information from the facial frame by applying a saliency map and hyper-complex Fourier transform (HFT). Later the extracted high-level features are fed to the scattering transform method and machine learning algorithms to classify the seven emotions from the MUG dataset. The performance of proposed wavelet scattering network was evaluated on four different machine learning algorithms and achieved a high rate of recognition accuracy in all classes. In the experimental results, K-NN exhibits the proposed architecture’s effectiveness with an accuracy rate of 97% for the MUG dataset, 95.7% for SVM, 93.7% for decision tree and 91.2% naive Bayes, respectively.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014340","afid":"60014340","affilname":"SRM Institute of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Kattankulathur","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/51564986400","authid":"51564986400","authname":"Vaijayanthi S.","surname":"Vaijayanthi","given-name":"S.","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014340"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56023631600","authid":"56023631600","authname":"Arunnehru J.","surname":"Arunnehru","given-name":"J.","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014340"}]}],"authkeywords":"Facial emotion analysis | Feature descriptors | Hyper-complex Fourier transform | Wavelet scattering","source-id":"21100901469","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85140468359"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85140468359?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85140468359&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85140468359&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85140468359","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85140468359","eid":"2-s2.0-85140468359","dc:title":"3D Reconstruction by Pretrained Features and Visual-Inertial Odometry","dc:creator":"Kunbum P.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering","prism:issn":"18761100","prism:eIssn":"18761119","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789811926341"}],"prism:volume":"913","prism:pageRange":"241-252","prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-981-19-2635-8_18","dc:description":"The goal of my paper is to create a new framework which provides sufficient semantic information for decision makings as a core component of applications such as SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping), robotics, AR (Augmented Reality), autonomous driving, etc. This framework does not provide dense point clouds. Rather, a scene is described with several features which the agent has been trained to recognize. Specifically, scenes are generated by extracting features from the space’s occupancy, the location of the light source, shape of the object, colors, and textures in the images. The extraction of the features is conducted by ensemble with deep-learning based feature extractors, traditional machine learning algorithms and image processing techniques. The deep-learning based feature extractors are trained by a supervised learning with data augmentation over 3D models; and the results of inferences are evaluated by a depth camera and retrained by unsupervised learning. Using existed methods it is difficult to utilize semantic information for unknown objects. But the agent in this methodology tries to describe them as much as possible by utilizing information trained in advance. For an odometry module, which estimates attitudes and positions, is implemented by a typical feature-based visual odometry methodology. The camera coordinate frame’s depth camera points and the pixel plane’s points are optimized by Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm after extracting a typical corner detection algorithm and tracking by an optical flow algorithm. Using several key-frames, sliding-windowed PnP (Perspective-n-Point), algorithms can be constructed. The visual odometry of the camera and the attitude estimation from the IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) are loosely coupled. An ARS (Attitude Reference System) is built with a quaternion based linear Kalman filter, and mainly compensates the rotation error of the sliding-windowed PnP algorithm for each frame. The positions of the recognized objects are also included in the PnP algorithm to cover up the lack of features due to the lack of light or motion blur, which are a major problem in feature-based odometry. Since the re-recognized objects’ positions anchor the odometry, the drift problem which commonly occurs can also be solved. This framework performs a rough 3D reconstruction by interpreting the scene with minimal computing resources, and obtains the location of the agent. Therefore, it offers a simple 3D map and a graph structure, as a by-product for applications using this framework, and provides the attitudes and positions of agents for each frame. For applications that do not necessarily require dense geometric results, I propose that this framework can be utilized as a flexible and versatile component with fewer computer resources.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025272","afid":"60025272","affilname":"The University of Tokyo","affiliation-city":"Tokyo","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57939221500","authid":"57939221500","authname":"Kunbum P.","surname":"Kunbum","given-name":"Park","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025272"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55754198600","authid":"55754198600","authname":"Tsuchiya T.","surname":"Tsuchiya","given-name":"Takeshi","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025272"}]}],"authkeywords":"Ensemble vision machine learning | Scene reconstruction | Scene understanding | SLAM | Visual-inertial odometry","source-id":"19700186822","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85139000262"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85139000262?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85139000262&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85139000262&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1746809422007108"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85139000262","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85139000262","eid":"2-s2.0-85139000262","dc:title":"Fusion of electroencephalograms at different channels and different activities via multivariate quaternion valued singular spectrum analysis for intellectual and developmental disorder recognition","dc:creator":"Lin Y.","prism:publicationName":"Biomedical Signal Processing and Control","prism:issn":"17468094","prism:eIssn":"17468108","prism:volume":"79","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"January 2023","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.bspc.2022.104256","pii":"S1746809422007108","dc:description":"This paper proposes a multivariate quaternion valued singular spectrum analysis (MQSSA) for fusing the electroencephalograms (EEGs) at four different channels acquired at two different states (the rest state and listening the smooth music state) together for performing the intellectual and developmental disorder (IDD) recognition. Here, the typical development control (TDC) is used as the control for performing the IDD recognition. First, the multivariate quaternion valued EEGs are formed using the four channel EEGs acquired at two different states. Then, the correlation coefficients between the various parts of the various rows of the MQSSA components and the various channels of the EEG acquired at the various states are computed. As the sum of these correlation coefficients reflect the similarity between the EEG and the MQSSA components, the MQSSA components are selected based on the sum of these correlation coefficients. Next, the features are extracted from the reconstructed EEGs. Finally, three classifiers are employed for performing the recognition. They are the support vector machine (SVM), the k nearest neighbor (kNN) and the random forest (RF). The computer numerical simulation results show that our proposed method does not only perform the fusion of the EEGs from four different channels acquired at two different states effectively, it also yields the high accuracy of the IDD recognition compared to the other EEG fusion methods and the methods without performing the fusion.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007155","afid":"60007155","affilname":"Guangdong University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57218477837","authid":"57218477837","authname":"Lin Y.","surname":"Lin","given-name":"Yuxin","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54894366300","authid":"54894366300","authname":"Wing-Kuen Ling B.","surname":"Wing-Kuen Ling","given-name":"Bingo","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007155"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57233535100","authid":"57233535100","orcid":"0000-0002-1874-9947","authname":"Wang W.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219595106","authid":"57219595106","authname":"Hu L.","surname":"Hu","given-name":"Lingyue","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007155"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57218475888","authid":"57218475888","authname":"Xu N.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Nuo","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007155"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57207735250","authid":"57207735250","authname":"Zhou X.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Xueling","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007155"}]}],"authkeywords":"Component selection | Feature extraction | Intellectual and developmental disorder | K nearest neighbor | Multivariate quaternion valued singular spectrum analysis | Random forest | Support vector machine","article-number":"104256","source-id":"4700152237","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"2017KCXTD011","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85137006240"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85137006240?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85137006240&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85137006240&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85137006240","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85137006240","eid":"2-s2.0-85137006240","dc:title":"Uncertainty Principles for Wigner–Ville Distribution Associated with the Quaternion Offset Linear Canonical Transform","dc:creator":"Urynbassarova D.","prism:publicationName":"Circuits, Systems, and Signal Processing","prism:issn":"0278081X","prism:eIssn":"15315878","prism:volume":"42","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"385-404","prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"January 2023","prism:doi":"10.1007/s00034-022-02127-y","dc:description":"Wigner–Ville distribution (WVD) associated with the quaternion offset linear canonical transform (QOLCT) (WVD–QOLCT) is the known furthest generalization of the WVD in quaternion algebra.

Then, to characterize the simultaneous localization of a signal and its WVD–QOLCT, we establish different UPs for the 2D WVD–QOLCT, such as logarithmic UP, Hardy's UP, and Beurling's UP.

Therefore, proposing a detection algorithm for such manipulations has become a key interest for investigators. Digital image splicing and copy-move are among the most commonly performed forgeries and their detection is problematic. In spite of the number of accessible potential solutions for manipulation detection, the increasing number of forgery cases and their complexity necessitate the need for improved detection methods. The technique put forward in this article aims to deliver a reliable remedy for image manipulation detection. In the presented article, a novel procedure for discovering forgery in digital images is proposed with the use of quaternions that expands the distinction between probability distributions of authentic and forged images. Quaternions help in representing the image in its entirety as a vector field and discrete cosine transform is applied on the quaternion that is constructed from the color components of the image. After that, Markov features are originated from the transitional probabilities of the inter-block and intra-block correlation amongst the coefficients of the blocks along four directions. Finally, a feature vector of 648 dimensions is classified using a fusion of various classifiers. The performance of the approach is presented in terms of seven different performance metrics. The experiments are performed on three benchmark datasets viz. CoMoFoD dataset, CASIA version 1.0 and CASIA version 2.0 datasets. The proposed approach beats existing approaches over the CoMoFoD dataset and yields competitive outcomes for the CASIA version 2.0 dataset.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60116744","afid":"60116744","affilname":"University Institute of Engineering and Technology","affiliation-city":"Chandigarh","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60113843","afid":"60113843","affilname":"Maharaja Ranjit Singh Punjab Technical University, Bathinda","affiliation-city":"Bhatinda","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188975386","authid":"57188975386","authname":"Walia S.","surname":"Walia","given-name":"Savita","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60116744"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26021294900","authid":"26021294900","authname":"Kumar K.","surname":"Kumar","given-name":"Krishan","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60116744"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26633172500","authid":"26633172500","orcid":"0000-0003-0115-1620","authname":"Kumar M.","surname":"Kumar","given-name":"Munish","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60113843"}]}],"authkeywords":"Decision fusion | Discrete transforms | Forgery detection | Fusion of classifiers | Image forensics | Majority voting | Markov process | Quaternions","source-id":"25627","fund-acr":"WBG","fund-no":"P154523","fund-sponsor":"World Bank Group","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85135067528"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85135067528?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85135067528&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85135067528&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85135067528","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85135067528","eid":"2-s2.0-85135067528","dc:title":"Image Authentication System Using Image Hashing with Color Filter Array","dc:creator":"Karsh R.K.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering","prism:issn":"18761100","prism:eIssn":"18761119","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789811919053"}],"prism:volume":"887","prism:pageRange":"239-251","prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-981-19-1906-0_22","dc:description":"The availability of sophisticated multimedia editing tools makes image authentication a challenge in the modern age of multimedia communication.

By employing the parameterized sequence as the kernel of the discrete transform, we construct a quaternion function space whose elements have sampling expansions. It is shown that the sample points of the sampling expansions are the eigenvalues of an associated quaternion difference operator. For the operator that has multiple standard eigenvalues, we provide a method to find the ‘missing sample points’. Through formulating the boundary-value problems, we make a connection between a class of tridiagonal quaternion matrices and the polynomials with quaternion coefficients. We prove that for a tridiagonal symmetric quaternion matrix, one can always associate a quaternion characteristic polynomial whose roots are the eigenvalues of the matrix. By representing colour image pixels as quaternions, an application of the proposed sampling theorem in colour image encryption is discussed. Throughout the paper, examples are given to illustrate the results.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023237","afid":"60023237","affilname":"Beijing Normal University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021751","afid":"60021751","affilname":"Wuyi University","affiliation-city":"Wuyishan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003078","afid":"60003078","affilname":"Zhejiang Normal University","affiliation-city":"Jinhua","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194324445","authid":"57194324445","orcid":"0000-0001-5529-5588","authname":"Cheng D.","surname":"Cheng","given-name":"Dong","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023237"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023237"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003837546","authid":"7003837546","orcid":"0000-0003-1924-9087","authname":"Kou K.I.","surname":"Kou","given-name":"Kit Ian","initials":"K.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8703188200","authid":"8703188200","orcid":"0000-0001-8918-3509","authname":"Xia Y.","surname":"Xia","given-name":"Yonghui","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003078"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56109877800","authid":"56109877800","orcid":"0000-0002-0220-5654","authname":"Xu J.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Junfeng","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021751"}]}],"authkeywords":"11R52 | 12E05 | 39A12 | 41A05 | interpolation | quaternion difference equations | quaternion polynomials | Sampling expansions | tridiagonal matrices","source-id":"24476","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"2019KQNCX156","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85132144031"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85132144031?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85132144031&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85132144031&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85132144031","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85132144031","eid":"2-s2.0-85132144031","dc:title":"Student’s Health Exercise Recognition Tool for E-Learning Education","dc:creator":"Shloul T.A.","prism:publicationName":"Intelligent Automation and Soft Computing","prism:issn":"10798587","prism:eIssn":"2326005X","prism:volume":"35","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"149-161","prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2023","prism:doi":"10.32604/iasc.2023.026051","dc:description":"Due to the recently increased requirements of e-learning systems, multiple educational institutes such as kindergarten have transformed their learning towards virtual education. Automated student health exercise is a difficult task but an important one due to the physical education needs especially in young learners. The proposed system focuses on the necessary implementation of student health exercise recognition (SHER) using a modified Quaternion-based filter for inertial data refining and data fusion as the pre-processing steps. Further, cleansed data has been segmented using an overlapping windowing approach followed by patterns identification in the form of static and kinematic signal patterns. Furthermore, these patterns have been utilized to extract cues for both patterned signals, which are further optimized using Fisher’s linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) technique. Finally, the physical exercise activities have been categorized using extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based neural networks. This system can be implemented in multiple educational establishments including intelligent training systems, virtual mentors, smart simulations, and interactive learning management methods.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60105817","afid":"60105817","affilname":"Al Ain

is a great demand for vision-based robotics solutions that can operate using Global Positioning Systems (GPS), but are also robust against GPS signal loss and gyroscope failure. This paper investigates the estimation and tracking control in application to a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in six degrees of freedom (6 DoF). A full state observer for the estimation of VTOL-UAV motion parameters (attitude, angular velocity, position, and linear velocity) is proposed on the Lie Group of (Formula presented.) with almost globally exponentially stable closed-loop error signals. Thereafter, a full state observer-based controller for the VTOL-UAV motion parameters is proposed on the Lie Group with a guaranteed almost global exponential stability. The proposed approach produces good results without the need for angular and linear velocity measurements (without a gyroscope and GPS signals) utilising only a set of known landmarks obtained by a vision-aided unit (monocular or stereo camera). The equivalent quaternion representation on (Formula presented.) is provided in the Appendix. The observer-based controller is presented in a continuous form while its discrete version is tested using a VTOL-UAV simulation that incorporates large initial error and uncertain measurements. The proposed observer is additionally tested experimentally on a real-world UAV flight dataset.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017592","afid":"60017592","affilname":"Carleton University","affiliation-city":"Ottawa","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191054010","authid":"57191054010","orcid":"0000-0003-2376-0603","authname":"Hashim H.A.","surname":"Hashim","given-name":"Hashim A.","initials":"H.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017592"}]}],"authkeywords":"asymptotic stability | autonomous navigation | localisation | nonlinear filter algorithm | tracking control | Unmanned aerial vehicle","source-id":"12342","fund-acr":"NSERC","fund-no":"DGECR-2022-00103","fund-sponsor":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85118662830"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85118662830?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85118662830&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85118662830&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85118662830","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85118662830","eid":"2-s2.0-85118662830","dc:title":"Fast Algorithms for Deep Octonion Networks","dc:creator":"Cariow A.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","prism:issn":"2162237X","prism:eIssn":"21622388","prism:volume":"34","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"543-548","prism:coverDate":"2023-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 January 2023","prism:doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3124131","dc:description":"This brief presents the results of a study of the possibilities of reducing the arithmetic complexity of computing basic operations in octonionic neural networks and also proposes new algorithmic solutions for efficiently performing these operations. Here, we primarily mean the operation of multiplying octonions, the operation of computing the dot product of two octonion-valued vectors, and the operation of multiple multiplications of an octonion by several other octonions. In order to reduce the computational complexity of these operations, it is proposed to use the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform, which is well known in digital signal processing. Using this transform reduces the number of multiplications and additions of real numbers required to perform computations. Thus, the use of the proposed algorithms will speed up computations in octonion-valued neural networks.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104305","afid":"60104305","affilname":"West Pomeranian University of Technology, Szczecin","affiliation-city":"Szczecin","affiliation-country":"Poland"}],"pubmed-id":"34739385","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55448045700","authid":"55448045700","orcid":"0000-0002-4513-4593","authname":"Cariow A.","surname":"Cariow","given-name":"Aleksandr","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104305"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55485269300","authid":"55485269300","orcid":"0000-0002-3859-484X","authname":"Cariowa G.","surname":"Cariowa","given-name":"Galina","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104305"}]}],"authkeywords":"Acceleration of calculations | deep neural networks | fast Walsh-Hadamard transform (FWHT) | octonions","source-id":"21100235616","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
