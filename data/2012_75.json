In this paper we propose a novel quaternion-based discriminant method. This method represents and classifies color images in a simple and mathematically tractable way. The proposed method is suitable for a large variety of real-world applications such as color face recognition and classification of the ground target shown in multispectrum remote images. This method first uses the quaternion number to denote the pixel in the color image and exploits a quaternion vector to represent the color image. This method then uses the linear discriminant analysis algorithm to transform the quaternion vector into a lower-dimensional quaternion vector and classifies it in this space. The experimental results show that the proposed method can obtain a very high accuracy for color face recognition. © 2012 Xu.","citedby-count":"23","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/110465216","afid":"110465216","affilname":"Key Laboratory of Network Oriented Intelligent Computation","affiliation-city":"Qingshuihe, Shenzhen","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"22937054","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57110954800","authid":"57110954800","authname":"Xu Y.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Yong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"110465216"}]}],"article-number":"e43493","source-id":"10600153309","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84865174462"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84865174462?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84865174462&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84865174462&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84865174462","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84865174462","eid":"2-s2.0-84865174462","dc:title":"A novel DFT based information embedding for color image authentication (DFTIECIA)","dc:creator":"Mandal J.","prism:publicationName":"Advances in Intelligent and Soft Computing","prism:issn":"18675662","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783642301100"}],"prism:volume":"167 AISC","prism:issueIdentifier":"VOL. 2","prism:pageRange":"763-772","prism:coverDate":"2012-08-24","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-30111-7_73","dc:description":"In this paper, a novel two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transformation based information embedding has been proposed for color image authentication (DFTIECIA).

We model iris representation problem as quaternionic sparse coding problem which is solved by convex optimization strategy. This approach essentially exploits the orientation of local iris texture elements which are efficiently extracted using a binarized dictionary of oriented atoms. The feasibility of this approach is evaluated, both for the recognition and the verification problem, on the publicly available visible illumination UBIRIS V2 database.

The first one is the n-D complex analytic signal Ψ(x 1, x 2, ..., x n) with a single-orthant spectrum defined by Hahn in 1992 as the extension of the 1-D Gabor's analytic signal. It is compared with two hypercomplex approaches: the known n-D Clifford analytic signal Ψ Cl and the Cayley-Dickson analytic signal Ψ CD defined by the Author in 2009.

The true locations of stars are obtained within the threshold scan windows of predicted locations of stars. The error between ideal locations of stars and true locations of stars would become larger due to the gyro drift, resulting in the decreased update rate of star sensor. So this paper puts forward a star tracking algorithm for star sensor with large angle velocity. In this algorithm, the angle velocity is calculated with continuous quaternion. Then the ideal quaternion of the next frame is calculated with current quaternion and angle calculated velocity. The ideal locations of stars in the star image of next frame are calculated with the calculated quaternion. The true locations of stars in the star image of next frame are obtained within the threshold scan windows of ideal locations of stars in the next frame.

Calculation using 3D geometric features and its corresponding 2D geometric features is a significant method to estimate camera poses. Given to this fact, a novel algorithm was proposed based on 3D to its corresponding 2D geometric features, aiming at estimating monocular camera poses. In this algorithm, rotation matrix was denoted by quaternion, and rotation parameters and translation parameters were obtained by constraint equation. Compared with the NLL algorithm proposed by Ansar, this algorithm was more effective in reducing the influence of image noise on pose estimation accuracy. Meanwhile, it can ensure the orthogonality of rotation matrix. The result of simulation experiment shows that compared with NLL algorithm, the new algorithm obviously presents stronger robustness, higher calculation accuracy and computational complexity. The validity of this algorithm is verified by an actual experiment.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027363","afid":"60027363","affilname":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023277","afid":"60023277","affilname":"Xi'an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191700134","authid":"57191700134","authname":"Li Z.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Zhe","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023277"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/18438569800","authid":"18438569800","authname":"Su X.","surname":"Su","given-name":"Xiuqin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023277"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204185351","authid":"57204185351","authname":"Hao W.","surname":"Hao","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023277"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"}]}],"authkeywords":"Geometric features | Pose estimation | Quaternion | Rotation matrix","source-id":"144789","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84867417063"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84867417063?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84867417063&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84867417063&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84867417063","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84867417063","eid":"2-s2.0-84867417063","dc:title":"Pressure-velocity joint DOA finding algorithm using quaternions","dc:creator":"He G.","prism:publicationName":"Wuhan Ligong Daxue Xuebao (Jiaotong Kexue Yu Gongcheng Ban)/Journal of Wuhan University of Technology (Transportation Science and Engineering)","prism:issn":"20953844","prism:volume":"36","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"712-716","prism:coverDate":"2012-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"August 2012","prism:doi":"10.3963/j.issn.2095-3844.2012.04.014","dc:description":"One deficiency of traditional MUSIC algorithm is the inability to deal with coherent signals.

Compared with the traditional MUSIC method, the quaternion-MUSIC algorithm has less memory space requirement and computational complexity and can deal with the coherent signals without any preprocessing method by taking the quaternion algebra's merits of compact handling of the data and higher orthogonality constraints. In addition, the new algorithm has a higher ability to restrain the isotropic interference by taking use of the coherence of pressure and velocity.

In this paper we propose using cross-correlations between Gabor wavelet coefficients at different orientations as a de- scriptor for aerial image classification. We extend our de- scriptor to color images using new quaternion representation based on symplectic decomposition. On currently the largest publicly available dataset of aerial images we show that the proposed descriptors obtain 85% correct classification rate thus improving state-of-the-art considerably. © 2012 Institute of Telecommunica.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104200","afid":"60104200","affilname":"University of Banja Luka","affiliation-city":"Banja Luka","affiliation-country":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6504241952","authid":"6504241952","authname":"Risojević V.","surname":"Risojević","given-name":"Vladimir","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104200"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8597226400","authid":"8597226400","authname":"Babić Z.","surname":"Babić","given-name":"Zdenka","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104200"}]}],"authkeywords":"Aerial image classification | Gabor filter banks | Quaternions | Texture analysis","article-number":"6208094","source-id":"21100205917","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84863685549"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84863685549?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84863685549&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84863685549&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84863685549","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84863685549","eid":"2-s2.0-84863685549","dc:title":"2012 IEEE Conference on Technologies for Practical Robot Applications, TePRA 2012","prism:publicationName":"2012 IEEE Conference on Technologies for Practical Robot Applications, TePRA 2012","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781467308557"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2012-07-16","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 30 papers.

However, in the presence of large illumination variation and serious noisy contamination, conventional approaches fail to generate accurate disparity maps. To have robust disparity estimation in these situations, we first propose a model -color monogenic curvature phase to describe local features of color images by embedding the monogenic curvature signal into the quaternion representation. Then a multiscale framework to estimate disparities is proposed by coupling the advantages of the color monogenic curvature phase and mutual information. Both indoor and outdoor images with large brightness variation are used in the experiments, and the results demonstrate that our approach can achieve a good performance even in the conditions of large illumination change and serious noisy contamination. © 2012 Optical Society of America.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60129321","afid":"60129321","affilname":"Key Laboratory of Embedded System and Service Computing, Ministry of Education","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34978044100","authid":"34978044100","authname":"Zang D.","surname":"Zang","given-name":"Di","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60129321"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221572573","authid":"57221572573","authname":"Li J.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Jie","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60129321"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36633595100","authid":"36633595100","authname":"Zhang D.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Dongdong","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60129321"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36995158700","authid":"36995158700","authname":"Zhang J.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Junqi","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60129321"}]}],"source-id":"12862","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84867438101"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84867438101?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84867438101&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84867438101&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84867438101","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84867438101","eid":"2-s2.0-84867438101","dc:title":"Underwater color image enhancement based on quaternion and fuzzy morphological sieves","dc:creator":"Yang M.","prism:publicationName":"Yi Qi Yi Biao Xue Bao/Chinese Journal of Scientific Instrument","prism:issn":"02543087","prism:volume":"33","prism:issueIdentifier":"7","prism:pageRange":"1601-1605","prism:coverDate":"2012-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2012","dc:description":"Underwater color image enhancement is an important issue in underwater vision field.

By setting the background pixels of the water areas of the processed images to gray or low saturation colors while remaining the object pixel color unchanged, the difference between background and foreground colors of the image is increased.

The mathematical framework of our method is based on trifocal tensor geometry and a quaternion representation of rotation matrices. A simple polynomial system is developed from which camera motion parameters may be extracted more robustly in the presence of severe noise, as compared to the conventionally employed direct linear/subspace solutions. This is demonstrated with extensive experiments and comparisons against the 3-point and line-sfm algorithms. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.","citedby-count":"13","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60085737","afid":"60085737","affilname":"Honda Research Institute USA, Inc.","affiliation-city":"San Jose","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026532","afid":"60026532","affilname":"Microsoft Corporation","affiliation-city":"Redmond","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57217189069","authid":"57217189069","authname":"Pradeep V.","surname":"Pradeep","given-name":"Vivek","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026532"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403453968","authid":"7403453968","authname":"Lim J.","surname":"Lim","given-name":"Jongwoo","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60085737"}]}],"authkeywords":"SLAM | Structure from motion | Tracking | Visual odometry","source-id":"72242","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84865388409"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84865388409?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84865388409&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84865388409&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84865388409","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84865388409","eid":"2-s2.0-84865388409","dc:title":"Algorithm for monocular camera/SINS integrated navigation based-on dual quaternion","dc:creator":"Feng G.","prism:publicationName":"Guofang Keji Daxue Xuebao/Journal of National University of Defense Technology","prism:issn":"10012486","prism:volume":"34","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"80-84","prism:coverDate":"2012-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2012","dc:description":"An algorithm of monocular camera/SINS integrated navigation is presented for structural road. In order to overcome the difficulties of point features matching and tracking, which are restricted by carrier velocity and camera view, line features are extracted from the lane marks on the road. The line features are represented by dual quaternion. Compared with the relative pose estimation algorithm based on dual quaternion, the proposed algorithm deduced the formula of image feature increment and camera position increment. After registration and time synchronization, the velocity computation difference between the SINS and the camera was chosen as observation of integrated navigation. A Kalman filter was used to correct the integrated navigation error including the camera scale factor error of velocity measurement. The experiment results show that the proposed algorithm is accurate for structural road.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024350","afid":"60024350","affilname":"National University of Defense Technology China","affiliation-city":"Changsha","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401641756","authid":"7401641756","authname":"Feng G.","surname":"Feng","given-name":"Guohu","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/18038624300","authid":"18038624300","authname":"Wu W.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Wenqi","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024350"}]}],"authkeywords":"Dual quaternion | Integrated navigation | Monocular camera | SINS | Structural road","source-id":"14644","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84864385097"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84864385097?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84864385097&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84864385097&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84864385097","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84864385097","eid":"2-s2.0-84864385097","dc:title":"Solution of exterior orientation parameters for high-resolution satellite imagery based on quaternion differential equation","dc:creator":"Gong H.","prism:publicationName":"Cehui Xuebao/Acta Geodaetica et Cartographica Sinica","prism:issn":"10011595","prism:volume":"41","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"409-416","prism:coverDate":"2012-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2012","dc:description":"According to analyzing the imaging mechanism of high-resolution satellite imagery, a solution of exterior orientation parameters based on quaternion differential equation is presented.
