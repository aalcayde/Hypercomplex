Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Owing to the limitations of imaging principles and system imaging characteristics, infrared images generally have some shortcomings, such as low resolution, insufficient details, and blurred edges. Therefore, it is of practical significance to improve the quality of infrared images. To make full use of the information on adjacent points, preserve the image structure, and avoid staircase artifacts, this paper proposes a super-resolution reconstruction method for infrared images based on quaternion total variation and high-order overlapping group sparse. The method uses a quaternion total variation method to utilize the correlation between adjacent points to improve image anti-noise ability and reconstruction effect. It uses the sparsity of a higher-order gradient to reconstruct a clear image structure and restore smooth changes. In addition, we performed regularization by using the denoising method, alternating direction method of multipliers, and fast Fourier transform theory to improve the efficiency and robustness of our method. Our experimental results show that this method has excellent performance in objective evaluation and subjective visual effects.",

Therefore, it is of practical significance to improve the quality of infrared images. To make full use of the information on adjacent points, preserve the image structure, and avoid staircase artifacts, this paper proposes a super-resolution reconstruction method for infrared images based on quaternion total variation and high-order overlapping group sparse. The method uses a quaternion total variation method to utilize the correlation between adjacent points to improve image anti-noise ability and reconstruction effect. It uses the sparsity of a higher-order gradient to reconstruct a clear image structure and restore smooth changes. In addition, we performed regularization by using the denoising method, alternating direction method of multipliers, and fast Fourier transform theory to improve the efficiency and robustness of our method. Our experimental results show that this method has excellent performance in objective evaluation and subjective visual effects.",
