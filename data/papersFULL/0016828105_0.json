This analysis begins in the retina and is continued as the information is passed on via the optic nerves to the lateral geniculate nucleus and from there to the visual cortex. All neurons investigated so far have been found to be influenced by rather circumscribed areas of the retina. Such an area is called the receptive field of that particular neuron. Receptive fields are usually not homogenous. For instance, the retinal ganglion cells, that is the cell bodies of the optic nerve fibres, have round fields with a centre that influences cell activity in the opposite way to that of the periphery. These cells are also concerned about the contrast in illumination between this region and its surroundings. In this way the original message is already altered in the retina. In the visual cortex of the brain, information coming from many ganglion cells is conveyed, via the geniculate, on so called simple cells in such a way that their receptive fields are oblong. Simple cells, therefore, discriminate orientation in addition to contrast. Simple cells project to complex cells in such a way that their receptive fields are sensitive to oriented stimuli but only if these are moving. Complex cells project to hypercomplex cells which are even more specialized to detect certain forms of moving stimuli, like wedges or angles.
