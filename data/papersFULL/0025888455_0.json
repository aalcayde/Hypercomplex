In the simplest implementation, MADS requires a magnetometer and an on-board computer, but all data processing can be done on the ground. Three-axis magnetometer measurements, in conjunction with the spacecraft ephemeris data and a geomagnetic field model, provide sufficient information to determine/estimate both the spacecraft three-axis attitude and the corresponding attitude rates. The MADS design incorporates an extended Kalman filter to combine the series of single-vector attitude measurements into a three-axis attitude estimate. The filter estimates an attitude quaternion, angular rates, and constant (slow random walk) disturbance torques. The filter explicitly models the spacecraft attitude dynamics by integrating Euler's equations and the quaternion kinematics. The covariance is propagated via a discrete-time equation, and the state transition matrix of the systm is derived via numerical differentiation with respect to the initial conditions of the system dynamics. The filter's attitude estimate has been compared with conical Earth scanner roll and pitch measurements, and the filter has been re-tuned to reduce its errors. With the data provided for this analysis, the LACE MADS is capable of 3σ accuracies of 1.8° in roll, 2.4° in pitch, and 2.8° in yaw. The limiting factors to accuracy with respect to the disturbances seem to be the ability to correctly model inertia parameters and the magnetically anchored damper. On the measurements side, the accuracy is limited by the ability to correctly model and/or measure the Earth's magnetic field. Filter convergence never seemed to be a problem.
