One of the drawbacks of using a long sequence of images is that the noisy images taken from a longer distance result in larger errors in 3-D reconstruction and, consequently, lead to a serious degradation in motion estimation. To overcome this drawback, the authors have derived a new set of Kalman filter equations for motion estimation in the quaternion representation. The measurement equation is obtained by analyzing the effect of white Gaussian noise in 2-D images on 3-D positional errors, instead of directly assigning Gaussian noise to 3-D feature points, and incorporating the optimal 3-D reconstruction under the consistency constraint. The state propagation equation is formulated by specifying the error between the true rotation and the nominal rotation in terms of the measurement noise in 2-D images. Actual rotation parameters have been computed from the estimated quaternions by the iterated least-squares method. Simulation results indicate that the Kalman filter equations derived are an accurate model for 3-D motion estimation, thus providing significant error reduction in the presence of large measurement noise in a long sequence of images, as well as allowing a shorter transition period for convergence to the true values.",
