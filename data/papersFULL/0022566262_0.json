A state-space model is constructed, incorporating both kinematic and structural states, and is appropriate for solution by either recursive or batch techniques. A set of object match points is assumed to be available, consisting of fixed features on the object, the image plane coordinates of which have been extracted from successive images in the sequence. The measured data are the noisy image plane coordinates of this set (or of a subset of this set) of object match points, taken from each image in the sequence. High noise levels (up to 20% of the object image size) are allowed.
