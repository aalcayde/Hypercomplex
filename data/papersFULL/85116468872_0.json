                "abstracts": "© 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.We propose a novel stereo laparoscopy video-based non-rigid SLAM method called EMDQ-SLAM, which can incrementally reconstruct thee-dimensional (3D) models of soft tissue surfaces in real-time and preserve high-resolution color textures. EMDQ-SLAM uses the expectation maximization and dual quaternion (EMDQ) algorithm combined with SURF features to track the camera motion and estimate tissue deformation between video frames. To overcome the problem of accumulative errors over time, we have integrated a g2o-based graph optimization method that combines the EMDQ mismatch removal and as-rigid-as-possible (ARAP) smoothing methods. Finally, the multi-band blending (MBB) algorithm has been used to obtain high resolution color textures with real-time performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms two state-of-the-art non-rigid SLAM methods: MISSLAM and DefSLAM. Quantitative evaluation shows an average error in the range of 0.8\u20132.2 mm for different cases.",

        "dc:description": "We propose a novel stereo laparoscopy video-based non-rigid SLAM method called EMDQ-SLAM, which can incrementally reconstruct thee-dimensional (3D) models of soft tissue surfaces in real-time and preserve high-resolution color textures. EMDQ-SLAM uses the expectation maximization and dual quaternion (EMDQ) algorithm combined with SURF features to track the camera motion and estimate tissue deformation between video frames. To overcome the problem of accumulative errors over time, we have integrated a g2o-based graph optimization method that combines the EMDQ mismatch removal and as-rigid-as-possible (ARAP) smoothing methods. Finally, the multi-band blending (MBB) algorithm has been used to obtain high resolution color textures with real-time performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms two state-of-the-art non-rigid SLAM methods: MISSLAM and DefSLAM. Quantitative evaluation shows an average error in the range of 0.8\u20132.2 mm for different cases.",
