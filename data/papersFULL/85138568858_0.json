                "abstracts": "© The Author(s) 2022.Multidimensional data are frequently encountered in numerous industrial systems, standard techniques regarding statistical multichannel prognostic methods naturally cannot fully exploit and capture the coupled nature and spatiotemporal relationship of the available information among channels. To alleviate a bottleneck problem, in this paper, a new approach named sparse-based fractional Levy quaternion extended Kalman filter (SFLQEKF) is formulated for the prognostic of stochastic time series. Initially, the stochastic time series is decomposed into the static component and the dynamic component resorting to the piecewise representation through a new improved sparse low-rank matrix (SLRM) approximation algorithm namely singular value penalty resonance sparse signal decomposition (SVP-RSSD). Afterward, both static component and dynamic component are predicted individually through the proposed fractional Levy quaternion extended Kalman filter (FLQEKF) method, the final time series of interest can be obtained by integrating the predicted static- and dynamic components correspondingly, in which a new predictive derivation of the proposed FLQEKF model is formulated for the first time by considering fractional-order characteristic and Levy flight process damping term, hence the issue of oscillating indeterminacy induced from classical extended Kalman filter (EFK) can be addressed. Eventually, the prognostic behavior of the proposed approach is investigated via the stochastic time series conducted from two experimental cases, the predicted results illustrate the availability and applicability of the proposed approach compared with three state-of-the-art benchmarks.",

        "dc:description": "Multidimensional data are frequently encountered in numerous industrial systems, standard techniques regarding statistical multichannel prognostic methods naturally cannot fully exploit and capture the coupled nature and spatiotemporal relationship of the available information among channels. To alleviate a bottleneck problem, in this paper, a new approach named sparse-based fractional Levy quaternion extended Kalman filter (SFLQEKF) is formulated for the prognostic of stochastic time series. Initially, the stochastic time series is decomposed into the static component and the dynamic component resorting to the piecewise representation through a new improved sparse low-rank matrix (SLRM) approximation algorithm namely singular value penalty resonance sparse signal decomposition (SVP-RSSD). Afterward, both static component and dynamic component are predicted individually through the proposed fractional Levy quaternion extended Kalman filter (FLQEKF) method, the final time series of interest can be obtained by integrating the predicted static- and dynamic components correspondingly, in which a new predictive derivation of the proposed FLQEKF model is formulated for the first time by considering fractional-order characteristic and Levy flight process damping term, hence the issue of oscillating indeterminacy induced from classical extended Kalman filter (EFK) can be addressed. Eventually, the prognostic behavior of the proposed approach is investigated via the stochastic time series conducted from two experimental cases, the predicted results illustrate the availability and applicability of the proposed approach compared with three state-of-the-art benchmarks.",
