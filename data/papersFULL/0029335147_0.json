Orientation and velocity selectivity and spatial-frequency characteristics of the excitatory zones of the same RF may differ between zones. The number of zones in RFs correlate with RF sizes: the more RF size the more zones number in them (r = 0.05, P < 0.02). About 66% of zones in RFs have approximately identical sizes (12-16 deg) and sizes those zones an dependence as from their number in RFs (r = 0.03, P > 0.05) as from the eccentricity (r = 0.3, P > 0.05). Zones in RF were distributed so that distance their centres was between 56-65 degrees (an average across all 60 degrees). If two or three zones were tested simultaneously the neuron changed own frequency and orientation tuning. Consequently the functional organization of neural RFs of prestriate cortex depend upon number simultaneously tested zones in spatial information processing. Was shown that important properties of prestriate cortex neurons is their ability to integrate and complex processing of spatial information across wide area of the visual field; in the prestriate cortex thus violate of straight retinotopical representation principle of visual field, characteristics of all investigated areas of visual system. The results represented in this review allow suppose that the structural and functional unit of cortex which make integration of spatial information from different compose this information is prestriate cortex neurons and not is no striate cortex modules. Consequently combined of neurons which make images description from different parts of visual field out of dependence of cortical area in turn integrate in neuron networks. Is known that neurons of any level have characteristics different of (from) characteristics of other levels visual system. The interaction of different elements of visual system form ultrastructure of RFs and their different zones in prestriate cortex, and ensure function of networks. So just on prestriate cortex neurons level appear whole system of surrounding world universe system of connections from different cortical areas which is morphological and functional base in process of spatial information integration RFs which have the central and peripheral representation.",
