Recently, quaternion multiple-input multiple-output OFDM has been proposed for high spectral efficiency communication systems, which can flexibly explore different types of diversities such as space, time, frequency, and polarization. This article focuses on synchronization techniques for DP-OFDM systems using a cyclic prefix, where the application of quaternion algebra leads to new improved estimators. Simulations performed for DP system methods show faster reduction of STO estimator variance with a double-slope line in the log-variance line versus signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) plot compared with single-polarization (SP) counterparts, and simulations for CFO estimates show a 3-dB gain of DP over SP estimates for same SNR values defined, respectively, for quaternion-valued or complex-valued signals. Cramer–Rao bounds for STO and CFO are derived for the synchronization methods, correlating with the observed gains of DP over SP OFDM systems.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029570","afid":"60029570","affilname":"Universidade Estadual de Campinas","affiliation-city":"Campinas","affiliation-country":"Brazil"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027294","afid":"60027294","affilname":"Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná","affiliation-city":"Curitiba","affiliation-country":"Brazil"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57359482600","authid":"57359482600","authname":"Hinostroza Ninahuanca J.L.","surname":"Hinostroza Ninahuanca","given-name":"José Luis","initials":"J.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029570"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57359723000","authid":"57359723000","authname":"Tormena O.","surname":"Tormena","given-name":"Osmar","initials":"O.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027294"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16643141600","authid":"16643141600","orcid":"0000-0002-5782-9608","authname":"Meloni L.G.P.","surname":"Meloni","given-name":"Luís Geraldo Pedroso","initials":"L.G.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029570"}]}],"authkeywords":"CFO | Cramer–Rao lower bounds | dual-polarization OFDM | OFDM synchronization algorithms | STO","source-id":"24783","fund-acr":"CAPES","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85119955947"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85119955947?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85119955947&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85119955947&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S016816992100541X"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85119955947","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85119955947","eid":"2-s2.0-85119955947","dc:title":"Agricultural machinery GNSS/IMU-integrated navigation based on fuzzy adaptive finite impulse response Kalman filtering algorithm","dc:creator":"Li S.","prism:publicationName":"Computers and Electronics in Agriculture","prism:issn":"01681699","prism:volume":"191","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2021","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.compag.2021.106524","pii":"S016816992100541X","dc:description":"This study uses global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning equipment and inertial measurement unit integrated with accelerometer and gyroscope to improve the accuracy and stability of the current agricultural machinery automatic navigation technology. Considering the actual motion state of agricultural machinery in operation, a fuzzy adaptive finite impulse response Kalman filter (FA-FIR-KF) algorithm was proposed to integrate position information and attitude information, and some necessary auxiliary optimization algorithms were introduced to make innovative improvements. The introduction of quaternion method can suppress the actual nonlinear problem of the agricultural machinery coordinate caused by the attitude angle. A fuzzy inference system was adopted to improve the adaptive adjustment ability to abnormal noise. A forgetting factor was adopted to reduce the system's excessive dependence on prior statistical information, so that the system can quickly track the abrupt signal. The algorithm simulation program was written on MATLAB, and the performance and effect of the proposed algorithm were verified through simulation and farm experiments. Simulation results of artificially added noise simulation data show that the localization precision in the Xn, Yn, and Zn directions increases by 38.95%, 38.88%, and 32.99%, respectively. This finding indicates that the FA-FIR-KF algorithm can effectively suppress the Gaussian white noise of the GNSS received signal and improve the positioning accuracy of agricultural machinery. The reliability of this algorithm applied to the automatic navigation system was verified through a tractor straight-line navigation experiment. The tractor conducts an automatic navigation test at a speed of 0.8 m/s. Under the GNSS differential state, the average error and root mean square error (RMSE) are 1.074 and 1.396 cm in filtering case and 1.17 and 1.551 cm in nonfiltering case, respectively. Under the GNSS nondifferential state, the average error and RMSE are 2.097 and 2.72 cm in filtering case and 3.663 and 4.633 cm in nonfiltering case, respectively. Compared with the nonfiltering case, the average error and RMSE reduce by 8.21% and 9.99% in the differential state and 42.75% and 41.32% in the nondifferential state, respectively. Test results show that the proposed algorithm can make the agricultural machinery track the desired path more smoothly, stably, and accurately than in the nonfiltered case, and the tracking accuracy is at the centimeter level.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013551","afid":"60013551","affilname":"China Agricultural University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/112850691","afid":"112850691","affilname":"National Research Center of Intelligent Equipment for Agriculture","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "8", "$" :"8"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193959967","authid":"57193959967","authname":"Li S.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Shichao","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013551"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56294527200","authid":"56294527200","authname":"Zhang M.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Man","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013551"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56537459800","authid":"56537459800","authname":"Ji Y.","surname":"Ji","given-name":"Yuhan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013551"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192638013","authid":"57192638013","authname":"Zhang Z.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Zhenqian","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013551"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202650333","authid":"57202650333","authname":"Cao R.","surname":"Cao","given-name":"Ruyue","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013551"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57354135600","authid":"57354135600","authname":"Chen B.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Bin","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013551"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57162704700","authid":"57162704700","authname":"Li H.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Han","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013551"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "8", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56574591700","authid":"56574591700","authname":"Yin Y.","surname":"Yin","given-name":"Yanxin","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"112850691"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive forgetting factor | FIR filter | Fuzzy inference system | Information fusion | Quaternion method","article-number":"106524","source-id":"30441","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"31571570","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85118857116"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85118857116?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85118857116&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85118857116&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1350449521003364"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85118857116","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85118857116","eid":"2-s2.0-85118857116","dc:title":"Quantitative analysis of multi-optical length NIR spectroscopy based on quaternion parallel feature extraction method","dc:creator":"Tan A.","prism:publicationName":"Infrared Physics and Technology","prism:issn":"13504495","prism:volume":"119","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2021","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.infrared.2021.103964","pii":"S1350449521003364","dc:description":"Near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) using multi-optical lengths is a very effective technique for quantitative analysis of mixture composition detection. Traditional chemometric methods build multi-optical lengths NIR quantitative model by representing multi-optical lengths NIR spectral data serially, which will also introduce noise and affect the predictive ability. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time a parallel express and feature extraction method based on quaternion signal processing techniques, which can greatly improve the performance of the multi-optical lengths NIR quantitative model. We measured the NIR spectra of the mixture solutions of Intra-lipid and India ink under 9 optical lengths that were 1, 1.15, 1.3, 1.45, 1.6, 1.75, 1.9, 2.05, and 2.2 mm, then we randomly selected three optical lengths NIR spectra to constitute an integral representation model by a pure quaternion matrix. Baseline correction pretreatment and data enhancement were performed and followed by Quaternion principal component analysis (QPCA) to obtain quaternion feature vectors. Support vector regression (SVR) was then employed to establish the quantitative model of Intra lipid in the mixture solution with volume percent from 6% to 10%. Compared with PCA-SVR for single optical length NIR data method, QPCA-SVR method for random three optical lengths NIR data significantly improved the accuracy of quantification. The determination coefficients of prediction (Rp2) are in the range of 0.9713 to 0.9882, which is remarkably higher than that of the PCA-SVR method for single optical length NIR data. The root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) are in the range of 0.1365 to 0.2215, which is appreciably lower than that of the PCA-SVR method. The research results show that the QPCA method can effectively improve the accuracy of multi-optical lengths NIR quantitative analysis, and has huge potential in multi-optical lengths quantitative applications.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019533","afid":"60019533","affilname":"Tianjin University","affiliation-city":"Tianjin","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018465","afid":"60018465","affilname":"Yanshan University","affiliation-city":"Qinhuangdao","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8979575900","authid":"8979575900","authname":"Tan A.","surname":"Tan","given-name":"Ailing","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57330189100","authid":"57330189100","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yunxin","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57330379700","authid":"57330379700","authname":"Guo T.","surname":"Guo","given-name":"Tianan","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202128236","authid":"57202128236","authname":"Hou X.","surname":"Hou","given-name":"Xingwei","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019533"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192414513","authid":"57192414513","authname":"Wang S.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Siyuan","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55726071000","authid":"55726071000","authname":"Zhao Y.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Yong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018465"}]}],"authkeywords":"Mixture composition detection | Multi-optical lengths | Near infrared spectroscopy | Quaternion | Support vector regression","article-number":"103964","source-id":"12121","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61971373","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85117491699"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85117491699?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85117491699&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85117491699&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85117491699","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85117491699","eid":"2-s2.0-85117491699","dc:title":"A new uncertainty principle related to the generalized quaternion Fourier transform","dc:creator":"El Haoui Y.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Pseudo-Differential Operators and Applications","prism:issn":"16629981","prism:eIssn":"1662999X","prism:volume":"12","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2021","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11868-021-00431-w","dc:description":"Motivated by the treatment of quaternion Fourier transform (QFT), the main purpose of the present paper is to characterize the spectrum of quaternion-value signals on the quaternion Fourier transform domain.

In this article, we introduce the affine projection algorithm (APA) in the GA domain to provide fast convergence against hypercomplex colored signals. Following the principle of minimal disturbance and the orthogonal affine subspace theory, we formulate the criterion of designing the GA-APA as a constrained optimization problem, which can be solved by the method of Lagrange Multipliers. Then, the differentiation of the cost function is calculated using geometric calculus (the extension of GA to include differentiation) to get the update formula of the GA-APA. The stability of the algorithm is analyzed based on the mean-square deviation. To avoid ill-posed problems, the regularized GA-APA is also given in the following. The simulation results show that the proposed adaptive filters, in comparison with existing methods, achieve a better convergence performance under the condition of colored input signals.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003977","afid":"60003977","affilname":"Northwestern Polytechnical University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57262587300","authid":"57262587300","authname":"Ren Y.","surname":"Ren","given-name":"Yuetao","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24342620300","authid":"24342620300","orcid":"0000-0003-1891-6298","authname":"Zhi Y.","surname":"Zhi","given-name":"Yongfeng","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57604242100","authid":"57604242100","authname":"Zhang J.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Jun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive filter | Affine projection | Colored signal | Geometric algebra | Hypercomplex process","article-number":"82","source-id":"15300154801","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"6142601200605","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85112671288"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85112671288?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85112671288&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85112671288&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85112671288","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85112671288","eid":"2-s2.0-85112671288","dc:title":"Uncertainty principles for the two-sided offset quaternion linear canonical transform","dc:creator":"Zhu X.","prism:publicationName":"Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences","prism:issn":"01704214","prism:eIssn":"10991476","prism:volume":"44","prism:issueIdentifier":"18","prism:pageRange":"14236-14255","prism:coverDate":"2021-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2021","prism:doi":"10.1002/mma.7692","dc:description":"The offset quaternion linear canonical transform (OQLCT) provides a more general framework for a number of linear integral transforms in signal processing and optics, such as quaternion Fourier transform (QFT), fractional quaternion Fourier transform (FrQFT), and linear canonical transform (QLCT).

For color image encryption, experiments are conducted on key sensitivity, histogram analysis, and noise attacks; while for color image watermarking, experiments are conducted on watermarking invisibility and the robustness on attacks of media filter, average filter, Gaussian filter, and geometric attacks.

The main research in this paper is the simulation of gymnastics performance based on MEMS sensors. In the preprocessing to reduce noise interference, this paper mainly uses median filtering to remove signal glitches. This article uses virtual character models for gymnastics performances. The computer receives sensor data from the sink node of the motion capture device through a Bluetooth communication module. The unit calculates the quaternion output from the dynamic link library of sensor data processing, calculates the rotation amount and coordinate offset of each sensor node’s limb, and uses the character model to realize the real-time rendering of the virtual character model. At the same time, it controls the storage of sensor data, the drive of the model, and the display of the graphical interface. When a gesture action is about to occur, a trigger signal is given to the system to mark the beginning of the action, so as to obtain the initial data of each axis signal of the MEMS sensor. When the gesture action is completed, give the system a signal to end the action. Mark the end of the action, so that you can capture the original signal data during the beginning and end of the gesture action. In order to ensure the normal communication between PS and PL, it is necessary to test the key interfaces involved. Because the data received by the SPI acquisition module is irregular, it is impossible to verify whether the data is wrong, so the SPI acquisition module is replaced with a module that automatically increments data, and the IP core is generated, and a test platform is built for testing. The data shows that the average measurement error of X-axis displacement of the space tracking system is 8.17%, the average measurement error of Y-axis displacement is 7.51%, the average measurement error of Z-axis displacement is 9.72%, and the average error of three-dimensional space measurement is 8.7%. The results show that the MEMS sensor can accurately recognize the action with high accuracy.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014070","afid":"60014070","affilname":"Hunan Normal University","affiliation-city":"Changsha","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57226354581","authid":"57226354581","authname":"Chen B.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Bingxin","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014070"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57226367634","authid":"57226367634","authname":"Kuang L.","surname":"Kuang","given-name":"Lifei","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014070"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57226359090","authid":"57226359090","authname":"He W.","surname":"He","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014070"}]}],"authkeywords":"Gymnastics performance | Inertial measurement unit | MEMS sensor | Motion capture","article-number":"47","source-id":"15300154801","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85108848007"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85108848007?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85108848007&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85108848007&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0096300321005427"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85108848007","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85108848007","eid":"2-s2.0-85108848007","dc:title":"Color image analysis with novel trinion decimal-order polar harmonic transforms","dc:creator":"Wang C.","prism:publicationName":"Applied Mathematics and Computation","prism:issn":"00963003","prism:volume":"410","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 December 2021","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.amc.2021.126453","pii":"S0096300321005427","dc:description":"Polar harmonic transforms (PHTs) are a kind of continuous orthogonal moments (COMs) that have excellent image description capability.

Firstly, the proposed QFr-GLMs are directly constructed in Cartesian coordinate space, avoiding the need for conversion between Cartesian and polar coordinates; therefore, they are better image descriptors than circularly orthogonal moments constructed in polar coordinates. Moreover, unlike the latest Zernike moments based on quaternion and fractional-order transformations, which extract only the global features from color images, our proposed QFr-GLMs can extract both the global and local color features. This paper also derives a new set of invariant color-image descriptors by QFr-GLMs, enabling geometric-invariant pattern recognition in color images. Finally, the performances of our proposed QFr-GLMs and moment invariants were evaluated in simulation experiments of correlated color images. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the value of the proposed QFr-GLMs and their geometric invariants in the representation and recognition of color images.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60089926","afid":"60089926","affilname":"Weinan Teachers University","affiliation-city":"Weinan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073708","afid":"60073708","affilname":"Xi'an Institute of Posts and Telecommunications","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020620","afid":"60020620","affilname":"Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016930","afid":"60016930","affilname":"Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56498362300","authid":"56498362300","orcid":"0000-0002-7667-9617","authname":"He B.","surname":"He","given-name":"Bing","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60089926"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016930"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205596462","authid":"57205596462","authname":"Liu J.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Jun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60089926"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203376397","authid":"57203376397","authname":"Yang T.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Tengfei","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073708"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201773066","authid":"57201773066","authname":"Xiao B.","surname":"Xiao","given-name":"Bin","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56482524700","authid":"56482524700","authname":"Peng Y.","surname":"Peng","given-name":"Yanguo","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60089926"}]}],"authkeywords":"Feature extraction | Fractional-order moments | Image reconstruction | Pattern recognition | Quaternion algebra","article-number":"17","source-id":"5200152707","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"XUPT-KLND201901","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85104621027"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85104621027?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85104621027&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85104621027&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85104621027","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85104621027","eid":"2-s2.0-85104621027","dc:title":"Quaternions-based detection of power quality events","dc:creator":"Kapoor R.","prism:publicationName":"Electrical Engineering","prism:issn":"09487921","prism:eIssn":"14320487","prism:volume":"103","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"2911-2927","prism:coverDate":"2021-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2021","prism:doi":"10.1007/s00202-021-01263-z","dc:description":"This paper presents a new method for the detection of voltage disturbances caused by various reasons in households and industries.

In FER studies, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention mechanisms have shown great advantages over traditional techniques. Although many attention-based CNN models have been developed, most of them are proposed to deal with grayscale images. For color images, these network models usually take their grayscale versions as the input or convert them to grayscale data by the first hidden layer. Furthermore, their attention modules focus on only grayscale information. This mechanism does not fully consider the correlation between color channels, which will degrade the performance of color FER. To alleviate these shortcomings, we introduce quaternion techniques to CNNs and propose a quaternion CNN integrated with an attention mechanism (QA-CNN) for color FER. The proposed QA-CNN takes into account not only the correlation between color channels but also expressional attention. The new attention mechanism is based on a multidirectional quaternion Gabor filter. Besides, the proposed QA-CNN reduces the number of network parameters by 75% compared with the real-valued CNN with the same structure. Experimental results on three widely used data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed QA-CNN by showing clear performance improvements over other state-of-the-art FER methods.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025761","afid":"60025761","affilname":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57071857400","authid":"57071857400","orcid":"0000-0003-1937-5331","authname":"Zhou Y.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Yu","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15922652500","authid":"15922652500","orcid":"0000-0002-8634-7026","authname":"Jin L.","surname":"Jin","given-name":"Lianghai","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56070558400","authid":"56070558400","authname":"Liu H.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Hong","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23767272300","authid":"23767272300","authname":"Song E.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Enmin","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attention mechanism | color facial expression recognition (FER) | quaternion convolutional neural network (CNN) | quaternion Gabor filter (QGF)","source-id":"21100784665","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61370181","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85121232810"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85121232810?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85121232810&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85121232810&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85121232810","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85121232810","eid":"2-s2.0-85121232810","dc:title":"Robust Image Hashing with Singular Values of Quaternion SVD","dc:creator":"Tang Z.","prism:publicationName":"Computer Journal","prism:issn":"00104620","prism:eIssn":"14602067","prism:volume":"64","prism:issueIdentifier":"11","prism:pageRange":"1656-1671","prism:coverDate":"2021-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 November 2021","prism:doi":"10.1093/comjnl/bxz127","dc:description":"Image hashing is an efficient technique of many multimedia systems, such as image retrieval, image authentication and image copy detection. Classification between robustness and discrimination is one of the most important performances of image hashing. In this paper, we propose a robust image hashing with singular values of quaternion singular value decomposition (QSVD). The key contribution is the innovative use of QSVD, which can extract stable and discriminative image features from CIE L∗a∗b∗ color space. In addition, image features of a block are viewed as a point in the Cartesian coordinates and compressed by calculating the Euclidean distance between its point and a reference point. As the Euclidean distance requires smaller storage than the original block features, this technique helps to make a discriminative and compact hash. Experiments with three open image databases are conducted to validate efficiency of our image hashing. The results demonstrate that our image hashing can resist many digital operations and reaches a good discrimination. Receiver operating characteristic curve comparisons illustrate that our image hashing outperforms some state-of-the-art algorithms in classification performance.","citedby-count":"14","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020464","afid":"60020464","affilname":"Guangxi Normal University","affiliation-city":"Guilin","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008691","afid":"60008691","affilname":"University of Shanghai for Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35243875800","authid":"35243875800","authname":"Tang Z.","surname":"Tang","given-name":"Zhenjun","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020464"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57210372515","authid":"57210372515","authname":"Yu M.","surname":"Yu","given-name":"Mengzhu","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020464"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/52464719400","authid":"52464719400","authname":"Yao H.","surname":"Yao","given-name":"Heng","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008691"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57210379355","authid":"57210379355","authname":"Zhang H.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Hanyun","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020464"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55199108500","authid":"55199108500","authname":"Yu C.","surname":"Yu","given-name":"Chunqiang","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020464"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56451233700","authid":"56451233700","authname":"Zhang X.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xianquan","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020464"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color space | Image feature | Image hashing | Quaternion matrix | Quaternion singular value decomposition (QSVD)","source-id":"23792","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"GuiKeAD17195062","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85119114554"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85119114554?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85119114554&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85119114554&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85119114554","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85119114554","eid":"2-s2.0-85119114554","dc:title":"Research on fast target positioning method of self-calibration manipulator","dc:creator":"Ye X.","prism:publicationName":"Symmetry","prism:eIssn":"20738994","prism:volume":"13","prism:issueIdentifier":"11","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2021","prism:doi":"10.3390/sym13112135","dc:description":"Hand-eye calibration and three-dimensional space target positioning are the keys to realize the automatic grasping of the manipulator. Aiming at the problems of a difficult camera manipulator calibration and poor real-time segmentation and positioning of stacked targets in industrial environment, a rapid target positioning method of self-calibration manipulator is proposed. Firstly, the spatial spherical autonomous path planning is carried out based on the quaternion linear interpolation method to calculate spatially symmetric path trajectory of the calibrator. The RGB-D camera mounted at the end of the manipulator is used to obtain multiple groups of RGB and depth images of the calibration plate. Combined with the position and attitude of the manipulator end, the internal and external parameters of the camera and the hand-eye conversion matrix are automatically calibrated. Then, based on KD tree algorithm, the holes in the point cloud are extracted to plan the shooting pose of the complementary image, and the target object is photographed from multiple symmetric angles. Combined with the iterative shooting pose of the manipulator, the rapid registration of the point cloud is realized and the complete outer surface model of the target object is obtained. Finally, the improved double pyramid feature fusion depth image is used to segment the RGB image through Mask R-CNN and mapped to the point cloud space, to achieve fast target segmentation of end-to-end 3D point cloud. The experimental results show that the eye-in-hand manipulator system can be self-calibrated to greatly simplify the calibration process and achieve the calibration accuracy of the traditional calibration method. The average error in each direction of the calibration result is less than 2 mm, which can achieve the acquisition accuracy of the vision sensor. It can also register and reconstruct point clouds for complex scenes in 1 s. The improved Mask-RCNN increases the segmentation accuracy of stacking objects by 8%. Compared with the physical error of hardware, the positioning error is no more than 0.89% and can meet the requirements of practical applications.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60108756","afid":"60108756","affilname":"Hubei University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/126076543","afid":"126076543","affilname":"Collaborative Innovation Center for Intelligent Green Manufacturing Technology and Equipment of Shandong","affiliation-city":"Qingdao","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195490686","authid":"57195490686","authname":"Ye X.","surname":"Ye","given-name":"Xuhui","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60108756"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"126076543"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222634779","authid":"57222634779","authname":"Tang Y.","surname":"Tang","given-name":"Yuxuan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60108756"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12784835000","authid":"12784835000","authname":"Hu X.","surname":"Hu","given-name":"Xinyu","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60108756"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24832547200","authid":"24832547200","authname":"Zhang D.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Daode","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60108756"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57717412400","authid":"57717412400","authname":"Chen Q.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Qi","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60108756"}]}],"authkeywords":"Mask R-CNN | Point cloud registration | Point cloud segmentation of stacked objects | Self-calibration | Trajectory planning","article-number":"2135","source-id":"21100201542","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"IGSD-2020-006","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85118875212"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85118875212?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85118875212&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85118875212&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85118875212","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85118875212","eid":"2-s2.0-85118875212","dc:title":"Attitude estimation algorithm of portable mobile robot based on complementary filter","dc:creator":"Liu M.","prism:publicationName":"Micromachines","prism:eIssn":"2072666X","prism:volume":"12","prism:issueIdentifier":"11","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2021","prism:doi":"10.3390/mi12111373","dc:description":"In robot inertial navigation systems, to deal with the problems of drift and noise in the gyroscope and accelerometer and the high computational cost when using extended Kalman filter (EKF) and particle filter (PF), a complementary filtering algorithm is utilized.

The experimental results show that the Mahony complementary filtering algorithm has less computational cost than the extended Kalman filtering algorithm, while the attitude estimation accuracy of these two algorithms is similar, which reveals that Mahony complementary filtering is more suitable for low-cost embedded systems.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018308","afid":"60018308","affilname":"Xi'an Jiaotong University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57299890800","authid":"57299890800","authname":"Liu M.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Mei","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018308"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401750645","authid":"7401750645","authname":"Cai Y.","surname":"Cai","given-name":"Yuanli","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018308"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57299370600","authid":"57299370600","authname":"Zhang L.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Lihao","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018308"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57329843400","authid":"57329843400","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yiqun","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018308"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude estimation | Complementary filter | Extended kalman filtering | Portable mobile robot | Quaternion implementation","article-number":"1373","source-id":"21100229176","fund-acr":"NKRDPC","fund-no":"2018YFB1700100","fund-sponsor":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85118618603"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85118618603?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85118618603&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85118618603&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85118618603","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85118618603","eid":"2-s2.0-85118618603","dc:title":"Non-Model-Based Monocular Pose Estimation Network for Uncooperative Spacecraft Using Convolutional Neural Network","dc:creator":"Huang H.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Sensors Journal","prism:issn":"1530437X","prism:eIssn":"15581748","prism:volume":"21","prism:issueIdentifier":"21","prism:pageRange":"24579-24590","prism:coverDate":"2021-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 November 2021","prism:doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2021.3115844","dc:description":"The pose estimation of uncooperative target spacecraft is a key technique in on-orbit servicing missions, among which the method based on monocular camera with low mass and power requirements has attracted widespread attention. However, monocular pose estimation methods mostly rely on the known 3D model of the target spacecraft, and non-model-based methods have low accuracy and even output the results when there is no target spacecraft in the image. In this paper, a non-model-based monocular pose estimation network for uncooperative spacecraft based on the convolutional neural network is proposed. This network uses three sub-networks to solve the problems of pose estimation and object detection. The first sub-network, called the attitude prediction sub-network, is used to predict the relative attitude of the target spacecraft by soft classification and error quaternion regression. The second sub-network, called the position regression sub-network, is used to predict the relative position of the target spacecraft by regression. The third sub-network called the object detection sub-network is used to detect the target spacecraft to determine whether the predicted pose needs to be output. The experimental results of the pose estimation of two public spacecraft demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively detect the target spacecraft and achieve better pose estimation accuracy than previous non-model-based methods.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010080","afid":"60010080","affilname":"Nanjing University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113193302","afid":"113193302","affilname":"Aerospace System Engineering Shanghai","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211242990","authid":"57211242990","authname":"Huang H.","surname":"Huang","given-name":"Haoran","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010080"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24537768600","authid":"24537768600","authname":"Zhao G.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Gaopeng","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010080"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57225711717","authid":"57225711717","authname":"Gu D.","surname":"Gu","given-name":"Dongqing","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113193302"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55630842200","authid":"55630842200","authname":"Bo Y.","surname":"Bo","given-name":"Yuming","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010080"}]}],"authkeywords":"convolutional neural network | monocular vision | Pose estimation | uncooperative spacecraft","source-id":"15047","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85118549434"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85118549434?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85118549434&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85118549434&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85118549434","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85118549434","eid":"2-s2.0-85118549434","dc:title":"Reproducibility of pansharpening methods and quality indexes versus data formats","dc:creator":"Arienzo A.","prism:publicationName":"Remote Sensing","prism:eIssn":"20724292","prism:volume":"13","prism:issueIdentifier":"21","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November-1 2021","prism:doi":"10.3390/rs13214399","dc:description":"In this work, we investigate whether the performance of pansharpening methods depends on their input data format; in the case of spectral radiance, either in its original floating-point format or in an integer-packed fixed-point format. It is theoretically proven and experimentally demonstrated that methods based on multiresolution analysis are unaffected by the data format. Conversely, the format is crucial for methods based on component substitution, unless the intensity component is calculated by means of a multivariate linear regression between the upsampled bands and the lowpass-filtered Pan. Another concern related to data formats is whether quality measurements, carried out by means of normalized indexes depend on the format of the data on which they are calculated. We will focus on some of the most widely used with-reference indexes to provide a novel insight into their behaviors. Both theoretical analyses and computer simulations, carried out on GeoEye-1 and WorldView-2 datasets with the products of nine pansharpening methods, show that their performance does not depend on the data format for purely radiometric indexes, while it significantly depends on the data format, either floating-point or fixed-point, for a purely spectral index, like the spectral angle mapper. The dependence on the data format is weak for indexes that balance the spectral and radiometric similarity, like the family of indexes, Q2n, based on hypercomplex algebra.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021859","afid":"60021859","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Firenze","affiliation-city":"Florence","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002838","afid":"60002838","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Siena","affiliation-city":"Siena","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/127175404","afid":"127175404","affilname":"Institute of Applied Physics (IFAC-CNR)","affiliation-city":"Sesto F.no","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205199602","authid":"57205199602","authname":"Arienzo A.","surname":"Arienzo","given-name":"Alberto","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021859"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"127175404"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004905120","authid":"7004905120","authname":"Aiazzi B.","surname":"Aiazzi","given-name":"Bruno","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"127175404"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005912959","authid":"7005912959","authname":"Alparone L.","surname":"Alparone","given-name":"Luciano","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021859"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004594292","authid":"7004594292","authname":"Garzelli A.","surname":"Garzelli","given-name":"Andrea","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002838"}]}],"authkeywords":"Data formats | Multispectral images | Pansharpening | Remote sensing | Reproducibility | Statistical quality indexes","article-number":"4399","source-id":"86430","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Università degli Studi di Firenze","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85118307184"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85118307184?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85118307184&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85118307184&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85118307184","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85118307184","eid":"2-s2.0-85118307184","dc:title":"A Quaternion Two-Stream R-CNN Network for Pixel-Level Color Image Splicing Localization","dc:creator":"Beijing C.H.E.N.","prism:publicationName":"Chinese Journal of Electronics","prism:issn":"10224653","prism:eIssn":"20755597","prism:volume":"30","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"1069-1079","prism:coverDate":"2021-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2021","prism:doi":"10.1049/cje.2021.08.004","dc:description":"Recently, Zhou et al. designed a two-stream faster Region-Convolutional neural networks (R-CNN) model RGB-N for color image splicing localization in CVPR2018.

Therefore, an improved quaternion two-stream R-CNN model is proposed to solve these drawbacks: a mask branch combining fully convolutional network and condition random field is added for locating spliced regions at pixel-level; quaternion representation of color images is used to process color spliced images in a holistical way. In addition, feature pyramid network based on quaternion residual network is considered to extract multi-scale features for color spliced images; attention region proposal network is combined with attention mechanism and is designed to pay more attention to the spliced regions; a high-pass filter designed for image splicing detection specifically is adopted to replace steganalysis rich model filter in the RGB-N to obtain noise input for the noise stream.

Unlike low-rank matrix completion (LRMC) which handles RGB images by recovering each color channel separately, QMC models retain the connection of three channels and process them as a whole. Most of the existing quaternion-based methods formulate low-rank QMC (LRQMC) as a quaternion nuclear norm (a convex relaxation of the rank) minimization problem. The main limitation of these approaches is that they minimize the singular values simultaneously such that cannot approximate low-rank attributes efficiently. To achieve a more accurate low-rank approximation, we introduce a quaternion truncated nuclear norm (QTNN) for LRQMC and utilize the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to get the optimization in this paper. Further, we propose weights to the residual error quaternion matrix during the update process for accelerating the convergence of the QTNN method with admissible performance. The weighted method utilizes a concise gradient descent strategy which has a theoretical guarantee in optimization. The effectiveness of our method is illustrated by experiments on real visual data sets.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222070456","authid":"57222070456","authname":"Yang L.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Liqiao","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003837546","authid":"7003837546","orcid":"0000-0003-1924-9087","authname":"Kou K.I.","surname":"Kou","given-name":"Kit Ian","initials":"K.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201452670","authid":"57201452670","authname":"Miao J.","surname":"Miao","given-name":"Jifei","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]}],"authkeywords":"Low-rank | Quaternion matrix completion | Quaternion truncated nuclear norm | Weights","article-number":"103335","source-id":"25592","fund-acr":"STDF","fund-no":"FDCT/085/2018/A2","fund-sponsor":"Science and Technology Development Fund","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85114122882"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85114122882?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85114122882&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85114122882&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0960077921007050"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85114122882","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85114122882","eid":"2-s2.0-85114122882","dc:title":"Quaternionic views of rs-fMRI hierarchical brain activation regions.

Quaternions make it possible to explore rs-fMRI brain activation regions in a 4D space in which there are varying brain activation intensities in spiralling activation cycles (each with its own intensity). As a result, there is a natural formation of multi-level cycles that form pyramidal vortex shapes with varying diameters. These pyramidal vortexes reflect the fractality (self-similarity) of clusters of similar multilevel brain activation region cycles. Using a computational topology of data approach, we have found that persistent, recurring clusters of spiraling cycles resulting from blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals in triangulated rs-fMRI video frames. Each brain activation region cycle is a cell complex, which is a collection path-connected vertexes that has no end vertex. Measurement of persistence of spiraling vortex shapes in BOLD signal propagation regions is carried out in terms of Betti numbers (counts of distinguished cycle vertexes called generators) that rise and fall over time during spontaneous activity of the brain. A main result given here is that every quaternionic brain activation region vortex has a free group presentation. In addition, we introduce 3D barcodes of brain activation videos that help visualize and quantify the fractality of clusters of multilevel vortexes arising naturally from triangulated brain activation regions in rs-fMRI video frames. We have made freely available downloadable archives of videos that exhibit the resulting clusters of spiraling brain activation cycles.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60086192","afid":"60086192","affilname":"Adiyaman Üniversitesi","affiliation-city":"Adiyaman","affiliation-country":"Turkey"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024438","afid":"60024438","affilname":"University of North Texas","affiliation-city":"Denton","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017367","afid":"60017367","affilname":"The University of Winnipeg","affiliation-city":"Winnipeg","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009697","afid":"60009697","affilname":"University of Manitoba","affiliation-city":"Winnipeg","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216732240","authid":"57216732240","authname":"Don A.P.H.","surname":"Don","given-name":"Arjuna P.H.","initials":"A.P.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009697"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35549460600","authid":"35549460600","authname":"Peters J.F.","surname":"Peters","given-name":"James F.","initials":"J.F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009697"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60086192"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003632034","authid":"7003632034","authname":"Ramanna S.","surname":"Ramanna","given-name":"Sheela","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017367"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56542908000","authid":"56542908000","authname":"Tozzi A.","surname":"Tozzi","given-name":"Arturo","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009697"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024438"}]}],"authkeywords":"Betti number | Brain activation region | Cell complex | CW space | Cycle | Free group presentation | Multi-level intensities | Quaternion | rs-fMRI | Shape | Vortex","article-number":"111351","source-id":"25347","fund-acr":"NSERC","fund-no":"194376","fund-sponsor":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85113458470"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85113458470?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85113458470&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85113458470&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0967066121002033"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85113458470","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85113458470","eid":"2-s2.0-85113458470","dc:title":"Geometric stochastic filter with guaranteed performance for autonomous navigation based on IMU and feature sensor fusion","dc:creator":"Hashim H.A.","prism:publicationName":"Control Engineering Practice","prism:issn":"09670661","prism:volume":"116","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2021","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.conengprac.2021.104926","pii":"S0967066121002033","dc:description":"This paper concerns the estimation problem of attitude, position, and linear velocity of a rigid-body autonomously navigating with six degrees of freedom (6 DoF).

Based on the definition of OCLCT, we extend the relationship between the LCT and the Fourier transform (FT) to the OCLCT and the octonion Fourier transform (OFT). Then explore related properties for the OCLCT such as shift property, inversion formula, isometry and Riemann-Lebesgue lemma. The relation between OCLCT and 3-D LCT is also builded. Moreover, based on these properties, we obtain Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and Donoho-Stark's uncertainty principle associated with the OCLCT.

However, due to the atmospheric turbulence, airborne HRWS-SARs inevitably suffer trajectory disturbances, which will consequently defocus the SAR image. Although various motion compensation (MoCo) methods have been proposed, they are mostly designed for the traditional single-channel SAR and, therefore, ignore the channel-dependent posture error. The posture motion error will introduce residual motion and time-variant channel errors, which not only defocuses the image but also causes azimuth ambiguity and degrades the SNR improvement of the final images of the azimuth multichannel and DBF-SAR, respectively. To solve these problems, a novel MoCo scheme for 2-D multichannel SAR systems is proposed. The posture error is described and calculated in matrix form through the use of quaternions. Then, the posture error is transformed into the translational motion error for each receiving channel and is subsequently compensated precisely. To address the residual aperture-variant motion error, a modified aperture-dependent MoCo is integrated into the proposed scheme.
