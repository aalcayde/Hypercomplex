First, L*a*b*color space is chosen as color feature, and the multi-scale quaternion Gabor filter is employed to extract texture feature of the given image. Then, the segmentation is formulated in terms of energy minimization with an iterative process based on graph cuts, and the connected regions in each segment are considered as the components of the segment in each iteration. In addition, canny edge detector combined with color gradient is used to remove weak edges in segmentation results with the proposed algorithm. In contrast to previous algorithms, our method could greatly reduce computational complexity during inference procedure by graph cuts.

Then, the output of optical head tracker (four IR cameras) is analyzed by non-linear/non-Gaussian Bayesian algorithm to provide information about the orientation of the user's head. The orientation is used to redirect the user toward a new direction by applying quaternion rotation. The output of these two sensors (video and audio) is combined under the sensor fusion scheme to perform continuous travelling inside the model. The maximum precision for the traveling task is achieved under sensor fusion scheme.

The experimental results show that the watermarking algorithm based on the improved QIM algorithm with distortion compensation achieves a good tradeoff between invisibility and robustness, and better robustness for the attacks of Gaussian noises, salt and pepper noises, JPEG compression, cropping, filtering and image enhancement than the traditional QIM algorithm. © 2013 SPIE.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016835","afid":"60016835","affilname":"Beijing Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55961290400","authid":"55961290400","authname":"An M.","surname":"An","given-name":"Mali","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55168846100","authid":"55168846100","authname":"Wang W.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Weijiang","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221109867","authid":"57221109867","authname":"Zhao Z.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Zhen","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image | Digital watermark | Distortion compensation | Quantization index modulation | Quaternion Fourier Transform","article-number":"89170M","source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84897803642"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84897803642?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84897803642&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84897803642&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84897803642","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84897803642","eid":"2-s2.0-84897803642","dc:title":"Polarimetric detection for vector-sensor array in quaternion Gaussian proper noise","dc:creator":"Wang Y.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the 2013 6th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, CISP 2013","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781479927647"}],"prism:volume":"2","prism:pageRange":"1164-1168","prism:coverDate":"2013-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2013","prism:doi":"10.1109/CISP.2013.6745232","dc:description":"The passive polarimetric detection problem for vector-sensor array is formulated based on quaternion.

This second watermark can resist geometric attacks and is used so as to invert such a transformation. Once the geometric transform is reversed, the meaningful watermark can be then extracted.

Then, in comparison with real-valued neural network, the proposed quaternion-valued neural network can provide higher classification accuracy. By this method, we generate successful classification images for detecting the lake, grass, forest, and town areas. The experimental results show that, by using quaternion-valued neural networks, the classification performance have been much improved. © 2013 IEICE.","citedby-count":"19","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025272","afid":"60025272","affilname":"The University of Tokyo","affiliation-city":"Tokyo","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55575500900","authid":"55575500900","authname":"Shang F.","surname":"Shang","given-name":"Fang","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025272"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35416951600","authid":"35416951600","authname":"Hirose A.","surname":"Hirose","given-name":"Akira","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025272"}]}],"article-number":"6705153","source-id":"21100286853","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84893867762"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84893867762?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84893867762&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84893867762&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84893867762","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84893867762","eid":"2-s2.0-84893867762","dc:title":"Auto-registration of aerial imagery and airborne LiDAR data based on structure feature","dc:creator":"Xu J.","prism:publicationName":"Hongwai yu Jiguang Gongcheng/Infrared and Laser Engineering","prism:issn":"10072276","prism:volume":"42","prism:issueIdentifier":"12","prism:pageRange":"3502-3508","prism:coverDate":"2013-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2013","dc:description":"Current algorithms of registration of aerial imagery with airborne LiDAR data has the major issue of strong dependency upon the matching feature, so these methods are impressionable to the texture feature of image and the density of LiDAR point cloud. A new method of auto-registration of aerial imagery with airborne LiDAR data based on structure feature was proposed. The first step was the automated extraction of structure feature from LiDAR range image and aerial imagery. After that the LiDAR structure features were projected onto aerial imagery and corresponding features were determined using geometry constraints. The second step was the wrong matches eliminating by two points geometric constraint after calculating the DLT parameters as the initial value, and iteration strategy was adopted to obtain optimal results. The last step was the pose parameters calculated by the optimal matching results using quaternion-based solution of space resection.

In this paper, we discuss the existing problems of example-based technique using scale space analysis. Accordingly, a robust pixel classification method is designed based on the phase congruency model in scale space, which can effectively divide images into edges, textures and flat regions. Then a super-resolution framework is proposed, which can adaptively emphasize the importance of high-frequency residuals in structural examples and scale invariant fractal property in textural regions.

Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of histopathology images has become an important research area in diagnostic pathology. This paper presents a scheme to improve the accuracy of existing CAD systems for Gleason grading on digital biopsy slides by combining color and multi-scale information using quaternion algebra. The distinguishing features of presented algorithm are: 1) use of the quaternion wavelet transform and modified local binary patterns for the analysis of image texture in regions of interest; 2) A two-stage classification method: (a) a quaternion neural network with a new high-speed learning algorithm used for multiclass classification, and (b) several binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers used for classification refinement. In order to evaluate performance, hold-one-out cross validation is applied to a data set of 71 images of prostatic carcinomas belonging to Gleason grades 3, 4 and 5. The developed system assigns the correct Gleason grade in 98.87% of test cases and outperforms other published automatic Gleason grading systems. Moreover, averaged over all the classes, testing of the proposed method shows a specificity rate of 0.990 and a sensitivity rate of 0.967. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed scheme can help pathologists and radiologists diagnose prostate cancer more efficiently and with better reproducability. © 2013 IEEE.","citedby-count":"40","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708","afid":"60012708","affilname":"Stanford University","affiliation-city":"Palo Alto","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003212","afid":"60003212","affilname":"The University of Texas at San Antonio","affiliation-city":"San Antonio","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24821353300","authid":"24821353300","authname":"Greenblatt A.","surname":"Greenblatt","given-name":"Aaron","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012708"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55814148300","authid":"55814148300","authname":"Mosquera-Lopez C.","surname":"Mosquera-Lopez","given-name":"Clara","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003212"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003395533","authid":"7003395533","authname":"Agaian S.","surname":"Agaian","given-name":"Sos","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003212"}]}],"authkeywords":"Automated gleason grading | Neural network | Prostate cancer | Quaternion | Wavelet transform","article-number":"6721952","source-id":"21100286344","fund-acr":"NSF","fund-no":"RD-0932339","fund-sponsor":"National Science Foundation","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84893411345"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84893411345?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84893411345&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84893411345&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84893411345","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84893411345","eid":"2-s2.0-84893411345","dc:title":"Desert vehicle detection based on adaptive visual attention and neural network","dc:creator":"Zhang J.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783642420412"}],"prism:volume":"8227 LNCS","prism:issueIdentifier":"PART 2","prism:pageRange":"376-383","prism:coverDate":"2013-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2013","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-42042-9_47","dc:description":"This paper proposes a novel desert vehicle detection method using adaptive visual attention model and pulse coupled neural network.

Compared with local binary patterns (LBP) and directional binary code (DBC), DLBP contains more information on both edge and texture.

The proposed approach was applied to fuse multispectral palmprint images captured under red, green, blue and near-infrared (NIR) lighting sources for personal identification. Experimental results suggest that the proposed algorithm performs much better than DBC, LBP and PalmCode in identifying palmprint images captured using different illuminations.

In the case of 1D signals, the analytic signal is typically computed using the Hilbert transform. Such complex representation allows us to compute the phase and magnitude of the signal. For high-dimension signals, the Riesz transform and partial Hilbert transforms have been used as extensions of the analytic signal to compute the local phase and local orientation. A major goal of this work is to highlight the role of an atomic function (AF) up(x) as a kernel for the Hilbert and Riesz transforms. It is well known that the use of phase information has a big potential because it is invariant to illumination and rotations. In this regard, we show the advantages to carry out computations of local Riesz phase using the atomic function instead of the classical global-phase approach. In addition, we explain how the atomic function up(x), formulated in the quaternionic algebra framework, can be used as a building block to perform multiple analytical operations commonly used in image processing, such as low-pass filter, derivatives, local phase processing, steering quaternionic filters, multi-resolution analysis and symmetries detection. © 2013 Springer Basel.","citedby-count":"2","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36667039500","authid":"36667039500","authname":"Moya-Sánchez E.","surname":"Moya-Sánchez","given-name":"E.

The recently developed concept of two side fractional quaternion Fourier transform (FRQFT) based on quaternion algebra and FRFT has been found useful for signal and image processing. It is a generalization of the quaternion Fourier transform (QFT). Many properties of the FRQFT are already known, but an extension of the QFT's Plancherel theorem is still missing. The purpose of this paper is to introduce extensions of this theorem. Firstly, we establish scalar value Plancherel theorem for the FRQFT. Then, the concept of right side fractional quaternion Fourier transform (FRQFTr) is proposed. Furthermore, we establish quaternion value Plancherel theorem for the FRQFTr. The Plancherel theorems in QFT domain are shown to be special cases of the achieved results. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.
