Ninety percent of the cells recorded (296/327) were responsive to visual stimulation. The majority (95%, 281/296) responded to moving images and were classified as complex (44%), simple (27%), hypercomplex (13%) and non-oriented (16%) according to criteria previously established for cortical cells in the cat and monkey. The remaining 5% of the neurons responded only to stationary stimuli flashed on-off in their receptive field. Results of this study indicate that neurons of the rat visual cortex have properties similar to those of cells in the striate cortex of more 'visual' mammals.
