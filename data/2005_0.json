Firstly, an efficient multi-view 2D face alignment algorithm is utilized to localize the facial points of the face images; and then the intrinsic shape and texture models are inferred by the proposed Syncretized Shape Model (SSM) and Syncretized Texture Model (STM), respectively. Compared with other related works, our proposed algorithm has the following characteristics: 1) the inferred shape and texture are more realistic owing to the constraints and co-enhancement among the multiple images; 2) it is fully automatic, without any user interaction; and 3) the shape and pose parameter estimation is efficient via EM approach and unit quaternion based pose representation, and is also robust as a result of the dynamic correspondence approach. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm for 3D face reconstruction. © 2005 IEEE.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60098464","afid":"60098464","affilname":"Microsoft Research Asia","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019118","afid":"60019118","affilname":"University of Science and Technology of China","affiliation-city":"Hefei","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/17347274000","authid":"17347274000","authname":"Wang C.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Changhu","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019118"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/11939875400","authid":"11939875400","authname":"Yan S.","surname":"Yan","given-name":"Shuicheng","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60098464"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201414329","authid":"7201414329","authname":"Zhang H.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Hongjiang","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60098464"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36071778600","authid":"36071778600","authname":"Ma W.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Weiying","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60098464"}]}],"authkeywords":"And Syncretized Texture Model | Morphable 3D Model | Realistic 3D Face Modeling | Syncretized Shape Model","article-number":"1385985","source-id":"21100277859","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33847796840"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33847796840?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33847796840&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33847796840&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33847796840","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:33847796840","eid":"2-s2.0-33847796840","dc:title":"Design of hypercomplex allpass-based paraunitary filter banks applying reduced biquaternions","dc:creator":"Alfsmann D.","prism:publicationName":"EUROCON 2005 - The International Conference on Computer as a Tool","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"142440049X"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781424400492"}],"prism:volume":"I","prism:pageRange":"92-95","prism:coverDate":"2005-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2005","dc:description":"A novel approach to the design of digital IIR four-channel hypercomplex filter banks is presented, which consists of a first-order allpass sections' cascade described with reduced biquaternions.

It is different from the current uncalibrated matching techniques, most of which obtain 2D dense disparity map after the epipolar geometry has been recovered. In this paper, the disparity is directly estimated by simply establishing correspondences between quaternionic phase structures of two QWF (quaternion wavelet filtered) images. Real and short-length biorthogonal wavelet bases are exploited to build linear-phase quaternion wavelet filters (LPQWFs). Once phases are extracted from the QWF image pair, the disparity estimation is formed as a minimization process of a cost function, which is formulated as a similarity measure for comparing quaternion wavelet phases. With regard to the mismatches near phase singularities, phase stability constraints are imposed on cost aggregation stage. And multi-scale matching strategy is introduced to avoid phase wrapping problem and improve convergence speed. The experimental results are encouraging in various image pairs. © 2005 IEEE.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025084","afid":"60025084","affilname":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55695017800","authid":"55695017800","authname":"Xu Y.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Yi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56203158200","authid":"56203158200","authname":"Zhou J.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Jun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15847120000","authid":"15847120000","authname":"Zhai G.","surname":"Zhai","given-name":"Guangtao","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025084"}]}],"article-number":"1579887","source-id":"26058","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33750115594"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33750115594?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33750115594&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33750115594&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33750115594","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:33750115594","eid":"2-s2.0-33750115594","dc:title":"Two-dimensional harmonic retrieval in gaussian noise based on hypercomplex","dc:creator":"Wu Y.","prism:publicationName":"ISCIT 2005 - International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies 2005, Proceedings","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"0780395387"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780780395381"}],"prism:volume":"I","prism:pageRange":"1381-1384","prism:coverDate":"2005-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2005","prism:doi":"10.1109/ISCIT.2005.1567138","dc:description":"The complex signal of two dimensional harmonics is common.

The wavelet decomposition of the face image leads to a wavelet subband representation, which contains four subband images corresponding to four orthogonal channels. These four subbands can be encoded into a 2-D quaternion number array. The quaternion correlation filter method is developed for performing pattern recognition on multichannel 2-D signal jointly. The proposed method has been shown to achieve significant improvement in face recognition results compared to traditional advanced correlation filter method for handling illumination variations of face images. We experimented with the CMU PIE database consisting of 65 people with 21 illumination variations per person, showing that our method can achieve close to 100% recognition accuracy using just a single training image of a person under neutral frontal lighting and testing on all other un-seen harsh illuminations. © 2005 IEEE.","citedby-count":"28","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027950","afid":"60027950","affilname":"Carnegie Mellon University","affiliation-city":"Pittsburgh","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401934574","authid":"7401934574","authname":"Xie C.","surname":"Xie","given-name":"Chunyan","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027950"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603557177","authid":"6603557177","authname":"Savvides M.","surname":"Savvides","given-name":"Marios","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027950"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35779178500","authid":"35779178500","authname":"Vijaya Kumar B.","surname":"Vijaya Kumar","given-name":"B.

One of the antennas serves as a main antenna and its output is used to compute position. Two additional antennas provide measurements for attitude determination. The tracking channels are configurable, and consequently, the same receiver can be used with one, 2, or 3 antennas. Currently, the main antenna can be dualfrequency, while the auxiliary antennas are single-frequency only. Attitude determination in the PolaRx2@ is therefore based only on LI code/phase measurements. This paper focuses on two methods that can be used for attitude determination based on GPS measurements only. The first method uses a Kalman filter in which double-differenced phase and pseudorange measurements are used to determine the positions of the auxiliary antennas relative to the main antenna in the local-level navigation frame. The attitude angles are computed based on these relative positions. This method is known as Direct Computation Method (DCM) and is currently implemented in the PolaRx2@. The second method uses a Kalman filter in which double-differenced phase and pseudorange measurements are used to directly determine attitude angles expressed as quaternion. This method requires a priori knowledge of the antenna positions in the vehicle frame, which are determined using a calibration procedure. This method is currently under development and is referred to as the quaternion-based Kalman filter. In this paper, both attitude determination methods are described, and their performance is compared using simulated error-free measurements. Static tests are used to obtain the Time-To-First-Fixed Attitude (TTFFA) statistics for the DCM. The flight tests have demonstrated high robustness of the PolaRx2@ in real-life high-dynamic environment. The test with a car and a trailer shows how the DCM algorithm can be used to obtain information on the deformations of flexible vehicles.","citedby-count":"21","prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13410023300","authid":"13410023300","authname":"Vander Kuylen L.","surname":"Vander Kuylen","given-name":"Leen","initials":"L."},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15623027000","authid":"15623027000","authname":"Boon F.","surname":"Boon","given-name":"Frank","initials":"F."},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13410778900","authid":"13410778900","authname":"Simsky A.","surname":"Simsky","given-name":"Andrew","initials":"A."}],"source-id":"4400151738","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/30844465476"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/30844465476?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=30844465476&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=30844465476&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/30844465476","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:30844465476","eid":"2-s2.0-30844465476","dc:title":"Coherent image processing using quaternion wavelets","dc:creator":"Chan W.L.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","prism:issn":"0277786X","prism:volume":"5914","prism:pageRange":"1-10","prism:coverDate":"2005-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2005","prism:doi":"10.1117/12.615393","dc:description":"We develop a quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) as a new multiscale analysis tool for geometric image features.

The performance of this algorithm is evaluated by an experimental optical head tracker system. This system is composed of infrared LEDs and two infrared CCD cameras, which are used to filter out the interference of another light in a limited environment like the cockpit. Then, the feature detection algorithm, used to obtain the 2D position coordinates of the features (infrared LED) on the image plane, is implemented by using the thresholding and the masking techniques. The state vector of the 3D motion and structure estimation algorithm consists of nine variables such as the positions, the velocities and the angular rates of the head frame with respect to the camera reference frame. The measurement model of the EKF is obtained from the perspective camera model and the 3D motion model. Based on the derived system and measurement models, the angular rate of the pilot's head is estimated by using the EKF since the rotation of the 3D motion model is expressed as the incremental rotation quaternion. To verify the experimental optical head tracker system, we used the rate table to compare the rotational performance of this tracker system with the inertial sensor.

Many face recognition algorithms have been proposed, among the different approaches, frequency domain methods, like advanced correlation filters have been shown to exhibit better tolerance to illumination variations than traditional methods. In this paper, we propose a new frequency domain face recognition method which combines the Gabor transforms and a quaternion correlation filter for face recognition when the illumination conditions are changed. The Gabor transform provides optimally localized spatial and frequency domain representation of the original face images, and the quaternion correlation filters can jointly process multi-channel subbands for more robust face recognition. The numerical experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the previously compared advanced correlation filter methods.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027950","afid":"60027950","affilname":"Carnegie Mellon University","affiliation-city":"Pittsburgh","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401934574","authid":"7401934574","authname":"Xie C.","surname":"Xie","given-name":"Chunyan","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027950"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603557177","authid":"6603557177","authname":"Savvides M.","surname":"Savvides","given-name":"Marios","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027950"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57053595000","authid":"57053595000","authname":"Kumar B.","surname":"Kumar","given-name":"B.

However, the automatic approach to 3D free form shape matching still remains open. In this paper, we propose using k closest points in the second view for the automatic 3D free form shape matching. For the sake of computational efficiency, the optimised k-D tree is employed for the search of the k closest points. Since occlusion and appearance and disappearance of points almost always occur, slack variables have to be employed, explicitly modelling outliers in the process of matching. Then the relative quality of each possible point match is estimated using the graduated assignment algorithm, leading the camera motion parameters to be estimated by the quaternion method in the weighted least-squares sense. The experimental results based on both synthetic data and real images without any pre-processing show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm for the automatic matching of overlapping 3D free form shapes with either sparse or dense points. © 2005 Pattern Recognition Society.

Whole-body PET and CT acquired on separate scanners are misregistered because of differences in patient positions and orientations, couch shapes, and breathing protocols. Although a combined PET/CT scanner removes many of these misalignments, breathing-related nonrigid mismatches still persist. Methods: We have developed a new, fully automated normalized mutual information-based 3-dimensional elastic image registration technique that can accurately align whole-body PET and CT images acquired on stand-alone scanners as well as a combined PET/CT scanner. The algorithm morphs the PET image to align spatially with the CT image by generating an elastic transformation field by interpolating quaternions and translations from multiple 6-parameter rigid-body registrations, each obtained for hierarchically subdivided image subvolumes. Fifteen whole-body (spanning thorax and abdomen) PET/CT image pairs acquired separately and 5 image pairs acquired on a combined scanner were registered. The cases were selected on the basis of the availability of both CT and PET images, without any other screening criteria, such as a specific clinical condition or prognosis. A rigorous quantitative validation was performed by evaluating algorithm performance in the context of variability among 3 clinical experts in the identification of up to 32 homologous anatomic landmarks. Results: The average execution time was 75 and 45 min for images acquired using separate scanners and combined scanner, respectively. Visual inspection indicated improved matching of homologous structures in all cases. The mean registration accuracy (5.5 and 5.9 mm for images from separate scanners and combined scanner, respectively) was found comparable to the mean interexpert difference in landmark identification (5.6 ± 2.4 and 6.6 ± 3.4 mm, respectively). The variability in landmark identification did not show statistically significant changes on replacing any expert by the algorithm. Conclusion: We have presented a new and automated elastic registration algorithm to correct for nonrigid misalignments in whole-body PET/CT images as well as improve the \"mechanical\" registration of a combined PET/CT scanner. The algorithm performance was on par with the average opinion of 3 experts.","citedby-count":"96","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021160","afid":"60021160","affilname":"Cleveland Clinic Foundation","affiliation-city":"Cleveland","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021157","afid":"60021157","affilname":"Lahey Hospital &amp; Medical Center","affiliation-city":"Burlington","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014653","afid":"60014653","affilname":"University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB)","affiliation-city":"Baltimore","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012957","afid":"60012957","affilname":"University of Maryland School of Medicine","affiliation-city":"Baltimore","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003500","afid":"60003500","affilname":"The Ohio State University","affiliation-city":"Columbus","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100430084","afid":"100430084","affilname":"Medina General Hospital","affiliation-city":null,"affiliation-country":"United States"}],"pubmed-id":"16157532","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004430328","authid":"7004430328","authname":"Shekhar R.","surname":"Shekhar","given-name":"Raj","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014653"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012957"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6508151608","authid":"6508151608","authname":"Walimbe V.","surname":"Walimbe","given-name":"Vivek","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021160"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003500"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7103346887","authid":"7103346887","authname":"Raja S.","surname":"Raja","given-name":"Shanker","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021157"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603164332","authid":"6603164332","authname":"Zagrodsky V.","surname":"Zagrodsky","given-name":"Vladimir","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021160"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603714499","authid":"6603714499","authname":"Kanvinde M.","surname":"Kanvinde","given-name":"Mangesh","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"100430084"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14071967400","authid":"14071967400","authname":"Wu G.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Guiyun","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021160"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602073026","authid":"6602073026","authname":"Bybel B.","surname":"Bybel","given-name":"Bohdan","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021160"}]}],"authkeywords":"Elastic registration | Image fusion | Image registration | Multimodality | Whole-body PET/CT","source-id":"17230","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/23844463863"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/23844463863?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=23844463863&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=23844463863&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/23844463863","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:23844463863","eid":"2-s2.0-23844463863","dc:title":"Spacecraft attitude estimation from vector observations using a fast particle filter","dc:creator":"Oshman Y.","prism:publicationName":"Advances in the Astronautical Sciences","prism:issn":"00653438","prism:volume":"119","prism:issueIdentifier":"SUPPL.","prism:pageRange":"593-607","prism:coverDate":"2005-08-26","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2005","dc:description":"A new algorithm is presented for the estimation of spacecraft attitude from vector observations. Belonging to the class of Monte Carlo sequential methods, the new estimator is a particle filter that uses approximate numerical representation techniques for performing the otherwise exact time propagation and measurement update of potentially non-Gaussian probability density functions in inherently nonlinear systems. The spacecraft attitude is represented via the quaternion of rotation. A genetic algorithm is used to estimate the gyro biases, allowing to estimate just the quaternion via the particle filter. This renders the new estimator highly efficient and enables its implementation with a remarkably small number of particles. Contrary to conventional filters, that have to address the quaternion's unit norm constraint via special (mostly ad hoc) techniques, the new filter maintains the quaternion's unit norm naturally, requiring no such modification. The results of a simulation study are presented, in which the new filter is compared to a conventional extended Kalman filter and to the recently proposed unscented Kalman filter in a case involving a low Earth orbit spacecraft, acquiring noisy Geomagnetic field measurements via a three axis magnetometer. The comparison demonstrates the viability of the new algorithm and its superior convergence rate relative to the alternatives.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022403","afid":"60022403","affilname":"Technion - Israel Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Haifa","affiliation-country":"Israel"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004302312","authid":"7004302312","authname":"Oshman Y.","surname":"Oshman","given-name":"Yaakov","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022403"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8703143200","authid":"8703143200","authname":"Carmi A.","surname":"Carmi","given-name":"Avishy","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022403"}]}],"source-id":"12376","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/23844512814"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/23844512814?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=23844512814&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=23844512814&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/23844512814","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:23844512814","eid":"2-s2.0-23844512814","dc:title":"Unbiased rigid registration using transfer functions","dc:creator":"Hahn D.A.","prism:publicationName":"Progress in Biomedical Optics and Imaging - Proceedings of SPIE","prism:issn":"16057422","prism:volume":"5747","prism:issueIdentifier":"I","prism:pageRange":"151-162","prism:coverDate":"2005-08-25","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2005","prism:doi":"10.1117/12.594577","dc:description":"The evaluation of tumor growth as regression under therapy is an important clinical issue. Rigid registration of sequentially acquired SD-images has proven its value for this purpose. Existing approaches to rigid image registration use the whole volume for the estimation of the rigid transform. Non-rigid soft tissue deformation, however, will imply a bias to the registration result, because local deformations cannot be modeled by rigid transforms. Anatomical substructures, like bones or teeth, are not affected by these deformations, but follow a rigid transform. This important observation is incorporated in the proposed registration algorithm. The selection of anatomical substructure is done by manual interaction of medical experts adjusting the transfer function of the volume rendering software. The parameters of the transfer function are used to identify the voxels that are considered for registration. A rigid transform is estimated by a quaternion gradient descent algorithm based on the intensity values of the specified tissue classes. Commonly used voxel intensity measures are adjusted to the modified registration algorithm. The contribution describes the mathematical framework of the proposed registration method and its implementation in a commercial software package. The experimental evaluation includes the discussion of different similarity measures, the comparison of the proposed method to established rigid registration techniques and the evaluation of the efficiency of the new method. We conclude with the discussion of potential medical applications of the proposed registration algorithm.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000765","afid":"60000765","affilname":"Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg","affiliation-city":"Erlangen","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8670743500","authid":"8670743500","authname":"Hahn D.A.","surname":"Hahn","given-name":"Dieter A.","initials":"D.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000765"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603448080","authid":"6603448080","authname":"Hornegger J.","surname":"Hornegger","given-name":"Joachim","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000765"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006772252","authid":"7006772252","authname":"Bautz W.","surname":"Bautz","given-name":"W.","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000765"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006265976","authid":"7006265976","authname":"Kuwert T.","surname":"Kuwert","given-name":"T.","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000765"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005219854","authid":"7005219854","authname":"Römer W.","surname":"Römer","given-name":"W.","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000765"}]}],"authkeywords":"Gradient Descent | Mono-modal Registration | Optimization | Rigid Registration | Similarity Measure | Transfer Function | Unbiased Estimation | Voxel Intensity","article-number":"16","source-id":"130022","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/25444517751"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/25444517751?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=25444517751&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=25444517751&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/25444517751","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:25444517751","eid":"2-s2.0-25444517751","dc:title":"Wigner distributions and ambiguity functions of 2-D quaternionic and monogenic signals","dc:creator":"Hahn S.L.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","prism:issn":"1053587X","prism:volume":"53","prism:issueIdentifier":"8","prism:pageRange":"3111-3128","prism:coverDate":"2005-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"August 2005","prism:doi":"10.1109/TSP.2005.851134","dc:description":"The paper presents new notions of Wigner distributions and corresponding ambiguity functions defined by quaternionic Fourier transforms of correlation products of recently defined quaternionic and monogenic two-dimensional (2-D) signals.

However, only a few methods take advantage of color in face images, even though most cameras produce color images and color can be beneficial for face recognition. Among the proposed color face recognition methods, most treat the three color channels separately and apply some grayscale face recognition methods to each of the channels and combine the results. In this paper we propose the quaternion correlation filter technique for color face recognition that processes all color channels jointly. Quaternion numbers are the generalization of the complex numbers and can be considered as a number with a real part and three orthogonal imaginary parts. A color image (e.g., in RGB) may be represented using quaternion representation by encoding the three color components in the imaginary parts of the quaternion number. The quaternion correlation filter is extended from the standard correlation filter based on the recently developed concepts of quaternion Fourier transform (QFT), quaternion convolution (QCV), and quaternion correlation (QC). Face recognition is performed by cross-correlating (QC) an input face image with a designed filter. Numerical results show that quaternion correlation filters can improve the recognition performance over conventional face recognition methods. © 2005 SPIE and IS&T.","citedby-count":"17","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027950","afid":"60027950","affilname":"Carnegie Mellon University","affiliation-city":"Pittsburgh","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401934574","authid":"7401934574","authname":"Xie C.","surname":"Xie","given-name":"Chunyan","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027950"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35779178500","authid":"35779178500","authname":"Vijaya Kumar B.","surname":"Vijaya Kumar","given-name":"B.

The majority of publications in spectral techniques consider Fourier transform on Abelian groups. However, non-Abelian groups provide notable advantages in efficient implementations of spectral methods. Fourier Analysis on Finite Groups with Applications in Signal Processing and System Design examines aspects of Fourier analysis on finite non-Abelian groups and discusses different methods used to determine compact representations for discrete functions providing for their efficient realizations and related applications. Switching functions are included as an example of discrete functions in engineering practice. Additionally, consideration is given to the polynomial expressions and decision diagrams defined in terms of Fourier transform on finite non-Abelian groups. A solid foundation of this complex topic is provided by beginning with a review of signals and their mathematical models and Fourier analysis. Next, the book examines recent achievements and discoveries in: Matrix interpretation of the fast Fourier transform. Optimization of decision diagrams. Functional expressions on quaternion groups. Gibbs derivatives on finite groups. Linear systems on finite non-Abelian groups. Hilbert transform on finite groups. Among the highlights is an in-depth coverage of applications of abstract harmonic analysis on finite non-Abelian groups in compact representations of discrete functions and related tasks in signal processing and system design, including logic design. All chapters are self-contained, each with a list of references to facilitate the development of specialized courses or self-study. With nearly 100 illustrative figures and fifty tables, this is an excellent textbook for graduate-level students and researchers in signal processing, logic design, and system theory-as well as the more general topics of computer science and applied mathematics. © 2005 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.
