In this paper we propose a method for automatic determination of missile position and orientation (pose) during target approach. The flight path is characterized by a forward motion, i.e. an approximately linear motion along the optical axis of the sensor system. Due to the lack of disparity, classical methods based on stereo triangulation are not suitable for 3D object recognition. To handle this we applied the SoftPOSIT algorithm, originally proposed by D. DeMenthon, and adapted it to fit our specific needs: The gathering of image points is done by multi-threshold segmentation, texture analysis, 2D tracking and edge detection. The reference points are updated in each loop and the calculated pose is smoothed using the quaternion representation of the model's orientation in order to stabilize the computations. We will show some results of image based determination of trajectories for airborne systems. Terminal homing is demonstrated by tracking the 3D pose of a vehicle in an image sequence taken in oblique view and gathered by an infrared sensor mounted to a helicopter.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/120147856","afid":"120147856","affilname":"GAN-FOM Forsch.

The attitude control system on the satellite is used to steer the satellite using commands from the groundstation and a television camera onboard the satellite will then downlink a television signal in real time to a monitor screen in the ground station. The operator in the feedback loop will be able to manually steer the boresight of the satellite's main imager towards interested target areas e.g. to avoid clouds or correct for any attitude pointing errors. Due to a substantial delay (in the order of a second) in the view finding feedback loop and the narrow field of view of the main imager, the operator has to be assisted by the onboard attitude control system to stabilise and track the target area visible on the monitor screen. This paper will present the extended Kalman filter used to estimate the satellite's attitude angles using quaternions and the bias vector component of the 3-axis inertial rate sensors (gyros). Absolute attitude sensors (i.e. sun, horizon and magnetic) are used to supply the measurement vectors to correct the filter states during the view finder manoeuvres. The target tracking and rate steering reaction wheel controllers to accurately point and stabilise the satellite will be presented. The reference generator for the satellite to target attitude and rate vectors as used by the reaction wheel controllers will be derived.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001565","afid":"60001565","affilname":"Stellenbosch University","affiliation-city":"Stellenbosch","affiliation-country":"South Africa"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100419988","afid":"100419988","affilname":"SunSpace Information Systems","affiliation-city":"Stellenbosch","affiliation-country":"South Africa"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701334364","authid":"6701334364","authname":"Steyn W.H.","surname":"Steyn","given-name":"W.

The quaternion magnitude-phase representation of the QWT directly leads to near shift-invariance and the ability to encode phase shifts in an absolute xy-coordinate system, which we can use for applications such as edge estimation and statistical image modeling. ©2004 IEEE.","citedby-count":"30","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005286","afid":"60005286","affilname":"Rice University","affiliation-city":"Houston","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403918942","authid":"7403918942","authname":"Chan W.L.","surname":"Chan","given-name":"Wai Lam","initials":"W.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005286"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404339360","authid":"7404339360","authname":"Choi H.","surname":"Choi","given-name":"Hyeokho","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005286"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35580714600","authid":"35580714600","authname":"Baraniuk R.","surname":"Baraniuk","given-name":"Richard","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005286"}]}],"source-id":"144684","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/20444440778"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/20444440778?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=20444440778&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=20444440778&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/20444440778","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:20444440778","eid":"2-s2.0-20444440778","dc:title":"2004 International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP) 2004 - Volume 2","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - International Conference on Image Processing, ICIP","prism:issn":"15224880","prism:volume":"2","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2004-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2004","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 176 papers from the 2004 International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP) 2004 - Volume 2.

In order to represent the probability density effectively, we propose the eigenpostures for the posture compression and use the kernel based Reduced Set Density Estimator (RSDE) for reduction of data samples. By applying the constructed human posture probability density for unprecedented posture detection and human motion segmentation, we verify its effectiveness for many kinds of application. © 2004 IEEE.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025272","afid":"60025272","affilname":"The University of Tokyo","affiliation-city":"Tokyo","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403055831","authid":"7403055831","authname":"Harada T.","surname":"Harada","given-name":"Tatsuya","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025272"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7407256263","authid":"7407256263","authname":"Mori T.","surname":"Mori","given-name":"Taketoshi","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025272"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55602042100","authid":"55602042100","authname":"Sato T.","surname":"Sato","given-name":"Tomomasa","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025272"}]}],"authkeywords":"Human motion | Motion capture | Motion database | Motion observation | Motion segmentation","source-id":"145097","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/15044340913"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/15044340913?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=15044340913&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=15044340913&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/15044340913","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:15044340913","eid":"2-s2.0-15044340913","dc:title":"Rotational-stereo-based vision system for 3-D measurement of silicon-mold of polymer microfluidic chips","dc:creator":"Liu S.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Information and Computational Science","prism:issn":"15487741","prism:volume":"1","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"169-173","prism:coverDate":"2004-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2004","dc:description":"A novel rotational-stereo-based micro measurement system (RSMMS) has been developed for 3-D measurement of silicon-mold used for reproduction of polymer microfluidic chips.

Some simulations illustrated the prospect of using hypercomplex signal in estimating parameters of two dimensional harmonics in additive Gaussian white noise without pairing steps.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007711","afid":"60007711","affilname":"Jilin University","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57199198662","authid":"57199198662","authname":"Wang F.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Fei","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16553752800","authid":"16553752800","authname":"Wang S.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Shuxun","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55525386500","authid":"55525386500","authname":"Wu Y.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Yonggui","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]}],"authkeywords":"Harmonics retrieval | Hypercomplex | Quaternion | Two dimensional","source-id":"120046","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/4644251135"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/4644251135?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=4644251135&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=4644251135&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S002186930400403X"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/4644251135","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:4644251135","eid":"2-s2.0-4644251135","dc:title":"The arithmetic of QM-abelian surfaces through their Galois representations","dc:creator":"Dieulefait L.V.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Algebra","prism:issn":"00218693","prism:volume":"281","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"124-143","prism:coverDate":"2004-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 November 2004","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jalgebra.2004.07.019","pii":"S002186930400403X","dc:description":"This note provides an insight to the diophantine properties of abelian surfaces with quaternionic multiplication over number fields.

In these studies, the left and right hippocampi are aligned independently and the spatial relation between them is not explored. This paper presents a new SPHARM-based technique which examines not only the individual shape information of the two hippocampi but also the spatial relation between them. The left and right hippocampi are treated as a single shape configuration. A ploy-shape alignment algorithm is developed for aligning configurations of multiple SPHARM surfaces as follows: (1) the total volume is normalized; (2) the parameter space is aligned for creating the surface correspondence; (3) landmarks are created by a uniform sampling of multiple surfaces for each configuration; (4) a quaternion-based algorithm is employed to align each landmark representation to the mean configuration through the least square rotation and translation iteratively until the mean converges. After applying the poly-shape alignment algorithm, a point distribution model is applied to aligned landmarks for feature extraction. Classification is performed using Fisher's linear discriminant with an effective feature selection scheme. Applying the above procedure to our hippocampal data (14 controls versus 25 schizophrenics, all right-handed males), we achieve the best cross-validation accuracy of 92%, supporting the idea that the whole shape configuration of the two hippocampi provides valuable information in detecting schizophrenia. The results of an ROC analysis and a visualization of discriminative patterns are also included.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010756","afid":"60010756","affilname":"Dartmouth College","affiliation-city":"Hanover","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007267","afid":"60007267","affilname":"Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth","affiliation-city":"Hanover","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35390032700","authid":"35390032700","authname":"Shen L.","surname":"Shen","given-name":"Li","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010756"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003437865","authid":"7003437865","authname":"Makedon F.","surname":"Makedon","given-name":"Fillia","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010756"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006442842","authid":"7006442842","authname":"Saykin A.","surname":"Saykin","given-name":"Andrew","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007267"}]}],"authkeywords":"Classification | Hippocampus | MRI | Shape alignment | Shape analysis | Surface modeling","source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/5644229954"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/5644229954?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=5644229954&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=5644229954&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/5644229954","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:5644229954","eid":"2-s2.0-5644229954","dc:title":"Elastic registration of three-dimensional whole body CT and PET images by quaternion-based interpolation of multiple piecewise linear rigid-body registrations","dc:creator":"Walimbe V.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","prism:issn":"0277786X","prism:volume":"5370 I","prism:pageRange":"119-128","prism:coverDate":"2004-10-27","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2004","prism:doi":"10.1117/12.535501","dc:description":"We report an algorithm for automatic elastic registration of whole body computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) images, which would allow accurate localization of viable tumors visible clearly in the perfusion PET image with respect to the anatomy that is better delineated in the CT image.

Some simulations illustrated the prospect of using hypercomplex signal in estimating parameters of two dimensional harmonics without pairing steps.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007711","afid":"60007711","affilname":"Jilin University","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56245312500","authid":"56245312500","authname":"Wang F.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Fei","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16553752800","authid":"16553752800","authname":"Wang S.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Shuxun","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005674629","authid":"7005674629","authname":"Dou H.","surname":"Dou","given-name":"Huijing","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57196156664","authid":"57196156664","authname":"Li J.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Jing","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]}],"source-id":"110544","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/8344284251"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/8344284251?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=8344284251&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=8344284251&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/8344284251","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:8344284251","eid":"2-s2.0-8344284251","dc:title":"A global quality measurement of pan-sharpened multispectral imagery","dc:creator":"Alparone L.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","prism:issn":"1545598X","prism:volume":"1","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"313-317","prism:coverDate":"2004-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"October 2004","prism:doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2004.836784","dc:description":"This letter focuses on quality assessment of fusion of multispectral (MS) images with high-resolution panchromatic (Pan) observations. A new quality index suitable for MS imagery having four spectral bands is defined from the theory of hyper-complex numbers, or quaternions. Both spectral and radiometric distortion measurements are encapsulated in a unique measurement, simultaneously accounting for local mean bias, changes in contrast, and loss of correlation of individual bands, together with spectral distortion.

Photogrammetry can be used to recover the large-scale features but has difficulty in modelling sufficient detail. Laser scanning on the other hand produces highly detailed depth data but is difficult to turn into a globally consistent model. We present a hybrid system for the creation of photorealistic and geometrically efficient and accurate models through the integration of photogrammetric modelling techniques with laser acquired range data. Our Hybrid Rendering software builds on the foundation of the Facade photogrammetric modelling system, but improves the degree of complexity of this representation by incorporating range data for those parts of the scene that are unmodelled. The salient planar features in the scan are extracted and used to align the models via a two-stage quaternion-based and ICP-based registration. The process allows for straightforward integration of multiple range scans. Rendering of novel views is achieved using view-dependent texture mapping techniques combined with point-based rendering.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027272","afid":"60027272","affilname":"The University of Edinburgh","affiliation-city":"Edinburgh","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603956267","authid":"6603956267","authname":"Lamond B.","surname":"Lamond","given-name":"Bruce","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027272"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401433736","authid":"7401433736","authname":"Watson G.","surname":"Watson","given-name":"Gordon","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027272"}]}],"source-id":"90060","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/4544366570"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/4544366570?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=4544366570&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=4544366570&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/4544366570","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:4544366570","eid":"2-s2.0-4544366570","dc:title":"Directional hypercomplex wavelets for multidimensional signal analysis and processing","dc:creator":"Chan W.L.","prism:publicationName":"ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - Proceedings","prism:issn":"15206149","prism:volume":"3","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2004-09-28","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2004","dc:description":"We extend the wavelet transform to handle multidimensional signals that are smooth save for singularities along lower-dimensional manifolds.

The HWT can be computed efficiently using a 1-D dual-tree complex wavelet transform along each signal axis. We demonstrate how the HWT can be used for fast line detection in 3-D.","citedby-count":"36","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005286","afid":"60005286","affilname":"Rice University","affiliation-city":"Houston","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403918942","authid":"7403918942","authname":"Chan W.L.","surname":"Chan","given-name":"Wai Lam","initials":"W.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005286"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404339360","authid":"7404339360","authname":"Choi H.","surname":"Choi","given-name":"Hyeokho","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005286"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35580714600","authid":"35580714600","authname":"Baraniuk R.G.","surname":"Baraniuk","given-name":"Richard G.","initials":"R.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005286"}]}],"source-id":"110544","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/69349106585"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/69349106585?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=69349106585&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=69349106585&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/69349106585","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:69349106585","eid":"2-s2.0-69349106585","dc:title":"The proceedings of the international computer congress 2004 on wavelet analysis and its applications, and active media technology: Volume 1","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the International Computer Congress 2004 on Wavelet Analysis and its Applications, and Active Media Technology","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"981238961X"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789812389619"}],"prism:volume":"1","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2004-09-13","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2004","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 82 papers from the conference of the International Computer Congress 2004 on wavelet analysis and its application and active media technology: volume 1.
