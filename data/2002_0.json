An interesting type of probe stimulus is one that is designed to be null with respect to the responses of known classes of cortical neurons. If such a stimulus is visible, the perceptual processing must be carried by undiscovered types of neural processing. Methods. The classic Necker cube may be generated in the novel form of a null-contrast image, gray bars against a background of high-contrast random texture of the same mean luminance as the bars. Regions of zero contrast produce no response in all known cortical neurons, so the brain has no obvious mechanism to identify the gray regions in the image. In particular, there is no signal to be integrated along the length of the bars and support their unification into a perceptual whole. Plausible computational models of simple, complex and hypercomplex neurons were developed on the basis of established neural models. Simulations revealed that none of the neuronal types responded coherently to the presence of the gray bars, being activated only bythe noise background. Results. Statistical evaluation of the simulated responses revealed no trace of the gray bars that could be detected by any signal operator (such as a peak detector) because the 'bars' only exist as an increased number of zeros among the background signals. Nevertheless, perceptual observation of the null-contrast stimulus revealed that it was subject to the well-known depth reversals of the standard Necker cube. These observations imply not only perceptual integration into a unitary figure, but one that can be interpreted three-dimensionally. Conclusion. This new class of null stimuli therefore represents a challenge for visual neuroscience, to explain the observed spatial integration of regions of no neural signal into coherent line structures supporting 3D percepts.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020968","afid":"60020968","affilname":"Smith Kettlewell Eye Research Institute","affiliation-city":"San Francisco","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203254553","authid":"57203254553","authname":"Tyler C.","surname":"Tyler","given-name":"Christopher W.","initials":"C.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020968"}]}],"source-id":"14509","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33751585460"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33751585460?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33751585460&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33751585460&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33751585460","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:33751585460","eid":"2-s2.0-33751585460","dc:title":"Geometric approach for pose detection of moving human heads","dc:creator":"Bayro-Corrochano E.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - International Conference on Pattern Recognition","prism:issn":"10514651","prism:volume":"16","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"636-639","prism:coverDate":"2002-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2002","dc:description":"This paper presents the detection of 3D pose of moving humans heads.

These units, which employ a 1553B interface to output their attitude quaternions and uncertainty at a 2 Hz rate, provide a 1 σ accuracy of better than 0.18, 0.18, and 5.1 arcsec about their X, Y, and Z axes, respectively. This is a factor 5.5 better than the accuracy of the flight-proven AST-201 from which the trackers were derived. To obtain this improvement, the field of view (FOV) was reduced to 5 by 5 degrees, the accurate Tycho-1 and ACT catalogs were used for selecting the 71,830 guide stars, star image centroiding was improved to better than 1/50th of a pixel, and optimal attitude estimation was implemented. In addition, the apparent direction to each guide star in the FOV is compensated for proper motion, parallax, velocity aberration, and optical distortion. The AST-301 employs autonomous time-delayed integration (TDI) to achieve image motion compensation (IMC) about its X axis that prevents accuracy degradation, even at rates of 2.1 deg/s, making it actually suitable for use on spinning spacecraft. About the Y axis, a software function called \"image motion accommodation\" (IMA) processes smeared images to maximize the signal to noise ratio of the resulting synthetic images, which enables robust and accurate tracking at rates tested up to 0.42 deg/s. The AST-301 is capable of acquiring its attitude anywhere in the sky in less than 3 seconds with a 99.98% probability of success, without requiring any a priori attitude knowledge. Following a description of the 7.1 kg AST-301, its operation and IMA, the methodology for translating the night sky test data into performance numbers is presented, while, in addition, the results of tests used to measure alignment stability over temperature are included.","citedby-count":"42","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002959","afid":"60002959","affilname":"Lockheed Martin Corporation","affiliation-city":"Bethesda","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55968204000","authid":"55968204000","authname":"Van Bezooijen R.","surname":"Van Bezooijen","given-name":"Roelof W.H.","initials":"R.W.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002959"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude determination | Autonomy | Image motion compensation | Smart sensor | Spinning spacecraft | Star identification | Star tracker","source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0036970467"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0036970467?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0036970467&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0036970467&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0036970467","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0036970467","eid":"2-s2.0-0036970467","dc:title":"An algebraic description of orthogonal designs and the uniqueness of the Alamouti code","dc:creator":"Sethuraman B.A.","prism:publicationName":"Conference Record / IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","prism:volume":"2","prism:pageRange":"1088-1092","prism:coverDate":"2002-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2002","dc:description":"An n × l (l ≥ n) space time block code (STBC) C consists of a finite number |C| of n × l matrices with entries from the complex field. If the entries of the codeword matrices are from a complex signal set S or complex linear combinations of elements of S then the code is said to be over S. For quasi-static, flat fading channels a primary performance index of C is the minimum of the rank of the difference of any two codeword matrices, called the rank of the code. C is of full-rank if its rank is n and is of minimal-delay if l = n. The rate of the code R in symbols per channel use is given by 1/l log|S|(|C|). It is well known that Orthogonal Designs provide rate 1, mimial-delay, full-rank STBCs with linear decodability, but exist only for n = 2 (Alamouti code) for complex constellations and for n = 2, 4 and 8 only for real constellations. In this paper, we present some general techniques for constructing rate 1, full-rank, minimal-delay STBCs over S using non-commutative division algebras of the rational field ℚ embedded in matrix rings. Using two ways of embedding non-commutative division algebras Into matrices, namely, the left regular representation and representation over maximal cyclic subfields, we observe that (i) the Alamouti's code and real orthogonal designs for n = 2 and 4 are just special cases of our construction and (ii) algebraically, the uniqueness of the Alamouti code is due to the fact: Hamilton's quaternions ℍ is the only non-commutative division algebra which has ℂ as a maximal subfield.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014097","afid":"60014097","affilname":"Indian Institute of Science","affiliation-city":"Bengaluru","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100385347","afid":"100385347","affilname":"AU-KBC Research Centre","affiliation-city":"Chennai","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603353204","authid":"6603353204","authname":"Sethuraman B.A.","surname":"Sethuraman","given-name":"B.

The attitude tumbling of the gyrostat satellite is suppressed with the proposed linear regulators. The numerical techniques for the generation of angular velocities of the gyrostat satellite and the determination of the attitude are investigated. As comparison, we formulated the process and observation models for the Kalman filtering algorithms. The simulation results indicate that QUEST algorithms can be employed to estimate the attitude of the gyrostat satellite point-by-point accurately, when combined with the GPS phase difference signals. The simulation also shows that the results from QUEST algorithms are of the same amplitude in accuracies as the results from the Kalman filtering algorithms. Under the appropriate assumption of measurement noises at the GPS phase difference signal, the precision of the attitude estimates is assessed to be at the level of 0.5° for the attitude motions of the gyrostat satellite. The results from the theoretical simulation in this paper can be used to validate the algorithms of the integer offset time biases and the assumption of line-of-sight measurement noises and the baseline-calibration. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This paper presents a wavelet-based algorithm for smoothing noise-embedded motion data and the experiment shows the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","citedby-count":"13","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014982","afid":"60014982","affilname":"National Cheng Kung University","affiliation-city":"Tainan","affiliation-country":"Taiwan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401724192","authid":"7401724192","authname":"Hsieh C.","surname":"Hsieh","given-name":"Chung Chi","initials":"C.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014982"}]}],"authkeywords":"Motion fairing | Unit quaternions | Virtual reality | Wavelets","source-id":"24360","fund-acr":"NSC","fund-no":"-88-2213-E-006-114","fund-sponsor":"National Science Council","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0036807033"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0036807033?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0036807033&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0036807033&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0036807033","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0036807033","eid":"2-s2.0-0036807033","dc:title":"Constrained filtering method for attitude determination using GPS and gyro","dc:creator":"Chiang Y.T.","prism:publicationName":"IEE Proceedings: Radar, Sonar and Navigation","prism:issn":"13502395","prism:volume":"149","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"258-264","prism:coverDate":"2002-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"October 2002","prism:doi":"10.1049/ip-rsn:20020531","dc:description":"In attitude determination using the unit quaternion representation, the unit norm constraint results in singularity of the covariance matrix using classical filtering methods. To cope with this problem, a constrained filtering method is developed.

The basics of GPS attitude determination are described, and two attitude determination algorithms are described and compared: one based on least squares estimation, and the other based on Kalman Filtering. The algorithm developed for resolving integer ambiguities in the carrier phase differences is tested to achieve instantaneous attitude from a set of only four measurements collected from two antenna baselines. A quaternion estimator based on a standard extended Kalman filter (qEKF) uses all GPS measurements to enable continued attitude determination taking into account the spacecraft dynamics. The attitude information derived from on-board magnetometers and a horizon sensor is used to evaluate the results of GPS attitude determination. Most recently, the LSQ attitude algorithms have been demonstrated in orbit and compared with the qEKF method. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.","citedby-count":"22","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021097","afid":"60021097","affilname":"University of Surrey","affiliation-city":"Guildford","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57223693321","authid":"57223693321","authname":"Unwin M.","surname":"Unwin","given-name":"Martin","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021097"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6504692929","authid":"6504692929","authname":"Da Silva Curiel P.P.A.","surname":"Da Silva Curiel","given-name":"P.

A special symplectic manifold is then defined as a special complex manifold together with a ∇ - parallel symplectic form ω. This generalises Freed's definition of (affine) special Kähler manifolds. We also define projective versions of all these geometries. Our main result is an extrinsic realisation of all simply connected (affine or projective) special complex, symplectic and Kähler manifolds. We prove that the above three types of special geometry are completely solvable, in the sense that they are locally defined by free holomorphic data. In fact, any special complex manifold is locally realised as the image of a holomorphic one-forms α: ℂn → T*ℂn. Such a realisation induces a canonical ∇ - parallel symplectic structure on M and any special symplectic manifold is locally obtained this way. Special Kähler manifolds are realised as complex Lagrangian submanifolds and correspond to closed forms α. Finally, we discuss the natural geometric structures on the cotangent bundle of a special symplectic manifold, which generalise the hyper-Kähler structure on the cotangent bundle of a special Kähler manifold. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The approach is based on quaternion algebra and convolution.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001359","afid":"60001359","affilname":"University of Essex","affiliation-city":"Colchester","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003346836","authid":"7003346836","authname":"Sangwine S.J.","surname":"Sangwine","given-name":"Stephen J.","initials":"S.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001359"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6504158203","authid":"6504158203","authname":"Gatsheni B.N.","surname":"Gatsheni","given-name":"Barnabas N.","initials":"B.N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001359"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603651371","authid":"6603651371","authname":"Ell T.A.","surname":"Ell","given-name":"Todd A.","initials":"T.A."}],"article-number":"7072153","source-id":"21100204301","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960846415"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960846415?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84960846415&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84960846415&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960846415","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84960846415","eid":"2-s2.0-84960846415","dc:title":"Hypercomplex operators and vector correlation","dc:creator":"Moxey C.","prism:publicationName":"European Signal Processing Conference","prism:issn":"22195491","prism:volume":"2002-March","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2002-03-27","prism:coverDisplayDate":"27 March 2002","dc:description":"Auto-, cross- and phase-correlation are standard techniques in image and signal processing.

The full-sky scan strategy requires MAP to spin at 2.7 deg/s which necessitated the use of autonomous time delayed integration (TDI) image motion compensation (IMC) for the two redundant AST-201 autonomous star trackers used as primary attitude sensors. In addition to providing high accuracy at rotation rates ranging from -3 to +3 deg/s, the trackers are also capable of rapid and reliable attitude acquisition anywhere in the sky without a need for a priori attitude or rate information. Following a description of the MAP ASTs, their operation, and TDI IMC, \"night sky\" test results are presented. During flight, the velocity aberration compensated AST attitude quaternions were used to compute the attitude of AST B relative to AST A during four periods in an eighth month time interval. This resulted in irrefutable proof that the RSS of the attitude errors of the two trackers, which are pointing in opposite directions, amounts to only 1.43, 1.32, and 20.8 arcsec about their X, Y, and Z axes (1 σ), with roughly equal contributions from each tracker. The attitude uncertainty estimated by each AST was found to be within 10% of the actual error. This verification allows us to conclude that the accuracy of the other eight ASTs launched so far, including the ones for IMAGE and EO-1, is excellent as well. © 2002 by the author(s).

This is a challenging problem because of the large variability in both background clutter and object appearance. Bülow and Sommer use hypercomplex numbers to obtain local phase information, which reveals the intrinsic dimensionality of the signal. The three local phase components are indicative of the local texture within an image. We use these texture components to identify anomalies on the sea floor. First we generate the quaternion signal of real 2D input using Hubert transforms (a 2D equivalent of the complex signal of real ID input). Three phase angles and a magnitude are obtained from this quaternion. The magnitude is the square root of the sum of the squares of the quaternion coefficients. The first phase angle, theta, is equivalent to the linear phase in the x-direction. The second phase angle, phi, is equivalent to the linear phase in the y-direction. The third phase angle, psi, is related to the two-dimensional texture. A very random texture produces random values for the phases. An anomaly in a given texture region maps to related values in the phase components in that region. We explore the effectiveness of this approach to texture anomaly detection with real data. Anomalous textures, such as man-made objects in images of the sea floor, appear as spatially predictable regions of extreme values in the phase components. We have shown that the phase components are of some value in identifying regions of a sonar image that contain unusual texture when compared to the rest of the image. This method could be used in a real system as a practical human decision support, identifying regions of interest (detections) in images where simple thresholding is ineffective.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60082939","afid":"60082939","affilname":"Naval Coastal Systems Center, Florida","affiliation-city":"Panama City","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12766591200","authid":"12766591200","authname":"Redfield S.A.","surname":"Redfield","given-name":"S.

Primary tests show that the static accuracy of the system is +/-0.2 degree for pitch and roll, and +/-0.3 degree for azimuth.","citedby-count":"25","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025278","afid":"60025278","affilname":"Tsinghua University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402833441","authid":"7402833441","authname":"Gao Z.","surname":"Gao","given-name":"Zhong Yu","initials":"Z.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025278"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55159995300","authid":"55159995300","authname":"Niu X.","surname":"Niu","given-name":"Xiao Ji","initials":"X.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025278"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201564951","authid":"7201564951","authname":"Guo M.","surname":"Guo","given-name":"Mei Feng","initials":"M.F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025278"}]}],"authkeywords":"Kalman filter | Micro-machined inertial sensors | Quaternion algebra | Strapdown AHRS","source-id":"13831","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherhybridgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Hybrid Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0036863759"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0036863759?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0036863759&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0036863759&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0888327002914767"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0036863759","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0036863759","eid":"2-s2.0-0036863759","dc:title":"Pressure transmitter surveillance using quaternion numbers","dc:creator":"Chicharro J.M.","prism:publicationName":"Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing","prism:issn":"08883270","prism:volume":"16","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"1083-1091","prism:coverDate":"2002-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2002","prism:doi":"10.1006/mssp.2002.1476","pii":"S0888327002914767","dc:description":"Rosemount pressure transmitters are widely used in Nuclear Power Plants.

By decomposing a bicomplex multiplier into two parallel complex multipliers, we show that hypercomplex digital filters can be implemented as two parallel complex digital filters. The proposed implementation offers more than a 60% reduction in the count of real multipliers.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008150","afid":"60008150","affilname":"Kanagawa University","affiliation-city":"Yokohama","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"le","subtypeDescription":"Letter","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7103228306","authid":"7103228306","authname":"Toyoshima H.","surname":"Toyoshima","given-name":"Hisamichi","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008150"}]}],"source-id":"26076","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0036530163"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0036530163?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0036530163&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0036530163&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0036530163","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0036530163","eid":"2-s2.0-0036530163","dc:title":"General construction of time-domain filters for orientation data","dc:creator":"Lee J.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","prism:issn":"10772626","prism:volume":"8","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"119-128","prism:coverDate":"2002-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April/June 2002","prism:doi":"10.1109/2945.998665","dc:description":"Capturing live motion has gained considerable attention in computer animation as an important motion generation technique. Canned motion data are comprised of both position and orientation components. Although a great number of signal processing methods are available for manipulating position data, the majority of these methods cannot be generalized easily to orientation data due to the inherent nonlinearity of the orientation space. In this paper, we present a new scheme that enables us to apply a filter mask (or a convolution filter) to orientation data. The key idea is to transform the orientation data into their analogues in a vector space, to apply a filter mask on them, and then to transform the results back to the orientation space. This scheme gives time-domain filters for orientation data that are computationally efficient and satisfy such important properties as coordinate-invariance, time-invariance, and symmetry. Experimental results indicate that our scheme is useful for various purposes including smoothing and sharpening.","citedby-count":"93","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104841","afid":"60104841","affilname":"The Robotics Institute","affiliation-city":"Pittsburgh","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032144","afid":"60032144","affilname":"Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Daejeon","affiliation-country":"South Korea"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000251","afid":"60000251","affilname":"IEEE","affiliation-city":"New York","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55689897000","authid":"55689897000","authname":"Lee J.","surname":"Lee","given-name":"Jehee","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104841"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403646855","authid":"7403646855","authname":"Shin S.","surname":"Shin","given-name":"Sung Yong","initials":"S.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000251"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032144"}]}],"authkeywords":"Convolution filters | Coordinate-invariance | LTI filters | Motion signal processing | Orientation and rotation | Time-invariance | Unit quaternions","source-id":"25535","fund-acr":"NRL","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"U.S. Naval Research Laboratory","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0036447836"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0036447836?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0036447836&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0036447836&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0036447836","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0036447836","eid":"2-s2.0-0036447836","dc:title":"Color-grayscale image registration using hypercomplex phase correlation","dc:creator":"Moxey C.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","prism:volume":"2","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2002-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2002","dc:description":"Phase correlation has been used for the registration of gray-scale images for the past 25 years. A recently published hypercomplex generalization of phase correlation has been applied to the registration of vector, or color, images. This paper demonstrates phase-correlation between a grayscale and a color image using the two possibilities for encoding the grayscale image in a quaternion image format. By implementing both the scalar and vector forms of the grayscale image this paper compares, for the first time, vector-vector to scalar-vector hypercomplex correlation. While both are found to give a similar performance, for this application, the analysis of the hypercomplex response finds that the inherent geometry of the quaternionic encoding hides the underlying processing and the phase and axis information. The choice of which method to employ in such applications should therefore be considered with due respect to the encoding of the data in either case.","citedby-count":"26","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001359","afid":"60001359","affilname":"University of Essex","affiliation-city":"Colchester","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602511649","authid":"6602511649","authname":"Moxey C.","surname":"Moxey","given-name":"C.

Indeed, very often information about 3D objects can be obtained by computer tomographic reconstruction, 3D magnetic resonance imaging, passive 3D sensors or active range finders. Due to that algorithms of systematic derivation of 3D moment invariants should be developed for 3D colour object recognition. In this work we proposed an elegant theory which allows to describe many such invariants. Our theory is based on the theory of triplet numbers and quaternions. We propose Hurwitzon-valued invariants, which are related to the descriptions of objects as the zero sets of implicit polynomials. These are global invariants which show great promise for recognition of complicated objects. Hurwitzon-valued invariants have good discriminating power for computer recognition of 3D colour objects using statistical pattern recognition methods. For fast computation of Hurwitzon-valued invariants we use modular arithmetic of Galois fields and rings, which maps calculation of invariants to fast number theoretical Fourier-Galois-Hamilton-transform.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011170","afid":"60011170","affilname":"Tampere University","affiliation-city":"Tampere","affiliation-country":"Finland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7801669875","authid":"7801669875","authname":"Labounets V.","surname":"Labounets","given-name":"Valeri","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011170"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6507163290","authid":"6507163290","authname":"Labounets-Rundblad E.","surname":"Labounets-Rundblad","given-name":"Ekaterina","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011170"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35232592700","authid":"35232592700","authname":"Astola J.","surname":"Astola","given-name":"Jaakko","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011170"}]}],"source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
