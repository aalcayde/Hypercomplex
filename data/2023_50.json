Accordingly, the speech emotion recognition (SER) method plays a crucial role in creating the Metaverse platforms more usable​ and enjoyable for its users. However, existing SER methods continue to be plagued by two significant problems in the online environment. The shortage of adequate engagement and customization between avatars and users is recognized as the first issue and the second problem is related to the complexity of SER problems in the Metaverse as we face people and their digital twins or avatars. This is why developing efficient machine learning (ML) techniques specified for hypercomplex signal processing is essential to enhance the impressiveness and tangibility of the Metaverse platforms. As a solution, echo state networks (ESNs), which are an ML powerful tool for SER, can be an appropriate technique to enhance the Metaverse's foundations in this area. Nevertheless, ESNs have some technical issues restricting them from a precise and reliable analysis, especially in the aspect of high-dimensional data. The most significant limitation of these networks is the high memory consumption caused by their reservoir structure in face of high-dimensional signals. To solve all problems associated with ESNs and their application in the Metaverse, we have come up with a novel structure for ESNs empowered by octonion algebra called NO2GESNet. Octonion numbers have eight dimensions, compactly display high-dimensional data, and improve the network precision and performance in comparison to conventional ESNs. The proposed network also solves the weaknesses of the ESNs in the presentation of the higher-order statistics to the output layer by equipping it with a multidimensional bilinear filter. Three comprehensive scenarios to use the proposed network in the Metaverse have been designed and analyzed, not only do they show the accuracy and performance of the proposed approach, but also the ways how SER can be employed in the Metaverse platforms.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003263","afid":"60003263","affilname":"University of West Bohemia","affiliation-city":"Plzen","affiliation-country":"Czech Republic"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001619","afid":"60001619","affilname":"University of Kurdistan","affiliation-city":"Sanandaj","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"pubmed-id":"37030275","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35078447100","authid":"35078447100","orcid":"0000-0003-3150-3527","authname":"Daneshfar F.","surname":"Daneshfar","given-name":"Fatemeh","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001619"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57317975000","authid":"57317975000","authname":"Jamshidi M.(.","surname":"Jamshidi","given-name":"Mohammad (Behdad)","initials":"M.(.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003263"}]}],"authkeywords":"Digital twins | Echo state network | Machine learning | Metaverse | Octonion algebra | Speech emotion recognition","source-id":"24804","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85151550111"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85151550111?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85151550111&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85151550111&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1568494623002892"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85151550111","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85151550111","eid":"2-s2.0-85151550111","dc:title":"Robust color image watermarking algorithm based on synchronization correction with multi-layer perceptron and Cauchy distribution model","dc:creator":"Jiang M.r.","prism:publicationName":"Applied Soft Computing","prism:issn":"15684946","prism:volume":"140","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2023","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.asoc.2023.110271","pii":"S1568494623002892","dc:description":"A robust color image watermarking algorithm based on the multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and Cauchy distribution model is proposed. The algorithm has great performance against geometric attacks. Firstly, the central region of the Y-color channel is extracted, and the watermark is embedded into the low-frequency component by dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT). A synchronization correction technique based on the MLP model is used prior to the watermark extraction. When the MLP model is trained, the position and scale parameters of the Cauchy distribution are employed to generate the image feature vector after first calculating the quaternion discrete cosine transform (QDCT) of the original color host image. The new 3D hyperchaotic mapping is used during the algorithmic process to increase security, which is employed for scrambling, encryption, and embedding of watermarks, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has good imperceptibility, accurate model prediction, and excellent robustness against common image processing attacks and geometric attacks.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013268","afid":"60013268","affilname":"Taiyuan University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Taiyuan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011592","afid":"60011592","affilname":"Qilu University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Jinan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58130631900","authid":"58130631900","authname":"Jiang M.r.","surname":"Jiang","given-name":"Mei ru","initials":"M.r.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013268"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8051940600","authid":"8051940600","authname":"Feng X.f.","surname":"Feng","given-name":"Xiu fang","initials":"X.f.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013268"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55318994100","authid":"55318994100","authname":"Wang C.p.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Chun peng","initials":"C.p.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011592"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57428767900","authid":"57428767900","authname":"Fan X.l.","surname":"Fan","given-name":"Xiao le","initials":"X.l.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013268"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209296515","authid":"57209296515","authname":"Zhang H.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Hao","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013268"}]}],"authkeywords":"Cauchy distribution model | Color image watermarking | Dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) | Hyperchaotic mapping | Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) | Quaternion discrete cosine transform (QDCT)","article-number":"110271","source-id":"18136","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"202102020101007","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85150388552"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85150388552?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85150388552&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85150388552&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0273117723000923"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85150388552","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85150388552","eid":"2-s2.0-85150388552","dc:title":"Underactuated attitude tracking control of tethered spacecraft for deployment and spin-up","dc:creator":"Tian H.","prism:publicationName":"Advances in Space Research","prism:issn":"02731177","prism:eIssn":"18791948","prism:volume":"71","prism:issueIdentifier":"11","prism:pageRange":"4829-4842","prism:coverDate":"2023-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 June 2023","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.asr.2023.01.052","pii":"S0273117723000923","dc:description":"This paper investigates the underactuated attitude tracking control problem of tethered spacecraft during tether deploying and spinning. The attitudes are controlled by the torque inputs along two body axes and perturbed by the tether tension torque. The coupling effect between spacecraft attitudes and flexible tethers can be alleviated by simplifying control inputs. The main contribution is the development of an underactuated tracking controller with an adaptive barrier function that inhibits unknown disturbance. To avoid singularity problems with tether and spacecraft during simulation, the dynamic model of a tethered system is derived using quaternion transformations. The underactuated attitude control strategy is designed by kinematic state coupling relations and dynamic backstepping technique, which is given extensive stability demonstration using Lyapunov's theory. An adaptive controller gain with barrier function is employed to inhibit the bounded unknown disturbance with no need for the online estimation signal. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed underactuated strategy in the case of tether deployment and spin-up, respectively.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003977","afid":"60003977","affilname":"Northwestern Polytechnical University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201469385","authid":"57201469385","orcid":"0000-0002-6732-7732","authname":"Tian H.","surname":"Tian","given-name":"Haochang","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55751458600","authid":"55751458600","authname":"Li A.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Aijun","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56362845800","authid":"56362845800","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yu","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55684012600","authid":"55684012600","authname":"Wang C.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Changqing","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]}],"authkeywords":"Backstepping control | Barrier function | Tether deployment and spin-up | Tethered spacecraft system | Underactuated attitude control","source-id":"12375","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61803307","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85148997715"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85148997715?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85148997715&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85148997715&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85148997715","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85148997715","eid":"2-s2.0-85148997715","dc:title":"An IMU-Based Wearable System for Respiratory Rate Estimation in Static and Dynamic Conditions","dc:creator":"Angelucci A.","prism:publicationName":"Cardiovascular Engineering and Technology","prism:issn":"1869408X","prism:eIssn":"18694098","prism:volume":"14","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"351-363","prism:coverDate":"2023-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2023","prism:doi":"10.1007/s13239-023-00657-3","dc:description":"Purpose: Breathing parameters change with activity and posture, but currently available solutions can perform measurements only during static conditions. Methods: This article presents an innovative wearable sensor system constituted by three inertial measurement units to simultaneously estimate respiratory rate (RR) in static and dynamic conditions and perform human activity recognition (HAR) with the same sensing principle. Two units are aimed at detecting chest wall breathing-related movements (one on the thorax, one on the abdomen); the third is on the lower back. All units compute the quaternions describing the subject’s movement and send data continuously with the ANT transmission protocol to an app. The 20 healthy subjects involved in the research (9 men, 11 women) were between 23 and 54 years old, with mean age 26.8, mean height 172.5 cm and mean weight 66.9 kg. Data from these subjects during different postures or activities were collected and analyzed to extract RR. Results: Statistically significant differences between dynamic activities (“walking slow”, “walking fast”, “running” and “cycling”) and static postures were detected (p < 0.05), confirming the obtained measurements are in line with physiology even during dynamic activities. Data from the reference unit only and from all three units were used as inputs to artificial intelligence methods for HAR. When the data from the reference unit were used, the Gated Recurrent Unit was the best performing method (97% accuracy). With three units, a 1D Convolutional Neural Network was the best performing (99% accuracy). Conclusion: Overall, the proposed solution shows it is possible to perform simultaneous HAR and RR measurements in static and dynamic conditions with the same sensor system.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023256","afid":"60023256","affilname":"Politecnico di Milano","affiliation-city":"Milan","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"pubmed-id":"36849621","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57213192457","authid":"57213192457","orcid":"0000-0001-8266-9346","authname":"Angelucci A.","surname":"Angelucci","given-name":"Alessandra","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006361013","authid":"7006361013","authname":"Aliverti A.","surname":"Aliverti","given-name":"Andrea","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023256"}]}],"authkeywords":"e-Health | Human activity recognition | Internet of medical things | Respiratory monitoring | Telemedicine","source-id":"19600166325","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Politecnico di Milano","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherhybridgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Hybrid Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85147751134"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85147751134?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85147751134&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85147751134&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85147751134","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85147751134","eid":"2-s2.0-85147751134","dc:title":"Image super resolution via combination of two dimensional quaternion valued singular spectrum analysis based denoising, empirical mode decomposition based denoising and discrete cosine transform based denoising methods","dc:creator":"Cheng Y.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","prism:issn":"13807501","prism:eIssn":"15737721","prism:volume":"82","prism:issueIdentifier":"15","prism:pageRange":"22705-22722","prism:coverDate":"2023-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2023","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11042-023-14474-2","dc:description":"This paper formulates the image super resolution problem as various denoising problems. In particular, the discrete cosine transform zero padding approach is used to generate an initial high resolution image. Then, three different time frequency analysis based denoising methods are applied iteratively to improve the quality of the super resolution image. In particular, the two dimensional quaternion valued singular spectrum analysis (2DQSSA) based denoising method, the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based denoising method and the discrete cosine transform based denoised method are applied. For the 2DQSSA based denoising method, the luminance plane is used as the real part of the quaternion valued image. Since different color planes in the quaternion valued image are fused together via the quaternion valued operation, some high frequency information missing in one color plane can be generated using those in other color planes. On the other hand, for the EMD based denoising method, the selection of the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) is formulated as a binary linear programming problem. Here, the high frequency components generated by the aliasing are removed by discarding some IMFs. The computer numerical simulation results show that our proposed method can achieve the super resolution performance better than those without performing any one of the above three time frequency analysis based denoising.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008928","afid":"60008928","affilname":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007155","afid":"60007155","affilname":"Guangdong University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58096924400","authid":"58096924400","authname":"Cheng Y.","surname":"Cheng","given-name":"Yingdan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007155"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57210406493","authid":"57210406493","orcid":"0000-0002-0633-7224","authname":"Ling B.W.K.","surname":"Ling","given-name":"Bingo Wing Kuen","initials":"B.W.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007155"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57218477837","authid":"57218477837","authname":"Lin Y.","surname":"Lin","given-name":"Yuxin","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007155"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193615950","authid":"57193615950","authname":"Huang Z.","surname":"Huang","given-name":"Ziyin","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007155"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403675929","authid":"7403675929","authname":"Chan Y.L.","surname":"Chan","given-name":"Yui Lam","initials":"Y.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008928"}]}],"authkeywords":"Binary linear programming | Discrete cosine transform | Empirical mode decomposition | Super resolution image | Two dimensional quaternion valued singular spectrum analysis","source-id":"25627","fund-acr":"NSFC, NNSF, NNSFC","fund-no":"2017KCXTD011","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85147497494"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85147497494?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85147497494&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85147497494&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85147497494","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85147497494","eid":"2-s2.0-85147497494","dc:title":"Multiple μ-stability analysis of time-varying delayed quaternion-valued neural networks","dc:creator":"Chouhan S.S.","prism:publicationName":"Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences","prism:issn":"01704214","prism:eIssn":"10991476","prism:volume":"46","prism:issueIdentifier":"9","prism:pageRange":"9853-9875","prism:coverDate":"2023-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2023","prism:doi":"10.1002/mma.9089","dc:description":"This article addresses the multiple (Formula presented.) -stability analysis of (Formula presented.) -dimensional quaternion-valued neural networks (QVNNs) with unbounded time-varying delays (UTVD) and two general classes of activation functions (AFs).

The VA-INS is composed of a vision unit (monocular or stereo camera) and a typical low-cost 6-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) equipped with an accelerometer and a gyroscope. A major benefit of this approach is its applicability for environments where the Global Positioning System (GPS) is inaccessible. The proposed VTOL-UAV observer utilizes IMU and feature measurements to accurately estimate attitude (orientation), gyroscope bias, position, and linear velocity. Ability to use VA-INS measurements directly makes the proposed observer design more computationally efficient as it obviates the need for attitude and position reconstruction. Once the motion components are estimated, the observer-based controller is used to control the VTOL-UAV attitude, angular velocity, position, and linear velocity guiding the vehicle along the desired trajectory in six degrees of freedom (6 DoF). The closed-loop estimation and the control errors of the observer-based controller are proven to be exponentially stable starting from almost any initial condition. To achieve global and unique VTOL-UAV representation in 6 DoF, the proposed approach is posed on the Lie Group and the design in unit-quaternion is presented. Although the proposed approach is described in a continuous form, the discrete version is provided and tested.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027332","afid":"60027332","affilname":"Szegedi Tudományegyetem (SZTE)","affiliation-city":"Szeged","affiliation-country":"Hungary"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017592","afid":"60017592","affilname":"Carleton University","affiliation-city":"Ottawa","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008928","afid":"60008928","affilname":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"}],"pubmed-id":"36588058","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191054010","authid":"57191054010","orcid":"0000-0003-2376-0603","authname":"Hashim H.A.","surname":"Hashim","given-name":"Hashim A.","initials":"H.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017592"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194764750","authid":"57194764750","orcid":"0000-0001-5714-3641","authname":"Eltoukhy A.E.E.","surname":"Eltoukhy","given-name":"Abdelrahman E.E.","initials":"A.E.E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008928"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25930140500","authid":"25930140500","authname":"Odry A.","surname":"Odry","given-name":"Akos","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027332"}]}],"authkeywords":"Exponential stability | Landmark measurement | Observer-based controller algorithm | Unmanned Aerial Vehicle | Vertical Take-Off and Landing | Vision-Aided Inertial Navigation System","source-id":"29805","fund-acr":"NSERC","fund-no":"RGPIN-2022-04937","fund-sponsor":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85139865274"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85139865274?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85139865274&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85139865274&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85139865274","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85139865274","eid":"2-s2.0-85139865274","dc:title":"G-NET: Accurate Lane Detection Model for Autonomous Vehicle","dc:creator":"Wang H.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Systems Journal","prism:issn":"19328184","prism:eIssn":"19379234","prism:volume":"17","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"2039-2048","prism:coverDate":"2023-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 June 2023","prism:doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2022.3210209","dc:description":"Lane detection is an essential task in autonomous driving. A good lane detection model should achieve many objectives, such as high accuracy, rapid detection, and low memory. In this article, a grid-based network (G-NET) is designed to realize the aforementioned goals. In G-NET, the traditional pixel-level semantic segmentation is replaced with the area-level grid segmentation to release the detection burden. Then, a position vector is introduced to indicate where lane key point is in the grid. Meanwhile, the novel rolling convolution layer following with the down-sampling and up-sampling convolution layer has been designed for good feature extraction, ensuring each feature grid perceives all other grid features in the feature map. Then, an adaptive hyperparameter branch is introduced to calculate the binary threshold effectively. Finally, the detected lane points are classified into different lanes by introducing distance-based quaternion. G-NET is extensively evaluated on three most widely datasets: TuSimple, CULane, and CurveLanes. The results show that G-NET has a state-of-the-art performance.

As a rule, the fundamental vectors of the colour space are derived by inverting the three RGB colour directions in the complex hyperplanes. In the proposed system, colour is represented as a quaternion because quaternion algebra provides a very intuitive means of working with homogeneous coordinates. This representation views a colour pixel as a point in the three-dimensional space. A novel quantization approach that makes use of projective geometry and level set methods has been produced as a consequence of the suggested model. The JSEG colour texture segmentation will use this technique. The new colour quantization approach utilises the binary quaternion moment preserving thresholding methodology, and is therefore a splintering clustering method. This method is used to segment the colour clusters found inside the RGB cube and the colour consistency throughout the spectrum and in the space are both considered. The results of the segmentation are compared with JSEG as well as with the most recent standard segmentation techniques. These comparisons show that the suggested quantization technique makes JSEG segmentation more robust.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60076774","afid":"60076774","affilname":"Amity University","affiliation-city":"Noida","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/126606654","afid":"126606654","affilname":"Rajkiya Engineering College","affiliation-city":"Sonbhadra","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58484708800","authid":"58484708800","authname":"Tripathi B.","surname":"Tripathi","given-name":"Bharat","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60076774"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56957784100","authid":"56957784100","authname":"Srivastava N.","surname":"Srivastava","given-name":"Nidhi","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60076774"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36988120800","authid":"36988120800","authname":"Tiwari A.K.","surname":"Tiwari","given-name":"Amod Kumar","initials":"A.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"126606654"}]}],"authkeywords":"Image Quantization | Image Segmentation | JSEG | Quaternion","source-id":"21101089961","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85160399589"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85160399589?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85160399589&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85160399589&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85160399589","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85160399589","eid":"2-s2.0-85160399589","dc:title":"Generating Low-Earth Orbit Satellite Attitude Maneuver Profiles Using Deep Neural Networks","dc:creator":"Yun S.T.","prism:publicationName":"Sensors","prism:issn":"14248220","prism:volume":"23","prism:issueIdentifier":"10","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May 2023","prism:doi":"10.3390/s23104650","dc:description":"To perform Earth observations, low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites require attitude maneuvers, which can be classified into two types: maintenance of a target-pointing attitude and maneuvering between target-pointing attitudes. The former depends on the observation target, while the latter has nonlinear characteristics and must consider various conditions. Therefore, generating an optimal reference attitude profile is difficult. Mission performance and satellite antenna position-to-ground communication are also determined by the maneuver profile between the target-pointing attitudes. Generating a reference maneuver profile with small errors before target pointing can enhance the quality of the observation images and increase the maximum possible number of missions and accuracy of ground contact. Therefore, herein we proposed a technique for optimizing the maneuver profile between target-pointing attitudes based on data-based learning. We used a deep neural network based on bidirectional long short-term memory to model the quaternion profiles of LEO satellites. This model was used to predict the maneuvers between target-pointing attitudes. After predicting the attitude profile, it was differentiated to obtain the time and angular acceleration profiles. The optimal maneuver reference profile was obtained by Bayesian-based optimization. To verify the performance of the proposed technique, the results of maneuvers in the 2–68° range were analyzed.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60068719","afid":"60068719","affilname":"Korea Aerospace Research Institute","affiliation-city":"Daejeon","affiliation-country":"South Korea"}],"pubmed-id":"37430563","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24077756400","authid":"24077756400","authname":"Yun S.T.","surname":"Yun","given-name":"Seok Teak","initials":"S.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60068719"}]}],"authkeywords":"data-based learning | deep neural networks | LEO satellites | reference attitude profiles | target-pointing attitude","article-number":"4650","source-id":"130124","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85160304495"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85160304495?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85160304495&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85160304495&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85160304495","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85160304495","eid":"2-s2.0-85160304495","dc:title":"Octonion Special Affine Fourier Transform: Pitt’s Inequality and the Uncertainty Principles","dc:creator":"Bhat M.Y.","prism:publicationName":"Fractal and Fractional","prism:eIssn":"25043110","prism:volume":"7","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May 2023","prism:doi":"10.3390/fractalfract7050356","dc:description":"The special affine Fourier transform (SAFT) is an extended version of the classical Fourier transform and incorporates various signal processing tools which include the Fourier transforms, the fractional Fourier transform, the linear canonical transform, and other related transforms.

Compared to directly expressing color images as vectors or matrices, the quaternion representation offers an effective alternative. There are several papers and works on this subject, as well as numerous definitions, hypotheses, and methodologies. Our observations indicate that the quaternion representation method is effective, and models and methods based on it have rapidly developed.

However, the hypercomplex moments are limited by the specific number of imaginary parts of the hypercomplex number, and the redundancy of imaginary parts or the overflow of image channels will occur when the number of imaginary parts does not fit the image structure. The multi-channel moments allow flexible adjustment of the number of channels, but their loose structure will result in the loss of correlation between multiple channels of images. Moreover, the hypercomplex moments and multi-channel moments cannot handle images with multi-dimensional structures such as light-field (LF) images. For the purpose of addressing the above problems, this paper proposes generalized hypercomplex continuous orthogonal moments (HCOMs) and extends them to multi-dimensional hypercomplex continuous orthogonal moments (MHCOMs) in multi-dimensional space. MHCOMs can be used to process images with arbitrary multi-dimensional structures, and when they are used for LF image processing, there is no need to map the LF images to two-dimensional space to change the multi-dimensional structural properties of LF images. By calculating MHCOMs of LF images, a set of multi-dimensional hypercomplex tensors containing robust feature information of LF images can be obtained, and the original LF images can be reconstructed using this information. Furthermore, the MHCOMs-based zero-watermarking scheme is designed for LF images, which has excellent robustness and can achieve lossless copyright protection for LF images.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018486","afid":"60018486","affilname":"Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016930","afid":"60016930","affilname":"Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013268","afid":"60013268","affilname":"Taiyuan University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Taiyuan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011592","afid":"60011592","affilname":"Qilu University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Jinan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55318994100","authid":"55318994100","orcid":"0000-0002-3742-5614","authname":"Wang C.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Chunpeng","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011592"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57729718600","authid":"57729718600","orcid":"0000-0002-0567-9388","authname":"Zhang Q.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Qinghua","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011592"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188991071","authid":"57188991071","authname":"Xia Z.","surname":"Xia","given-name":"Zhiqiu","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011592"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55966192200","authid":"55966192200","authname":"Zhou L.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Linna","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016930"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58081117900","authid":"58081117900","authname":"Wei Z.","surname":"Wei","given-name":"Ziqi","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018486"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209296515","authid":"57209296515","authname":"Zhang H.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Hao","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013268"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204589541","authid":"57204589541","authname":"Ma B.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Bin","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011592"}]}],"authkeywords":"Continuous orthogonal moments | Hypercomplex moments | Image reconstruction | Light-field images | Multi-dimensional moments | Zero-watermarking","article-number":"119553","source-id":"24201","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61802212","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85145202690"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85145202690?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85145202690&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85145202690&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0165168422004492"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85145202690","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85145202690","eid":"2-s2.0-85145202690","dc:title":"Quaternion tensor singular value decomposition using a flexible transform-based approach","dc:creator":"Miao J.","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing","prism:issn":"01651684","prism:volume":"206","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May 2023","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.sigpro.2022.108910","pii":"S0165168422004492","dc:description":"A flexible transform-based tensor product named ★QT-product for Lth-order (L≥3) quaternion tensors is proposed.

In the experiments, we have verified the effectiveness of the proposed TQt-SVD in the application of the best TQt-rank-s approximation for color videos represented by third-order quaternion tensors.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028009","afid":"60028009","affilname":"Yunnan University","affiliation-city":"Kunming","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201452670","authid":"57201452670","authname":"Miao J.","surname":"Miao","given-name":"Jifei","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028009"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003837546","authid":"7003837546","authname":"Kou K.I.","surname":"Kou","given-name":"Kit Ian","initials":"K.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image | Color video | Low-rank approximation | Quaternion tensor singular value decomposition","article-number":"108910","source-id":"25548","fund-acr":"UM","fund-no":"FDCT/0036/2021/AGJ","fund-sponsor":"Shanghai Science and Technology Development Foundation","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85144798945"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85144798945?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85144798945&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85144798945&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85144798945","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85144798945","eid":"2-s2.0-85144798945","dc:title":"Dense Packings via Lifts of Codes to Division Rings","dc:creator":"Gargava N.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","prism:issn":"00189448","prism:eIssn":"15579654","prism:volume":"69","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"2860-2873","prism:coverDate":"2023-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 May 2023","prism:doi":"10.1109/TIT.2022.3226028","dc:description":"We obtain algorithmically effective versions of the dense lattice sphere packings constructed from orders in $\\mathbb {Q}$ -division rings by the first author.

However, determining how to efficiently teach a robot to perform assembly manipulation trajectories from demonstration videos is a challenging issue. This article proposes a method integrating deep learning, image processing, and an iteration model to predict the real assembly manipulation trajectory of a human hand from a video without specific depth information. First, a pose estimation network, Keypoint-RCNN, is used to accurately estimate hand pose in the 2-D image of each frame in a video. Second, image processing is applied to map the 2-D hand pose estimated by the neural network with the real 3-D assembly space. An iteration model based on the trust region algorithm is proposed to solve for the quaternions and translation vectors of two frames. All the quaternions and translation vectors form the predicted assembly manipulation trajectories. Finally, a UR3 robot is used to imitate the assembly operation based on the predicted manipulation trajectories. The results show that the robot could successfully imitate various operations based on the predicted manipulation trajectories.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016835","afid":"60016835","affilname":"Beijing Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006623","afid":"60006623","affilname":"Shenyang Normal University","affiliation-city":"Shenyang","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57298260900","authid":"57298260900","authname":"Deng X.","surname":"Deng","given-name":"Xinjian","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55986543000","authid":"55986543000","orcid":"0000-0002-4881-2193","authname":"Liu J.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Jianhua","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58018784800","authid":"58018784800","authname":"Gong H.","surname":"Gong","given-name":"Honghui","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006623"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189076407","authid":"57189076407","orcid":"0000-0002-6810-3335","authname":"Gong H.","surname":"Gong","given-name":"Hao","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57297241000","authid":"57297241000","authname":"Huang J.","surname":"Huang","given-name":"Jiayu","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]}],"authkeywords":"Image processing | industrial robot | intelligent assembly | learning from demonstration","source-id":"144912","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"51935003","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85142815571"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85142815571?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85142815571&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85142815571&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85142815571","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85142815571","eid":"2-s2.0-85142815571","dc:title":"Quaternion-Valued Correlation Learning for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation","dc:creator":"Zheng Z.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","prism:issn":"10518215","prism:eIssn":"15582205","prism:volume":"33","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"2102-2115","prism:coverDate":"2023-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 May 2023","prism:doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2022.3223150","dc:description":"Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment unseen classes given only a few annotated samples. Encouraging progress has been made for FSS by leveraging semantic features learned from base classes with sufficient training samples to represent novel classes. The correlation-based methods lack the ability to consider interaction of the two subspace matching scores due to the inherent nature of the real-valued 2D convolutions. In this paper, we introduce a quaternion perspective on correlation learning and propose a novel Quaternion-valued Correlation Learning Network (QCLNet), with the aim to alleviate the computational burden of high-dimensional correlation tensor and explore internal latent interaction between query and support images by leveraging operations defined by the established quaternion algebra. Specifically, our QCLNet is formulated as a hyper-complex valued network and represents correlation tensors in the quaternion domain, which uses quaternion-valued convolution to explore the external relations of query subspace when considering the hidden relationship of the support sub-dimension in the quaternion space. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL- 5i and COCO- 20i datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods effectively.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60072904","afid":"60072904","affilname":"Macao Polytechnic University","affiliation-city":"Macau","affiliation-country":"Macao"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015609","afid":"60015609","affilname":"San Jose State University","affiliation-city":"San Jose","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007155","afid":"60007155","affilname":"Guangdong University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57286982200","authid":"57286982200","orcid":"0000-0003-4158-5597","authname":"Zheng Z.","surname":"Zheng","given-name":"Zewen","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007155"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56007342500","authid":"56007342500","orcid":"0000-0002-3640-3229","authname":"Huang G.","surname":"Huang","given-name":"Guoheng","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007155"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36562860900","authid":"36562860900","orcid":"0000-0002-7490-6695","authname":"Yuan X.","surname":"Yuan","given-name":"Xiaochen","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60072904"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003931852","authid":"7003931852","orcid":"0000-0003-1788-3746","authname":"Pun C.M.","surname":"Pun","given-name":"Chi Man","initials":"C.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57213269905","authid":"57213269905","orcid":"0000-0002-2540-2765","authname":"Liu H.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Hongrui","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015609"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57214008257","authid":"57214008257","orcid":"0000-0002-0633-7224","authname":"Ling W.K.","surname":"Ling","given-name":"Wing Kuen","initials":"W.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007155"}]}],"authkeywords":"correlation learning | Few-shot learning | quaternion-valued convolution | semantic segmentation","source-id":"26027","fund-no":"2020B1212060069","fund-sponsor":"Guangzhou Science and Technology Program key projects","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85131763564"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85131763564?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85131763564&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85131763564&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85131763564","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85131763564","eid":"2-s2.0-85131763564","dc:title":"Event-Triggered Quantized Quasisynchronization of Uncertain Quaternion-Valued Chaotic Neural Networks with Time-Varying Delay for Image Encryption","dc:creator":"Liu L.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","prism:issn":"21682267","prism:eIssn":"21682275","prism:volume":"53","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"3325-3336","prism:coverDate":"2023-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 May 2023","prism:doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2022.3176013","dc:description":"In this article, a class of quaternion-valued master-slave neural networks (NNs) with time-varying delay and parameter uncertainties was first established by conducting the extension from real-valued chaotic NNs to the quaternion field.

In virtue of the classical Lyapunov method and a generalized Halanay inequality, not only corresponding synchronization criteria were obtained to realize the quasisynchronization of master-slave NNs but also a precise upper bound was provided. Moreover, Zeno behavior can be eliminated under the presented scheme in this article. The accuracy of the theoretical outcomes was demonstrated by means of Chua's circuit.
