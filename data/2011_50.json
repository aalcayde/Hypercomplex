To reduce the drift, existing algorithms make use of gravity and earth magnetic field measured by accelerometers and magnetometers. Unfortunately, the gravity measurement can be strongly interfered by human motion acceleration. This paper presents a quaternion-based adaptive Kalman filter for drift-free orientation estimation. In this filter, the motion acceleration associated with the quaternion is included in the state vector, to compensate the effects which human body motion may have on the reliability of gravity measurement. Moreover, the process noise covariance is adapted based on the variation of sensor signals, to optimize the performance under human motion existence. The final experiments show that the proposed algorithm has least error compared with the existing methods, and the use of motion acceleration compensation together with the adaptive mechanism can improve the accuracy of human motion capture. © 2011 IEEE.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027363","afid":"60027363","affilname":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/109637346","afid":"109637346","affilname":"China-Singapore Institute of Digital Media","affiliation-city":"Singapore City","affiliation-country":"Singapore"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35323189700","authid":"35323189700","authname":"Sun S.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Shuyan","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"109637346"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36010162500","authid":"36010162500","authname":"Meng X.","surname":"Meng","given-name":"Xiaoli","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"109637346"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35098923400","authid":"35098923400","authname":"Ji L.","surname":"Ji","given-name":"Lianying","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"109637346"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34978689800","authid":"34978689800","authname":"Huang Z.","surname":"Huang","given-name":"Zhipei","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7409253494","authid":"7409253494","authname":"Wu J.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Jiankang","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"109637346"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive mechanism | Drift | Human motion capture | Kalman filter | Sensor fusion","article-number":"5977576","source-id":"19900193883","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80052232308"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80052232308?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80052232308&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80052232308&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80052232308","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:80052232308","eid":"2-s2.0-80052232308","dc:title":"A steganographic scheme for colour image authentication (SSCIA)","dc:creator":"Ghoshal N.","prism:publicationName":"International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology, ICRTIT 2011","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781457705885"}],"prism:pageRange":"826-831","prism:coverDate":"2011-09-05","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2011","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972302","dc:description":"This paper deals with a novel steganographic technique which demonstrates the colour image authentication technique in frequency domain based on the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The DFT is applied on sub-image block called mask of size 2 2 for frequency components of corresponding spatial component. This transforms process done from beginning to end mask in row major order of the carrier image. Image authentication is done by hiding secrete message/image into the transformed frequency components of carrier image. Four secrete message/image bits are fabricated within the transformed real frequency component of each carrier image byte except the LSB of first frequency component of each mask. After embedding, a delicate re-adjust phase is incorporated in all the frequency component of each mask, to keep the quantum value positive and non fractional in spatial domain. Robustness is achieved by hiding an authenticating or secretes message/image in the frequency component with positive and negatives both quantum values and invisibility is satisfied in spatial domain using delicate re-adjust phase. Inverse DFT (IDFT) is performed after embedding to transform embedded image in frequency domain to spatial domain. This novel technique is also applicable for secrete data transmission through carrier colour image by hiding secrete data. Experimental results conform that the proposed algorithm performs better than discrete cosine transformation (DCT), Quaternion Fourier Transformation (QFT) and Spatio Chromatic DFT (SCDFT) based schemes. © 2011 IEEE.","citedby-count":"14","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011023","afid":"60011023","affilname":"University of Kalyani","affiliation-city":"Kalyani","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005006672","authid":"7005006672","authname":"Ghoshal N.","surname":"Ghoshal","given-name":"Nabin","initials":"N."},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24605629500","authid":"24605629500","authname":"Mandal J.","surname":"Mandal","given-name":"J.

We propose a reduced-complexity WL-QLMS (RC-WL-QLMS) algorithm, and we show that using a real data vector, the RC-WL-QLMS achieves the same MSE of the WL-QLMS, with lower computational cost.

Traditionally, each component of such images is analyzed serially. Such an approach however has a main drawback in that it misses the information as to how the different parameters are correlated to each other. In this study, building upon a recent application in color image processing, themultipleMR parameters are combined to one entity and analyzed holistically using higher order Fourier transforms. The approach has been implemented in terms of classifying structures in MR images taken from a cohort of patients treated for glioblastoma multiforme. Our results show that, as opposed to a serial analysis, a holistic use of the inter correlation information embedded among individual parameters may be vital in detecting signals of interest that are not readily available.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016849","afid":"60016849","affilname":"University of Toronto","affiliation-city":"Toronto","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23007922100","authid":"23007922100","authname":"Assefa D.","surname":"Assefa","given-name":"Dawit","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016849"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57207898955","authid":"57207898955","authname":"Keller H.","surname":"Keller","given-name":"Harry","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016849"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005040826","authid":"7005040826","authname":"Jaffray D.A.","surname":"Jaffray","given-name":"David A.","initials":"D.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016849"}]}],"authkeywords":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) | Medical image processing | Multi parametric | Quaternion | Trinion","source-id":"19900193730","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80054968908"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80054968908?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80054968908&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80054968908&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80054968908","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:80054968908","eid":"2-s2.0-80054968908","dc:title":"Biquaternion vector-sensor array model and electromagnetic source localization","dc:creator":"Li D.","prism:publicationName":"Tien Tzu Hsueh Pao/Acta Electronica Sinica","prism:issn":"03722112","prism:volume":"39","prism:issueIdentifier":"9","prism:pageRange":"1997-2003","prism:coverDate":"2011-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"September 2011","dc:description":"Based on the quaternion formulation of Maxwell equations, a pure biquaternion model (PB-MODEL) for electromagnetic vector-sensor array is proposed.

The object space error function is a non-convex polynomial parameterized by quaternions in the rotation matrix space. The non-convex polynomial can be convex-relaxation to approach the global minimum, and the rotation matrix and translation can be computed in the global optimum. The numerical simulation demonstrates that the algorithm can reach the global minimum compared with the orthogonal iteration algorithm, and the results somewhat outperform those of the bundle adjustment.

Insects are an excellent model system for investigating the neural mechanisms that have evolved for this challenging task. Specialized small target motion detector (STMD) neurons in the optic lobes of the insect brain respond strongly even when the target size is below the resolution limit of the eye. Many STMDs also respond robustly to small targets against complex stationary or moving backgrounds. We hypothesized that this requires a complex mechanism to avoid breakthrough responses by background features, and yet to adequately amplify the weak signal of tiny targets. We compared responses of dragonfly STMD neurons to small targets that begin moving within the receptive field with responses to targets that approach the same location along longer trajectories. We find that responses along longer trajectories are strongly facilitated by a mechanism that builds up slowly over several hundred milliseconds. This allows the neurons to give sustained responses to continuous target motion, thus providing a possible explanation for their extraordinary sensitivity. © 2011 The Royal Society.","citedby-count":"35","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009512","afid":"60009512","affilname":"The University of Adelaide","affiliation-city":"Adelaide","affiliation-country":"Australia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003858","afid":"60003858","affilname":"Uppsala Universitet","affiliation-city":"Uppsala","affiliation-country":"Sweden"}],"pubmed-id":"21270026","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12783105400","authid":"12783105400","authname":"Nordström K.","surname":"Nordström","given-name":"Karin","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003858"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009512"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/22950079800","authid":"22950079800","authname":"Bolzon D.","surname":"Bolzon","given-name":"Douglas M.","initials":"D.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009512"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004519483","authid":"7004519483","authname":"O'Carroll D.","surname":"O'Carroll","given-name":"David C.","initials":"D.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009512"}]}],"authkeywords":"Hypercomplex | Motion vision | Response decay | Response onset | Spatial facilitation | Target detection","source-id":"145678","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherhybridgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Hybrid Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80051638278"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80051638278?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80051638278&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80051638278&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80051638278","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:80051638278","eid":"2-s2.0-80051638278","dc:title":"Maximum likelihood ICA of quaternion Gaussian vectors","dc:creator":"Vía J.","prism:publicationName":"ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - Proceedings","prism:issn":"15206149","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781457705397"}],"prism:pageRange":"4260-4263","prism:coverDate":"2011-08-18","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2011","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2011.5947294","dc:description":"This work considers the independent component analysis (ICA) of quaternion random vectors. In particular, we focus on the Gaussian case, and therefore the ICA problem is solved by exclusively exploiting the second-order statistics (SOS) of the observations. In the quaternion case, the SOS of a random vector are given by the covariance matrix and three complementary covariance matrices. Thus, quaternion ICA amounts to jointly diagonalizing these four matrices. Following a maximum likelihood (ML) approach, we show that the ML-ICA problem reduces to the minimization of a cost function, which can be interpreted as a measure of the entropy loss due to the correlation among the estimated sources. In order to solve the non-convex ML-ICA problem, we propose a practical quasi-Newton algorithm based on quadratic local approximations of the cost function. Finally, the practical performance and potential application of the proposed technique is illustrated by means of numerical examples. © 2011 IEEE.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015179","afid":"60015179","affilname":"Universidad de Cantabria","affiliation-city":"Santander","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008592","afid":"60008592","affilname":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8561499600","authid":"8561499600","authname":"Vía J.","surname":"Vía","given-name":"Javier","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015179"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603425703","authid":"6603425703","authname":"Palomar D.","surname":"Palomar","given-name":"Daniel P.","initials":"D.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008592"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602194711","authid":"6602194711","authname":"Vielva L.","surname":"Vielva","given-name":"Luis","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015179"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003654192","authid":"7003654192","authname":"Santamaría I.","surname":"Santamaría","given-name":"Ignacio","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015179"}]}],"authkeywords":"Independent component analysis | maximum likelihood | properness | quaternion | second-order statistics","article-number":"5947294","source-id":"110544","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80051633805"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80051633805?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80051633805&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80051633805&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80051633805","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:80051633805","eid":"2-s2.0-80051633805","dc:title":"Blind extraction of improper quaternion sources","dc:creator":"Javidi S.","prism:publicationName":"ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - Proceedings","prism:issn":"15206149","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781457705397"}],"prism:pageRange":"3708-3711","prism:coverDate":"2011-08-18","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2011","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.2011.5947156","dc:description":"Blind extraction of quaternion-valued latent sources is addressed based on their local temporal properties.

Authentication is done through embedding secrete message/image into the transformed frequency components of the source image at message originating node. The DFT is applied on sub-image block called mask of size 2 × 2 in row major order where authenticating message/image bit is fabricated within the real frequency component of each source image byte except the first frequency component of each mask. In order to retain the quantum value positive and non fractional in spatial domain, a delicate readjustment phase is used in the first frequency component of each mask as a post embedding handler. Robustness is achieved through embedding secrete message/image into both positive and negatives frequency component of source image and invisibility is satisfied in spatial domain using delicate re-adjust phase. Inverse DFT (IDFT) is performed after embedding to transform embedded image from frequency domain to spatial domain and the embedded image is transmitted across the network. At the destination node authentication is done through extraction process of embedded image.

This paper presents a two-layer filter framework based on IMM to track human motion. First, a method of model based points location is proposed to detect key feature points automatically and the filter in the first layer is performed to estimate the undetected points. Second, multiple models of motion are learned by the prior motion data with ridge regression and the IMM algorithm is used to estimate the quaternion vectors of joints rotation.

To circumvent the stringent standard analyticity conditions which are prohibitive to the development of nonlinear adaptive quaternion-valued estimation models, we use the fact that stochastic gradient learning algorithms require only local analyticity at the operating point in the estimation space. It is shown that the quaternion-valued exponential function is locally analytic, and, since local analyticity extends to polynomials, products, and ratios, we show that a class of transcendental nonlinear functions can serve as activation functions in nonlinear and neural adaptive models. This provides a unifying framework for the derivation of gradient-based learning algorithms in the quaternion domain, and the derived algorithms are shown to have the same generic form as their real-and complex-valued counterparts. To make such models second-order optimal for the generality of quaternion signals (both circular and noncircular), we use recent developments in augmented quaternion statistics to introduce widely linear versions of the proposed nonlinear adaptive quaternion valued filters. This allows full exploitation of second-order information in the data, contained both in the covariance and pseudocovariances to cater rigorously for second-order noncircularity (improperness), and the corresponding power mismatch in the signal components. Simulations over a range of circular and noncircular synthetic processes and a real world 3-D noncircular wind signal support the approach. © 2011 IEEE.","citedby-count":"144","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015150","afid":"60015150","affilname":"Imperial College London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"pubmed-id":"21712159","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35148333700","authid":"35148333700","authname":"Ujang B.C.","surname":"Ujang","given-name":"Bukhari Che","initials":"B.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57829404900","authid":"57829404900","authname":"Took C.C.","surname":"Took","given-name":"Clive Cheong","initials":"C.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006513328","authid":"7006513328","authname":"Mandic D.P.D.","surname":"Mandic","given-name":"Danilo P.D.","initials":"D.P.D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]}],"authkeywords":"augmented quaternion statistics | H-circularity | nonlinear adaptive filtering | quaternion least mean square | widely linear modeling | widely linear quaternion least mean square | wind prediction","article-number":"5934421","source-id":"24243","fund-acr":"EPSRC","fund-no":"EP/H026266/1","fund-sponsor":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79960700479"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79960700479?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=79960700479&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=79960700479&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79960700479","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:79960700479","eid":"2-s2.0-79960700479","dc:title":"Finite-time attitude tracking control for spacecraft using terminal sliding mode and chebyshev neural network","dc:creator":"Zou A.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics","prism:issn":"10834419","prism:volume":"41","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"950-963","prism:coverDate":"2011-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"August 2011","prism:doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2101592","dc:description":"A finite-time attitude tracking control scheme is proposed for spacecraft using terminal sliding mode and Chebyshev neural network (NN) (CNN). The four-parameter representations (quaternion) are used to describe the spacecraft attitude for global representation without singularities. The attitude state (i.e., attitude and velocity) error dynamics is transformed to a double integrator dynamics with a constraint on the spacecraft attitude. With consideration of this constraint, a novel terminal sliding manifold is proposed for the spacecraft. In order to guarantee that the output of the NN used in the controller is bounded by the corresponding bound of the approximated unknown function, a switch function is applied to generate a switching between the adaptive NN control and the robust controller. Meanwhile, a CNN, whose basis functions are implemented using only desired signals, is introduced to approximate the desired nonlinear function and bounded external disturbances online, and the robust term based on the hyperbolic tangent function is applied to counteract NN approximation errors in the adaptive neural control scheme. Most importantly, the finite-time stability in both the reaching phase and the sliding phase can be guaranteed by a Lyapunov-based approach. Finally, numerical simulations on the attitude tracking control of spacecraft in the presence of an unknown mass moment of inertia matrix, bounded external disturbances, and control input constraints are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller. © 2011 IEEE.","citedby-count":"413","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030838","afid":"60030838","affilname":"Toronto Metropolitan University","affiliation-city":"Toronto","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018486","afid":"60018486","affilname":"Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14038430500","authid":"14038430500","authname":"Zou A.","surname":"Zou","given-name":"An Min","initials":"A.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030838"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402676359","authid":"7402676359","authname":"Kumar K.","surname":"Kumar","given-name":"Krishna Dev","initials":"K.D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030838"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13102644800","authid":"13102644800","authname":"Hou Z.","surname":"Hou","given-name":"Zeng Guang","initials":"Z.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018486"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192258685","authid":"57192258685","authname":"Liu X.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Xi","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030838"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive control | attitude tracking | Chebyshev neural network (NN) (CNN) | spacecraft | terminal sliding mode (TSM)","article-number":"5699934","source-id":"12955","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"60 775 043","fund-sponsor":"Ryerson University","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79955473108"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79955473108?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=79955473108&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=79955473108&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0165168411000673"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79955473108","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:79955473108","eid":"2-s2.0-79955473108","dc:title":"The trinion Fourier transform of color images","dc:creator":"Assefa D.","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing","prism:issn":"01651684","prism:volume":"91","prism:issueIdentifier":"8","prism:pageRange":"1887-1900","prism:coverDate":"2011-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"August 2011","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.sigpro.2011.02.011","pii":"S0165168411000673","dc:description":"Any color may be represented in terms of three components (RGB or HSL) or four components (CMYK). For the four component color representation the use of quaternions, with one real and three imaginary components, is natural. By setting one component to zero, quaternions have been used in RGB or HSL representation of colors and color images. In this paper a new quantity, trinion, with one real and two imaginary components, is introduced and its use in color image representation is examined. The goal is to see if significant efficiencies in representation, analysis and computation involving three component color images accrue with the use of trinions. Two versions of the trinion Fourier transform (TFT) are introduced and it is shown that using TFT is preferable for combined analysis of three component color images rather than separate monochromatic analysis of each component and use of quaternions. Joint space-wavenumber localized trinion S (TS) transform with a two-dimensional Gaussian window function that scales with wavenumbers is also presented. Invertibility, rotation invariance, and computational aspects of the TS transform are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Given the image motion, the stable localization of vehicle is computed by the 4-DOF ego-motion model and RANSAC algorithm, which can efficiently estimate the instantaneous steering angle and traveling distance even if the vehicle runs on bumpy road. The proposed algorithms are successfully validated on videos from an automotive platform. Furthermore, the localization results from our method are compared to the ground truth measured with a GPS/INS joint system, and the trajectory recovered from the estimated localization parameters is superimposed onto a digital map.

In tracking, motion models currently in effect switches from one to another in order to match the present human motion mode. The motion model is activated according to the change in projection angle of kinematic chain, and topological and compatibility relationship among them. It is terminated according to their model probabilities. And likely model set schemes of VSMM is used to estimate the quaternion vectors of joints rotation. Experiments using two videos demonstrate this tracking framework is efficient with respect to 3D pose and 2D projection. © 2011 SPIE.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025578","afid":"60025578","affilname":"Xidian University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26636998100","authid":"26636998100","authname":"Han H.","surname":"Han","given-name":"Hong","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55705736500","authid":"55705736500","authname":"Chen Z.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Zhichao","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102491544","authid":"7102491544","authname":"Jiao L.C.","surname":"Jiao","given-name":"L.
