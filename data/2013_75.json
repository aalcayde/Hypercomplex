The recently proposed polar harmonic transforms (PHTs) have provided a set of powerful tools for image representation. However, two-dimensional transforms cannot handle color image in a holistic manner. To extend the nice properties of PHTs to color image processing, we generalize PHTs from the complex field to hypercomplex field in this letter, and quaternion polar harmonic transforms (QPHTs) are developed based on quaternion algebra. Furthermore, the properties of QPHTs are studied via quaternion computation, including the orthogonality of quaternion kernels, the relationships between different transforms and their rotation invariance. Experimental results reveal that compared with complex PHTs, the quaternion transforms can make a more compact and discriminative representation of color image. Moreover, QPHTs can well capture the chromatic features and exploit the inter-channel redundancies of color image. © 1994-2012 IEEE.","citedby-count":"38","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019533","afid":"60019533","affilname":"Tianjin University","affiliation-city":"Tianjin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55145899000","authid":"55145899000","authname":"Li Y.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Yue Nan","initials":"Y.N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019533"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image processing | image description | orthogonal transforms | quaternion polar harmonic transforms","article-number":"6530686","source-id":"17316","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84879873107"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84879873107?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84879873107&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84879873107&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84879873107","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84879873107","eid":"2-s2.0-84879873107","dc:title":"A wearable inertial-sensing-based body sensor network for shoulder range of motion assessment","dc:creator":"Hsu Y.L.","prism:publicationName":"ICOT 2013 - 1st International Conference on Orange Technologies","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781467359368"}],"prism:pageRange":"328-331","prism:coverDate":"2013-07-12","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2013","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICOT.2013.6521225","dc:description":"This paper presents a wearable inertial-sensing-based body sensor network (BSN) composed of two inertial modules that are placed on human upper limb for real-time human motion capture applications.

Nowadays, the traditional evaluation of analytical signals may not always provide the desired results for the chemical and pharmaceutical analysis, where most of the analysis processes is hyper complex. Hence, combined application of conventional instrumental methods and some chemometric signal processing methods can be necessary for the analysis of complex systems. As a result, conventional analysis techniques coupled with signal processing tools enhance their ability of resolution, separation and analysis tremendously. In this context, several signal processing tools have been developed for many application areas from data analysis to data compression. One of the newest additions has been wavelets. Wavelet transform (WT) can be classified into two categories; discrete wavelets transform and continuous wavelets transform. WT approach is a powerful signal processing tool for data reduction, denoising, baseline correction and resolution of overlapping spectra. In our previous studies, the WT signal processing tools in combination with conventional spectral analysis techniques were applied to the analysis of drugs in multicomponent samples. Very recently, fractional wavelet transform was successfully applied to increase the lower signal content and to reduce the spectral data length for the drug analysis. In this review I will give some typical applications of the wavelet transforms to spectrophotometric, voltammetric and chromatographic signals for the analysis of drug substances.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012603","afid":"60012603","affilname":"Ankara Üniversitesi","affiliation-city":"Ankara","affiliation-country":"Turkey"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"re","subtypeDescription":"Review","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003965179","authid":"7003965179","authname":"Dinç E.","surname":"Dinç","given-name":"Erdal","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012603"}]}],"authkeywords":"Chemometrics | Continuous wavelet transform | Discrete wavelet transform | Drug analysis | Signal processing | Wavelet transform","source-id":"21374","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84884392170"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84884392170?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84884392170&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84884392170&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84884392170","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84884392170","eid":"2-s2.0-84884392170","dc:title":"Iterative algorithm for angular matching of group point objects with a priori uncertainty of parameters","dc:creator":"Furman Y.A.","prism:publicationName":"Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis","prism:issn":"10546618","prism:eIssn":"15556212","prism:volume":"23","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"381-388","prism:coverDate":"2013-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2013","prism:doi":"10.1134/S1054661813030048","dc:description":"An iterative algorithm for angular matching of two images of three-dimensional objects based on the properties of the normalized scalar product is considered.

First, a color image is represented by a pure quaternion matrix by using the quaternion representation of color images. After that, the quaternion mean square error (QMSE) between the restored color image and the original one is defined based on the algebra of quaternions. Then, combining with the essential idea of the non-local means filter, the optimal weights for minimizing the tight bound of QMSE are obtained by using the method of Lagrange multipliers. Finally, the weighted average of the observed quaternion representation is obtained, and a quaternion optimal weights non-local means filter (QOWNLMF) for Poisson noise removal for color image is constructed by using the optimal weights. The comparative experiment results of commonly used standard images demonstrate that the proposed filter performs better than the existing quaternion filters and the conventional vector-based filter and component-wise filter.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60106849","afid":"60106849","affilname":"Nanjing Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143","afid":"60064143","affilname":"Nanjing University of Information Science &amp; Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005244","afid":"60005244","affilname":"Southeast University","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004130","afid":"60004130","affilname":"Universite de Bretagne-Sud","affiliation-city":"Lorient","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36805188500","authid":"36805188500","authname":"Chen B.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Beijing","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55836038500","authid":"55836038500","authname":"Dai H.","surname":"Dai","given-name":"Hui","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60106849"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192312539","authid":"57192312539","authname":"Liu Q.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Quansheng","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004130"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7203086899","authid":"7203086899","authname":"Shu H.","surname":"Shu","given-name":"Huazhong","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image denoising | Non-local means filter | Optimal weights filter | Poisson noise | Quaternion","source-id":"21174","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84874603989"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84874603989?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84874603989&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84874603989&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0165168412004616"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84874603989","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84874603989","eid":"2-s2.0-84874603989","dc:title":"A class of quaternion valued affine projection algorithms","dc:creator":"Jahanchahi C.","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing","prism:issn":"01651684","prism:volume":"93","prism:issueIdentifier":"7","prism:pageRange":"1712-1723","prism:coverDate":"2013-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2013","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.sigpro.2012.12.019","pii":"S0165168412004616","dc:description":"The strictly linear quaternion valued affine projection algorithm (QAPA) and its widely linear counterpart (WLQAPA) are introduced, in order to provide fast converging stochastic gradient learning in the quaternion domain, for the processing of both second order circular (proper) and second order noncircular (improper) signals.

At first, images are segmented to patches by a regular grid, and for each patch, we extract color features by using quaternion singular value decomposition (QSVD) method, and the grey features are extracted by Gabor filter and then by using orientation histogram to describe the grey information. After that, we combine the color features and the orientation histogram together with the same weight to obtain the descriptor for each patch. All the patch descriptors are clustered to get visual words for each category. Then we apply KPCA to the visual words to get the subspaces of the category. The descriptors of a test image then are projected to the subspaces of all categories to get the projection length to all categories for the test image. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) with linear kernel function is used to get the scene classification performance. We experiment with three classification situations on OT8 dataset and compare our method with the typical scene classification method, probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA), and the results confirm the feasibility of our method. © 2013 Ji Li and Zhen Liu.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023380","afid":"60023380","affilname":"Chongqing University","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113657663","afid":"113657663","affilname":"Key Laboratory for Dependable Service Computing in Cyber Physics Society of Ministry of Education","affiliation-city":null,"affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36623858400","authid":"36623858400","authname":"Li J.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Ji","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023380"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113657663"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191688385","authid":"57191688385","authname":"Liu Z.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Zhen","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023380"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113657663"}]}],"article-number":"367105","source-id":"13082","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84883480092"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84883480092?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84883480092&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84883480092&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84883480092","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84883480092","eid":"2-s2.0-84883480092","dc:title":"Research for micro attitude acquisition system based on DSC and MEMS","dc:creator":"Luo Q.","prism:publicationName":"Chinese Journal of Sensors and Actuators","prism:issn":"10041699","prism:volume":"26","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"861-864","prism:coverDate":"2013-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2013","prism:doi":"10.3969/j.issn.1004-1699.2013.06.021","dc:description":"Aiming at the high cost, large size and severe dependence on GPS of UAV Attitude Acquisition System, an low-cost micro attitude acquisition system was designed based on MEMS sensor ADIS16405 and digital singal controller TMS320F28335 (abbr.

An approach for effective hardware implementation of the proposed algorithm, HW-QES, is discussed. The HW-QES uses addition and shift operations. Extension of quaternion approach to another hyper-complex number systems, octonions, is used for designing a new hardware-oriented encryption algorithm, HW-OES. Experimental results show that the proposed M-QES and HW-QES are six-eight times more effective in the encryption quality of signals than the original QES. Additionally, M-QES and HW-OES are shown to be significantly more effective in the encryption quality of images than the original QES and wellknown AES.

First, luminance distances and chromaticity differences that are represented in quaternion form are combined together to measure color distances between color pixels. Then, based on this new color distance mechanism, the samples along horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions in current frame and the samples of adjacent frames on motion trajectory are used to detect whether each pixel is noisy or not. By analyzing the spatiotemporal order-statistic information about these directional samples, the video pixels are classified into noise free and noisy. Finally, 3-D weighted vector median filtering is performed on the pixels that are judged as noisy, and the other pixels remain unchanged.

Feature extraction is one of the main steps of a face recognition process, where it is possible to alleviate the illumination effects on face images. In order to increase the accuracy of recognition tasks, different methods for obtaining illumination invariant features have been developed. The aim of this work is to compare two different ways to represent face image descriptions in terms of their illumination invariant properties for face recognition. The first representation is constructed following the structure of complex numbers and the second one is based on quaternion numbers. Using four different face description approaches both representations are constructed, transformed into frequency domain and expressed in polar coordinates. The most illumination invariant component of each frequency domain representation is determined and used as the representative information of the face image. Verification and identification experiments are then performed in order to compare the discriminative power of the selected components.

The quaternion domain facilitates modeling and processing of four-dimensional real signals (or two-dimensional complex signals). Based on the quaternion model of an airborne EM vector-sensor, a quaternion spatial matched filter (QSMF) is presented and its characteristics are analyzed. The quaternion-valued output y(n) of the QSMF consists of two complex components y1(n) and y2(n). The analysis in theory highlights the fact that y2(n) includes only the interference component and noise, but doesn't include the desired signal. By employing y2(n) to cancel the interference component in y 1(n), we propose an interference cancellation algorithm (ICA) of the QSMF. In the presence of a strong interference, the ICA can improve the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Based on the interference cancellation structure, we propose two schemes of combined QSMF and complex minimum variance distortionless response (CMVDR) beamformer (one is referred to QSMF-CMVDR and the other is referred to QSMF-DCMVDR) for an airborne EM vector-sensors array. The advantages of the proposed beamformers are that the interference can be canceled by ICA of the QSMF and the additive noise can be reduced by CMVDR beamformer. The output SNR expressions of two combined beamformers that we derive reveal that the output SNR of the QSMF-DCMVDR beamformer is superior to that of a conventional linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer. And in the presence of the coherent (or correlated) interferences, two combined beamformers are not subject to performance degradation. Simulation results are in agreement with our analysis. © 1965-2011 IEEE.","citedby-count":"24","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073486","afid":"60073486","affilname":"Aviation University of Air Force","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007711","afid":"60007711","affilname":"Jilin University","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8534150300","authid":"8534150300","authname":"Tao J.","surname":"Tao","given-name":"Jian Wu","initials":"J.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073486"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13310202400","authid":"13310202400","authname":"Chang W.","surname":"Chang","given-name":"Wen Xiu","initials":"W.X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007711"}]}],"article-number":"6494413","source-id":"17336","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84876116452"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84876116452?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84876116452&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84876116452&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0167865513000895"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84876116452","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84876116452","eid":"2-s2.0-84876116452","dc:title":"Phases measure of image sharpness based on quaternion wavelet","dc:creator":"Liu Y.","prism:publicationName":"Pattern Recognition Letters","prism:issn":"01678655","prism:volume":"34","prism:issueIdentifier":"9","prism:pageRange":"1063-1070","prism:coverDate":"2013-04-17","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2013","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.patrec.2013.03.002","pii":"S0167865513000895","dc:description":"We present two novel and simple image sharpness metrics based on the quaternion wavelet transform. The result of quaternion wavelet decomposition can be transformed into the form of one magnitude with three phases (α, θ, α). We exploit the new interpretation of phases (α, θ) through the distributions of quaternion wavelet coefficients, and from the characteristics of these two phases, we construct two simple but effective sharpness metrics. We use quaternion wavelet transform to decompose the natural images, and then find the relationship between the blur degree and the distribution histograms of high/low frequencies coefficients of the two phases, respectively. We employ the variance of coefficients distribution to detect the blur degree and achieve the function of sharpness metric. Finally, experiments are conducted on natural images and the results indicate that the proposed metric can exhibit better performance than existing sharpness metrics, such as variance, image gradient, wavelet and eigenvalue based methods. The most important feature of one proposed metric is that it can provide consistent results for different natural images with the same blur degree, which of the other is robust to noise.
