This supports abstract data types with multiple inheritance (in roughly the sense of object-oriented programming), several forms of polymorphism and overloading, partial operations (as total on equationally defined subsorts), exception handling, and an operational semantics based on term rewriting. We give the basic algebraic constructions for OSA, including quotient, image, product and term algebra, and we prove their basic properties, including quotient, homomorphism, and initiality theorems. The paper's major mathematical results include a notion of OSA deduction, a completeness theorem for it, and an OSA Birkhoff variety theorem. We also develop conditional OSA, including initiality, completeness, and McKinsey-Malcev quasivariety theorems, and we reduce OSA to (conditional) MSA, which allows lifting many known MSA results to OSA. Retracts, which intuitively are left inverses to subsort inclusions, provide relatively inexpensive run-time error handling. We show that it is safe to add retracts to any OSA signature, in the sense that it gives rise to a conservative extension. A final section compares and contrasts many different approaches to OSA. This paper also includes several examples demonstrating the flexibility and applicability of OSA, including some standard benchmarks like stack and list, as well as a much more substantial example, the number hierarchy from the naturals up to the quaternions. © 1992.","citedby-count":"312","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026851","afid":"60026851","affilname":"University of Oxford","affiliation-city":"Oxford","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708","afid":"60012708","affilname":"Stanford University","affiliation-city":"Palo Alto","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000461","afid":"60000461","affilname":"SRI International","affiliation-city":"Menlo Park","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24798843200","authid":"24798843200","authname":"Goguen J.A.","surname":"Goguen","given-name":"Joseph A.","initials":"J.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026851"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000461"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7103153821","authid":"7103153821","authname":"Meseguer J.","surname":"Meseguer","given-name":"José","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000461"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012708"}]}],"source-id":"20571","fund-acr":"NSF","fund-no":"MCS82013XO","fund-sponsor":"National Science Foundation","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0005305322"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0005305322?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0005305322&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0005305322&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-002001909290009K"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0005305322","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0005305322","eid":"2-s2.0-0005305322","dc:title":"On the multiplication of reduced biquaternions and applications","dc:creator":"Dimitrov V.S.","prism:publicationName":"Information Processing Letters","prism:issn":"00200190","prism:volume":"43","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"161-164","prism:coverDate":"1992-09-14","prism:coverDisplayDate":"14 September 1992","prism:doi":"10.1016/0020-0190(92)90009-K","pii":"0020-0190(92)90009-K","dc:description":"We present two efficient algorithms for the multiplication of the so-called reduced biquaternions.

The mathematical formulations are presented along with experimental results. © 1992.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023345","afid":"60023345","affilname":"Indian Space Research Organisation","affiliation-city":"Bengaluru","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7007059503","authid":"7007059503","authname":"Mukundan R.","surname":"Mukundan","given-name":"R.","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023345"}]}],"source-id":"31708","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0026984511"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0026984511?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0026984511&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0026984511&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0026984511","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0026984511","eid":"2-s2.0-0026984511","dc:title":"3-D object recognition using fuzzy quaternions","dc:creator":"Ngan K.","prism:publicationName":"IEE Proceedings, Part I: Communications, Speech and Vision","prism:issn":"09563776","prism:volume":"139","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"561-568","prism:coverDate":"1992-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"Dec","prism:doi":"10.1049/ip-i-2.1992.0075","dc:description":"A new discrimination method based on fuzzy subset theory is proposed. This approach uses Zernike moment invariants of the silhouette of the unknown object to form a set of fuzzy-weighted quantities called fuzzy quaternions. These are matched against those of known objects at predetermined viewpoints. To speed up the recognition process, a modified simplex version of the Nelder-Mead algorithm is utilized. Results obtained demonstrate the potential of the fuzzy quaternion as a viable basis for discrimination.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019578","afid":"60019578","affilname":"Monash University","affiliation-city":"Melbourne","affiliation-country":"Australia"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005884930","authid":"7005884930","authname":"Ngan K.","surname":"Ngan","given-name":"K.

In electron microscopy of single macromolecules the molecular projection directions are not known and must be determined a posteriori from the projection images themselves. The algorithm presented achieves such a determination by using the central-section theorem, geo­metrical techniques, and quaternion mathematics. The quality of the solution is tested in relation to image noise, angular error in the input data, number of intercompared projections used to generate common-axis data, and number of iterations. Correct determination of mutual alignments is achieved despite significant errors in the input data, indicating that the method should be applicable to electron microscopy problems. © 1992 Optical Society of America.","citedby-count":"47","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016849","afid":"60016849","affilname":"University of Toronto","affiliation-city":"Toronto","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003264137","authid":"7003264137","authname":"Farrow N.","surname":"Farrow","given-name":"Neil A.","initials":"N.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016849"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005603129","authid":"7005603129","authname":"Ottensmeyer F.","surname":"Ottensmeyer","given-name":"F.
