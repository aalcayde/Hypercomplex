It is shown that, with the assistance of a bicomplex vector field, defined as a combination of the electric and the magnetic fields, the number of unknown quantities is practically reduced by half, whereas the Helmholtz equation may no longer be necessary in the development of the final solution. Bicomplex, first order differential equations are involved, instead of conventional, complex second order equations, and the solution procedure is greatly simplified. A direct consequence of this observation is the derivation of closed form solutions of the Maxwell's equations for a special class of inhomogeneous media, which cannot be easily extracted from the Helmholtz equation alone.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002947","afid":"60002947","affilname":"National Technical University of Athens","affiliation-city":"Athens","affiliation-country":"Greece"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003629437","authid":"7003629437","authname":"Anastassiu H.T.","surname":"Anastassiu","given-name":"Hristos T.","initials":"H.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002947"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603316828","authid":"6603316828","authname":"Atlamazoglou P.E.","surname":"Atlamazoglou","given-name":"Prodromos E.","initials":"P.E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002947"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35571264900","authid":"35571264900","authname":"Kaklamani D.I.","surname":"Kaklamani","given-name":"Dimitra I.","initials":"D.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002947"}]}],"source-id":"53507","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035771394"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035771394?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0035771394&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0035771394&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035771394","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0035771394","eid":"2-s2.0-0035771394","dc:title":"Photon echo possibilities under information processing in hyper complex space","dc:creator":"Leukhin A.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","prism:issn":"0277786X","prism:volume":"4605","prism:pageRange":"124-133","prism:coverDate":"2001-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2001","prism:doi":"10.1117/12.447951","dc:description":"Mode of photon echo (PE) exciting is theoretically considered, when in quality the pulse-code is used a set of pulses with the different time and polarizing characteristics.

Indeed, very often information about 3D objects can be obtained by computer tomographic reconstruction, 3D magnetic resonance imaging, passive 3D sensors or active range finders. Due to that algorithms of systematic derivation of 3D moment invariants should be developed for 3D colour object recognition. In this work we proposed an elegant theory which allows to describe many such invariants. Our theory is based on the theory of triplet numbers and quaternions. We propose triplet-quaternion-valued invariants, which are related to the descriptions of objects as the zero sets of implicit polynomials. These are global invariants which show great promise for recognition of complicated objects. Triplet-quaternion-valued invariants have good discriminating power for computer recognition of 3D colour objects using statistical pattern recognition methods. For fast computation of triplet-quaternion-valued invariants we use modular arithmetic of Galois fields and rings, which maps calculation of invariants to fast number theoretical Fourier-Galois-Hamilton-transform.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60103702","afid":"60103702","affilname":"Ural Federal University","affiliation-city":"Yekaterinburg","affiliation-country":"Russian Federation"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701610877","authid":"6701610877","authname":"Labunets V.G.","surname":"Labunets","given-name":"Valeri G.","initials":"V.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60103702"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7801405327","authid":"7801405327","authname":"Labunets-Rundblad E.V.","surname":"Labunets-Rundblad","given-name":"Ekaterina V.","initials":"E.V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60103702"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35232592700","authid":"35232592700","authname":"Astola J.","surname":"Astola","given-name":"Jaakko","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60103702"}]}],"authkeywords":"3D colour image | Fast algorithms | Invariants | Moments | Pattern recognition | Quaternions | Triplet numbers","source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035761231"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035761231?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0035761231&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0035761231&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035761231","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0035761231","eid":"2-s2.0-0035761231","dc:title":"Is the brain a \"Clifford algebra quantum computer\"?","dc:creator":"Labunets V.G.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","prism:issn":"0277786X","prism:volume":"4453","prism:pageRange":"134-145","prism:coverDate":"2001-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2001","prism:doi":"10.1117/12.447643","dc:description":"We propose a novel method to calculate invariants of colour and multicolour images.

The technique is based on least-squares analysis and on the Hayati and Mirmirani kinematic modeling convention for closed kinematic chains. The measurement system consists of a single camera mounted on the robot's wrist. The camera measures position and orientation of a passive target in six degrees of freedom. Target position is evaluated by applying least-squares analysis on an overdetermined system of equations based on the quaternion representation of the finite rotation formula. To enhance the accuracy of the measurement, a variety of image processing functions including subpixel interpolation are applied.","citedby-count":"22","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021001","afid":"60021001","affilname":"Union College, Schenectady","affiliation-city":"Schenectady","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011832","afid":"60011832","affilname":"Université de Sherbrooke","affiliation-city":"Sherbrooke","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100426881","afid":"100426881","affilname":"Walsh Inc","affiliation-city":"Montreal","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56213249500","authid":"56213249500","authname":"Rousseau P.","surname":"Rousseau","given-name":"Patrick","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"100426881"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35830013200","authid":"35830013200","authname":"Desrochers A.","surname":"Desrochers","given-name":"Alain","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011832"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602984273","authid":"6602984273","authname":"Krouglicof N.","surname":"Krouglicof","given-name":"Nicholas","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021001"}]}],"authkeywords":"Calibration | Machine vision | Model | Parameter identification | Robot","source-id":"18028","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035558199"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035558199?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0035558199&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0035558199&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035558199","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0035558199","eid":"2-s2.0-0035558199","dc:title":"An extended Kalman filter for quaternion-based orientation estimation using MARG sensors","dc:creator":"Marins J.L.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","prism:volume":"4","prism:pageRange":"2003-2011","prism:coverDate":"2001-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2001","dc:description":"This paper presents an extended Kalman filter for real-time estimation of rigid body orientation using the newly developed MARG (Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity) sensors. Each MARG sensor contains a three-axis magnetometer, a three-axis angular rate sensor, and a three-axis accelerometer. The filter represents rotations using quaternions rather than Euler angles, which eliminates the long-standing problem of singularities associated with attitude estimation. A process model for rigid body angular motions and angular rate measurements is defined. The process model converts angular rates into quaternion rates, which are integrated to obtain quaternions. The Gauss-Newton iteration algorithm is utilized to find the best quaternion that relates the measured accelerations and earth magnetic field in the body coordinate frame to calculated values in the earth coordinate frame. The best quaternion is used as part of the measurements for the Kalman filter. As a result of this approach, the measurement equations of the Kalman filter become linear, and the computational requirements are significantly reduced, making it possible to estimate orientation in real time. Extensive testing of the filter with synthetic data and actual sensor data proved it to be satisfactory. Test cases included the presence of large initial errors as well as high noise levels. In all cases the filter was able to converge and accurately track rotational motions.","citedby-count":"443","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033012","afid":"60033012","affilname":"Naval Postgraduate School","affiliation-city":"Monterey","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602689130","authid":"6602689130","authname":"Marins J.L.","surname":"Marins","given-name":"João Luís","initials":"J.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033012"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203057010","authid":"57203057010","authname":"Yun X.","surname":"Yun","given-name":"Xiaoping","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033012"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005745121","authid":"7005745121","authname":"Bachmann E.R.","surname":"Bachmann","given-name":"Eric R.","initials":"E.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033012"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004639231","authid":"7004639231","authname":"McGhee R.B.","surname":"McGhee","given-name":"Robert B.","initials":"R.B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033012"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003540409","authid":"7003540409","authname":"Zyda M.J.","surname":"Zyda","given-name":"Michael J.","initials":"M.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033012"}]}],"source-id":"66854","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035503560"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035503560?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0035503560&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0035503560&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035503560","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0035503560","eid":"2-s2.0-0035503560","dc:title":"Hypercomplex signals - A novel extension of the analytic signal to the multidimensional case","dc:creator":"Bülow T.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","prism:issn":"1053587X","prism:volume":"49","prism:issueIdentifier":"11","prism:pageRange":"2844-2852","prism:coverDate":"2001-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2001","prism:doi":"10.1109/78.960432","pii":"S1053587X01092406","dc:description":"The construction of Gabor's complex signal - which is also known as the analytic signal - provides direct access to a real one-dimensional (1-D) signal's local amplitude and phase. The complex signal is built from a real signal by adding its Hilbert transform - which is a phase-shifted version of the signal - as an imaginary part to the signal. Since its introduction, the complex signal has become an important tool in signal processing, with applications, for example, in narrowband communication. Different approaches to an n-D analytic or complex signal have been proposed in the past. We review these approaches and propose the hypercomplex signal as a novel extension of the complex signal to n-D. This extension leads to a new definition of local phase, which reveals information on the intrinsic dimensionality of the signal. The different approaches are unified by expressing all of them as combinations of the signal and its partial and total Hilbert transforms. Examples that clarify how the approaches differ in their definitions of local phase and amplitude are shown. An example is provided for the two-dimensional (2-D) hypercomplex signal, which shows how the novel phase concept can be used in texture segmentation.","citedby-count":"290","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60102562","afid":"60102562","affilname":"School of Engineering and Applied Science","affiliation-city":"Philadelphia","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012345","afid":"60012345","affilname":"Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel","affiliation-city":"Kiel","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55879295100","authid":"55879295100","authname":"Bülow T.","surname":"Bülow","given-name":"Thomas","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102562"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102542747","authid":"7102542747","authname":"Sommer G.","surname":"Sommer","given-name":"Gerald","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012345"}]}],"authkeywords":"Analytic signal | Clifford Fourier transform | Complex signal | Hilbert transform | Hypercomplex Fourier transform | Local amplitude | Local phase | Quaternionic Fourier transform","source-id":"17391","fund-acr":"DFG","fund-no":"So-320/2-1","fund-sponsor":"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035503273"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035503273?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0035503273&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0035503273&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035503273","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0035503273","eid":"2-s2.0-0035503273","dc:title":"Efficient implementation of quaternion Fourier transform, convolution, and correlation by 2-D complex FFT","dc:creator":"Pei S.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","prism:issn":"1053587X","prism:volume":"49","prism:issueIdentifier":"11","prism:pageRange":"2783-2797","prism:coverDate":"2001-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2001","prism:doi":"10.1109/78.960426","pii":"S1053587X01095964","dc:description":"The recently developed concepts of quaternion Fourier transform (QFT), quaternion convolution (QCV), and quaternion correlation, which are based on quaternion algebra, have been found to be useful for color image processing.

The conventional complex two-dimensional (2-D) Fourier transform (FT) is used to implement these quaternion operations very efficiently. By these algorithms, we only need two complex 2-D FTs to implement a QFT, six complex 2-D FTs to implement a one-side QCV or a quaternion correlation and 12 complex 2-D FTs to implement a two-side QCV, and the efficiency of these quaternion operations is much improved. Meanwhile, we also discuss two additional topics. The first one is about bow to use QFT and QCV for quaternion linear time-invariant (QLTI) system analysis. This topic is important for quaternion filter design and color image processing. Besides, we also develop the spectrum-product QCV. It is the improvement of the conventional form of QCV. For any arbitrary input functions, it always corresponds to the product operation in the frequency domain. It will be very useful for quaternion filter design.","citedby-count":"207","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005429","afid":"60005429","affilname":"National Taiwan University","affiliation-city":"Taipei","affiliation-country":"Taiwan"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000251","afid":"60000251","affilname":"IEEE","affiliation-city":"New York","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202463605","authid":"7202463605","authname":"Pei S.","surname":"Pei","given-name":"Soo Chang","initials":"S.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000251"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005429"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402608100","authid":"7402608100","authname":"Ding J.","surname":"Ding","given-name":"Jian Jiun","initials":"J.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005429"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7601548976","authid":"7601548976","authname":"Chang J.","surname":"Chang","given-name":"Ja Han","initials":"J.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005429"}]}],"authkeywords":"Quaternion convolution | Quaternion correlation | Quaternion Fourier transform","source-id":"17391","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035125985"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035125985?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0035125985&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0035125985&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035125985","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0035125985","eid":"2-s2.0-0035125985","dc:title":"Calibration of three-dimensional ultrasound images for image-guided radiation therapy","dc:creator":"Bouchet L.","prism:publicationName":"Physics in Medicine and Biology","prism:issn":"00319155","prism:volume":"46","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"559-577","prism:coverDate":"2001-02-22","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2001","prism:doi":"10.1088/0031-9155/46/2/321","pii":"S0031915501178747","dc:description":"A new technique of patient positioning for radiotherapy/radiosurgery of extracranial tumours using three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound images has been developed. The ultrasound probe position is tracked within the treatment room via infrared light emitting diodes (IRLEDs) attached to the probe. In order to retrieve the corresponding room position of the ultrasound image, we developed an initial ultrasound probe calibration technique for both 2D and 3D ultrasound systems. This technique is based on knowledge of points in both room and image coordinates. We first tested the performance of three algorithms in retrieving geometrical transformations using synthetic data with different noise levels. Closed form solution algorithms (singular value decomposition and Horn's quaternion algorithms) were shown to outperform the Hooke and Jeeves iterative algorithm in both speed and accuracy. Furthermore, these simulations show that for a random noise level of 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 mm, the number of points required for a transformation accuracy better than 1 mm is 25, 100, 200 and 500 points respectively. Finally, we verified the tracking accuracy of this system using a specially designed ultrasound phantom. Since ultrasound images have a high noise level, we designed an ultrasound phantom that provides a large number of points for the calibration. This tissue equivalent phantom is made of nylon wires, and its room position is optically tracked using IRLEDs. By obtaining multiple images through the nylon wires, the calibration technique uses an average of 300 points for 3D ultrasound volumes and 200 for 2D ultrasound images, and its stability is very good for both rotation (standard deviation: 0.4°) and translation (standard deviation: 0.3 mm) transformations. After this initial calibration procedure, the position of any voxel in the ultrasound image volume can be determined in world space, thereby allowing real-time image guidance of therapeutic procedures. Finally, the overall tracking accuracy of our 3D ultrasound image-guided positioning system was measured to be on average 0.2 mm, 0.9 mm and 0.6 mm for the AP, lateral and axial directions respectively.","citedby-count":"90","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60092971","afid":"60092971","affilname":"Medtronic Navigation, Colorado","affiliation-city":"Louisville","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024324","afid":"60024324","affilname":"University of Iowa","affiliation-city":"Iowa City","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013959","afid":"60013959","affilname":"University of Florida","affiliation-city":"Gainesville","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"pubmed-id":"11229734","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004568237","authid":"7004568237","authname":"Bouchet L.","surname":"Bouchet","given-name":"Lionel G.","initials":"L.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013959"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013959"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005870457","authid":"7005870457","authname":"Meeks S.","surname":"Meeks","given-name":"Sanford L.","initials":"S.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024324"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/18535213400","authid":"18535213400","authname":"Goodchild G.","surname":"Goodchild","given-name":"Gordon","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60092971"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005832041","authid":"7005832041","authname":"Bova F.","surname":"Bova","given-name":"Francis J.","initials":"F.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013959"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005676575","authid":"7005676575","authname":"Buatti J.","surname":"Buatti","given-name":"John M.","initials":"J.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024324"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35415104400","authid":"35415104400","authname":"Friedman W.","surname":"Friedman","given-name":"William A.","initials":"W.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013959"}]}],"source-id":"29203","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054091683"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054091683?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85054091683&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85054091683&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054091683","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85054091683","eid":"2-s2.0-85054091683","dc:title":"New 2D attributes based on complex and hypercomplex analytic signal","dc:creator":"Le Bihan N.","prism:publicationName":"2001 SEG Annual Meeting","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2001-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2001","dc:description":"We present new attributs derived from several new definitions of the 2D analytic signal and compare them.

The extended Kalman filter for the GPS/INS system provided better results with differential phase measurements than with quaternion measurements. Additional studies were carried out to improve the performance of the attitude determination. First, a cold-start initialization module using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was developed to overcome the limitation in the integer ambiguity resolution of the current onboard algorithm that the pitch and roll angles should be less than 15 deg for successful integer search. Second, GPS-based attitude determination with line bias modeling and multipath mitigation was performed to improve the performance to be as accurate as 0.06 deg (root mean square [RMS]) in three axes.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013372","afid":"60013372","affilname":"The University of Texas at Austin","affiliation-city":"Austin","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35756945900","authid":"35756945900","authname":"Um J.","surname":"Um","given-name":"Jaeyong","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013372"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55667013500","authid":"55667013500","authname":"Lightsey E.G.","surname":"Lightsey","given-name":"E.

For instance, in order to recognize a three dimentional object, we need specific features extracted from a given object. Then the features should be independent of the pose and the location of an object. To extract such features, the authors have presented the three dimensional vector autoregressive model (3D VAR model). This 3D VAR model is constructed on the quaternion, which is the basis of SU(2) (the rotation group in two dimensional complex space). This enables us to define the 3D VAR model as the external products of 3D sequential data and the autoregressive (AR) coefficients, unlike the usual AR models. Therefore the 3D VAR model has some prominent features. For example, the AR coefficients of the 3D VAR model behave like vectors under any three dimensional rotation. In this paper, the invariance from 3D VAR coefficients is given through the inner products of 3D VAR coefficients. With these invariants, we can categorize the three dimensional curves.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028263","afid":"60028263","affilname":"Saitama University","affiliation-city":"Saitama","affiliation-country":"Japan"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024621","afid":"60024621","affilname":"National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Tsukuba","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602444907","authid":"6602444907","authname":"Fujiki J.","surname":"Fujiki","given-name":"Jun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024621"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005705413","authid":"7005705413","authname":"Kiuchi Y.","surname":"Kiuchi","given-name":"Yasuhiko","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028263"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7408424726","authid":"7408424726","authname":"Tanaka M.","surname":"Tanaka","given-name":"Masaru","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028263"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102400388","authid":"7102400388","authname":"Mishima T.","surname":"Mishima","given-name":"Taketoshi","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028263"}]}],"authkeywords":"AR coefficients | AR model | Invariant | Vector AR coefficients | Vector AR model","source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035746770"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035746770?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0035746770&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0035746770&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035746770","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0035746770","eid":"2-s2.0-0035746770","dc:title":"Perceptual fuzzy multiscale color edge detection","dc:creator":"Vertan C.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","prism:issn":"10987584","prism:volume":"1","prism:pageRange":"19-22","prism:coverDate":"2001-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2001","prism:doi":"10.1109/FUZZ.2001.1007234","dc:description":"Color edge detection has been normally based on the vector extension of classical (scalar) derivative operators.

This paper proposes the use of the perceptually relevant dissimilarity measure, based on a fuzzy color model and on a spatial symmetry color spread index as the basis of a color edge detector.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003161","afid":"60003161","affilname":"University Politehnica of Bucharest","affiliation-city":"Bucharest","affiliation-country":"Romania"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/118142010","afid":"118142010","affilname":"University of Paitien","affiliation-city":"Bucharest","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603999152","authid":"6603999152","authname":"Vertan C.","surname":"Vertan","given-name":"C.","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003161"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"118142010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191201040","authid":"57191201040","authname":"Stoica A.","surname":"Stoica","given-name":"A.","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003161"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"118142010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55900445500","authid":"55900445500","authname":"Fernandez-Maloigne C.","surname":"Fernandez-Maloigne","given-name":"C.","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"118142010"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color edge detection | Color fuzzy model | Spatial symmetry color spread index","article-number":"6","source-id":"110565","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035168411"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035168411?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0035168411&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0035168411&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035168411","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0035168411","eid":"2-s2.0-0035168411","dc:title":"Color pattern recognition by quaternion correlation","dc:creator":"Pei S.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","prism:volume":"1","prism:pageRange":"894-897","prism:coverDate":"2001-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2001","dc:description":"It is popular to use the conventional correlation for pattern recognition. But when using the conventional correlation, the pattern should be gray-level pattern. In this paper, we will discuss how to use discrete quaternion correlation (DQCR) for the application of color pattern recognition. With the algorithm introduced here, we can detect the objects that have the same shape, color, and brightness with the reference pattern. Besides, we can also detect (a) the objects with the same shape, color, but different brightness, (b) the objects with the same shape, brightness, but different color, and (c) the objects just have the same shape as the reference. Our algorithm can classify the objects into 5 classes due to whether their shape, brightness, and color match those of the reference pattern. Besides, by our algorithm, the difference of brightness and color can also be calculated at the same time.","citedby-count":"24","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005429","afid":"60005429","affilname":"National Taiwan University","affiliation-city":"Taipei","affiliation-country":"Taiwan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202463605","authid":"7202463605","authname":"Pei S.","surname":"Pei","given-name":"S.

Using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) framework the scheme performs simultaneous corner feature tracking with correspondence analysis, and the reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) rigid objects. The paper introduces the concept of individual global rotation quaternions and translational offset vectors so that it is not necessary for all features associated with an object to be present in the first frame of the image sequence. Experiments on two image sequences containing a soccer ball and a model house show the potential and effectiveness of the scheme.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022020","afid":"60022020","affilname":"University of Warwick","affiliation-city":"Coventry","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602106809","authid":"6602106809","authname":"Cadman L.","surname":"Cadman","given-name":"L.","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022020"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55841380100","authid":"55841380100","authname":"Tjahjadi T.","surname":"Tjahjadi","given-name":"T.","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022020"}]}],"source-id":"92868","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035164796"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035164796?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0035164796&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0035164796&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0035164796","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0035164796","eid":"2-s2.0-0035164796","dc:title":"Hypercomplex Fourier transforms of color images","dc:creator":"Sangwine S.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","prism:volume":"1","prism:pageRange":"137-140","prism:coverDate":"2001-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2001","dc:description":"Hypercomplex Fourier transforms based on quaternions have been proposed by several groups for use in image processing, particularly of color images.

These systems employ either functional electrical stimulation or external power. It is proposed that, instead of time-consuming and complicated monitoring using sensors and motion analysis, a software simulator with both angular displacement and acceleration parameters can facilitate the design of a control strategy for an orthosis. Reaching movements of three cervical SCI subjects are used to verify the simulator. A motion analysis system is used to measure the range of motion and joint angles during hand reaching. Results indicate that quaternion and spline curve techniques are suitable for interpolation of the hand reaching movements. The information needed for good simulation only compress the shoulder and elbow joint angles in a few key postures. Stimulated acceleration signals on the upper-arm segment have a high correlation coefficient (>0.9) and a small root mean squared error (<0.11 g) with a real bi-axial accelerometer.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008928","afid":"60008928","affilname":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"}],"pubmed-id":"11523729","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35772793800","authid":"35772793800","authname":"Tong K.","surname":"Tong","given-name":"K.

The method first employs the traditional ICP criterion to establish a set of possible correspondences and then refine these correspondences using geometric constraints derived from properties of reflected correspondence vectors. In this way, the method overcomes a major limitation of the traditional ICP criterion which is the introduction of false matches in almost every iteration of the alignment. For an accurate estimation of the geometric parameters of interest, the Monte Carlo method is used in conjunction with a median filter. Finally, the quaternion method is used to estimate the motion parameters based on the refined correspondences. Experimental results based on both synthetic data and real images show that the proposed method can effectively align two overlapping range images with a small motion.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032204","afid":"60032204","affilname":"Sheffield Hallam University","affiliation-city":"Sheffield","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202521514","authid":"7202521514","authname":"Rodrigues M.A.","surname":"Rodrigues","given-name":"Marcos A.","initials":"M.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032204"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7410228990","authid":"7410228990","authname":"Liu Y.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Yonghuai","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032204"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36842194300","authid":"36842194300","authname":"Wei Q.","surname":"Wei","given-name":"Qian","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032204"}]}],"source-id":"110544","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
