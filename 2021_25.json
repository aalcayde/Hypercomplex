By generating new corresponding features in each iteration to recursively correct the estimated state, and keeping the system meet the quaternion constraint in calculation, the random error compensation filtering of gyroscope and accelerometer is realized.

Registration is essential if they are used in software systems. Existing automatic registration methods are either time-consuming or rough, and interactive registration methods are experience-dependent and tedious because of a great deal of purely manual interactions. For overcoming these disadvantages, a two-stage registration method is proposed. In the rough registration stage, the rough translation and rotation matrices are obtained by applying unit quaternion-based method on the points interactively selected from the two types of data. In the precise registration stage, the stridden sampling is used to reduce computational complexity and the proposed registration algorithm with scale transformation is used for precise registration. The proposed method offers a good trade-off between precision and time cost. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method provides faster convergence and smaller registration errors than existing methods.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60195520","afid":"60195520","affilname":"Tiangong University","affiliation-city":"Tianjin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57214891746","authid":"57214891746","orcid":"0000-0002-8279-2499","authname":"Yang S.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Shuai","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60195520"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57682475500","authid":"57682475500","authname":"Shi W.","surname":"Shi","given-name":"Wenjing","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60195520"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15831764400","authid":"15831764400","authname":"Ke Y.","surname":"Ke","given-name":"Yongzhen","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60195520"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219626731","authid":"57219626731","authname":"Xue Y.","surname":"Xue","given-name":"Yongjiang","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60195520"}]}],"authkeywords":"Data Sampling | Dental Computer-Aided Design System | Mesh Data | Two-Stage Registration | Volumetric Data","article-number":"29","source-id":"20100195036","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85118597520"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85118597520?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85118597520&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85118597520&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85118597520","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85118597520","eid":"2-s2.0-85118597520","dc:title":"Multi-focus image fusion method based on multi-scale decomposition of information complementary","dc:creator":"Wan H.","prism:publicationName":"Entropy","prism:eIssn":"10994300","prism:volume":"23","prism:issueIdentifier":"10","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"October 2021","prism:doi":"10.3390/e23101362","dc:description":"Multi-focus image fusion is an important method used to combine the focused parts from source multi-focus images into a single full-focus image. Currently, to address the problem of multifocus image fusion, the key is on how to accurately detect the focus regions, especially when the source images captured by cameras produce anisotropic blur and unregistration. This paper proposes a new multi-focus image fusion method based on the multi-scale decomposition of complementary information. Firstly, this method uses two groups of large-scale and small-scale decomposition schemes that are structurally complementary, to perform two-scale double-layer singular value decomposition of the image separately and obtain low-frequency and high-frequency components. Then, the low-frequency components are fused by a rule that integrates image local energy with edge energy. The high-frequency components are fused by the parameter-adaptive pulse-coupled neural network model (PA-PCNN), and according to the feature information contained in each decomposition layer of the high-frequency components, different detailed features are selected as the external stimulus input of the PA-PCNN. Finally, according to the two-scale decomposition of the source image that is structure complementary, and the fusion of high and low frequency components, two initial decision maps with complementary information are obtained. By refining the initial decision graph, the final fusion decision map is obtained to complete the image fusion. In addition, the proposed method is compared with 10 state-of-the-art approaches to verify its effectiveness. The experimental results show that the proposed method can more accurately distinguish the focused and non-focused areas in the case of image pre-registration and unregistration, and the subjective and objective evaluation indicators are slightly better than those of the existing methods.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020620","afid":"60020620","affilname":"Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010752","afid":"60010752","affilname":"Chongqing Normal University","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202321908","authid":"57202321908","authname":"Wan H.","surname":"Wan","given-name":"Hui","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010752"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23394027100","authid":"23394027100","authname":"Tang X.","surname":"Tang","given-name":"Xianlun","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55914596700","authid":"55914596700","authname":"Zhu Z.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Zhiqin","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36067507500","authid":"36067507500","authname":"Li W.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Weisheng","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]}],"authkeywords":"Joint bilateral filter | Multi-focus image fusion | Multi-scale decomposition | PA-PCNN | Quaternion | Singular value decomposition","article-number":"1362","source-id":"13715","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"KJ120611","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85116039104"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85116039104?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85116039104&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85116039104&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85116039104","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85116039104","eid":"2-s2.0-85116039104","dc:title":"Screen-shooting resilient watermarking scheme via learned invariant keypoints and QT","dc:creator":"Li L.","prism:publicationName":"Sensors","prism:issn":"14248220","prism:volume":"21","prism:issueIdentifier":"19","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"October-1 2021","prism:doi":"10.3390/s21196554","dc:description":"This paper proposes a screen-shooting resilient watermarking scheme via learned invariant keypoints and QT; that is, if the watermarked image is displayed on the screen and captured by a camera, the watermark can be still extracted from the photo. A screen-shooting resilient watermarking algorithm should meet the following two basic requirements: robust keypoints and a robust watermark algorithm. In our case, we embedded watermarks by combining the feature region filtering model to SuperPoint (FRFS) neural networks, quaternion discrete Fourier transform (QDFT), and tensor decomposition (TD). First we applied FRFS to locate the embedding feature regions which are decided by the keypoints that survive screen-shooting. Second, we structured watermark embedding regions centered at keypoints. Third, the watermarks were embedded by the QDFT and TD (QT) algorithm, which is robust for capturing process attacks. In a partial shooting scenario, the watermark is repeatedly embedded into different regions in an image to enhance robustness. Finally, we extracted the watermarks from at least one region at the extraction stage. The experimental results showed that the proposed scheme is very robust for camera shooting (including partial shooting) different shooting scenarios, and special attacks. Moreover, the efficient mechanism of screen-shooting resilient watermarking could have propietary protection and leak tracing applications.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013614","afid":"60013614","affilname":"Hangzhou Dianzi University","affiliation-city":"Hangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004879","afid":"60004879","affilname":"Feng Chia University","affiliation-city":"Taichung","affiliation-country":"Taiwan"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/117559214","afid":"117559214","affilname":"Key Laboratory of Brain Machine Collaborative Intelligence of Zhejiang Province","affiliation-city":"Hangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"34640870","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56179676100","authid":"56179676100","authname":"Li L.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Li","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013614"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57224316584","authid":"57224316584","authname":"Bai R.","surname":"Bai","given-name":"Rui","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013614"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"117559214"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16305895600","authid":"16305895600","authname":"Zhang S.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Shanqing","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013614"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191867957","authid":"57191867957","authname":"Chang C.C.","surname":"Chang","given-name":"Chin Chen","initials":"C.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004879"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57278979100","authid":"57278979100","authname":"Shi M.","surname":"Shi","given-name":"Mengtao","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013614"}]}],"authkeywords":"FRFS | Partial shooting | QT | Robustness | Screen-shooting","article-number":"6554","source-id":"130124","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"LGG19F020016","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85115999890"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85115999890?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85115999890&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85115999890&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85115999890","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85115999890","eid":"2-s2.0-85115999890","dc:title":"A novel zero watermarking based on dt‐cwt and quaternion for hdr image","dc:creator":"Huang J.","prism:publicationName":"Electronics (Switzerland)","prism:eIssn":"20799292","prism:volume":"10","prism:issueIdentifier":"19","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"October-1 2021","prism:doi":"10.3390/electronics10192385","dc:description":"This paper presents a high dynamic range (HDR) image zero watermarking method based on dual tree complex wavelet transform (DT‐CWT) and quaternion.

The HDR image provides a wide dynamic range, and thus, three‐color channel correlations are higher than inner‐relationships and the quaternion is used to consider three color channels as a whole to be transformed. Quaternion fast Fourier transform (QFFT) and quaternion singular value decomposition (QSVD) are utilized to decompose the HDR image for obtaining robust features, which is fused with a binary watermark to generate a zero watermark for copyright protection. Furthermore, the binary watermark is scrambled for the security by using the Arnold transform.

To improve the capability of resisting steganalysis algorithms, an image steganography scheme based on style transfer and quaternion exponent moments is proposed in this paper. First, the geometric invariance of quaternion exponent moments is combined to accomplish the task of embedding secret information. Next, the style transfer is performed on a stego image embedded with the secret information, and the stylized image is used to transmit through the common channel. Then, the receiver attempts to remove the style from the stylized image and to restore the stylized image back to its original appearance. For this purpose, a de-stylized network is designed to reconstruct the stego image from the stylized image. Finally, an extracting algorithm is used to extract the transmitted secret image from the reconstructed stego image. In the steganography process, the main goal is to achieve that even when the appearance and distribution of the carrier image have been changed, that should also look like an independent and normal behavior to an eavesdropper. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed scheme. Experimental and analysis results indicate that the proposed scheme can generate an independent and meaningful image and successfully transmit a secret image and has the ability to extract a secret image at a low bit error rate. In addition, the proposed scheme provides high security.","citedby-count":"23","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029322","afid":"60029322","affilname":"Dalian Maritime University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022904","afid":"60022904","affilname":"New Jersey Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Newark","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020464","afid":"60020464","affilname":"Guangxi Normal University","affiliation-city":"Guilin","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011592","afid":"60011592","affilname":"Qilu University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Jinan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204177824","authid":"57204177824","authname":"Li Q.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Qi","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029322"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9735589400","authid":"9735589400","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xingyuan","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029322"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020464"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204589541","authid":"57204589541","authname":"Ma B.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Bin","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011592"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201854908","authid":"57201854908","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiaoyu","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029322"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55318994100","authid":"55318994100","authname":"Wang C.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Chunpeng","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011592"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188991071","authid":"57188991071","authname":"Xia Z.","surname":"Xia","given-name":"Zhiqiu","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029322"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404964736","authid":"7404964736","authname":"Shi Y.","surname":"Shi","given-name":"Yunqing","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022904"}]}],"authkeywords":"De-stylized network | Image steganography | Quaternion exponent moments | Style transfer","article-number":"107618","source-id":"18136","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"MMJJ20170203","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85053054029"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85053054029?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85053054029&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85053054029&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0020025518306972"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85053054029","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85053054029","eid":"2-s2.0-85053054029","dc:title":"Quaternion lifting scheme applied to the classification of motion data","dc:creator":"Szczęsna A.","prism:publicationName":"Information Sciences","prism:issn":"00200255","prism:volume":"575","prism:pageRange":"732-746","prism:coverDate":"2021-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"October 2021","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.ins.2018.09.006","pii":"S0020025518306972","dc:description":"In this study, a new method of classification of skeleton-based motion data has been introduced. In the first stage, we performed multiscale feature extraction of rotational data. It is based on the proposed linear quaternion lifting scheme, with respect to the rotations coded by unit quaternions, which computes each scale based on the spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) prediction function and preserves the average signal value on each scale. Consequently, motion descriptors are extracted as quaternion attributes on different scales. The final recognition is performed by the nearest neighbor and minimum distance classifiers, adapted to support nonscalar features. Because of dimensionality of obtained descriptors, an attribute selection with respect to the multiresolution data has been proposed. It takes into consideration a specified number of resolutions, which is similar to low-pass filtering of the frequency domain. This method is utilized to solve the gait-based human identification problem. To validate such an application, a database containing data from 30 subjects was collected at the Human Motion Laboratory of the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology (PJAIT). The obtained results were found to be satisfactory.

In order to detect ship targets in optical satellite images under complex sea background, a salient ship detection algorithm based on multi-scale in frequency domain is proposed in this paper. In this method, we first use hypercomplex Fourier transform to get the amplitude matrix and phase matrix of the image and then use wavelet transform to calculate six saliency images of different scales in the frequency domain. And we use the evaluation function to select two best multi-scale saliency maps to generate the final saliency map by adaptive weight combination. Finally, the threshold is used to process the enhanced saliency map to locate the ship target. Experiments on relevant ship data show that the proposed method can improve the detection accuracy, detect ship targets of different sizes, effectively filter out wave clutter and noise, and is robust to sea clutter spots and heterogeneous sea areas.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028009","afid":"60028009","affilname":"Yunnan University","affiliation-city":"Kunming","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57346574400","authid":"57346574400","authname":"Ma Y.H.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Yu Hui","initials":"Y.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028009"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189632056","authid":"57189632056","authname":"Yu Y.","surname":"Yu","given-name":"Ying","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028009"}]}],"authkeywords":"hyper-Fourier transform | optical remote sensing images | ship detection | visual saliency","source-id":"21101066119","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61263048","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85116101339"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85116101339?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85116101339&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85116101339&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85116101339","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85116101339","eid":"2-s2.0-85116101339","dc:title":"Charged Bosons Made of Fermions in Bilayer Structures with Strong Metallic Screening","dc:creator":"Sun Z.","prism:publicationName":"Nano Letters","prism:issn":"15306984","prism:eIssn":"15306992","prism:volume":"21","prism:issueIdentifier":"18","prism:pageRange":"7669-7675","prism:coverDate":"2021-09-22","prism:coverDisplayDate":"22 September 2021","prism:doi":"10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c02422","dc:description":"Two-dimensional monolayer structures of transition metal dichalogenides (TMDs) have been shown to allow many higher-order excitonic bound states, including trions (charged excitons), biexcitons (excitonic molecules), and charged biexcitons.

A new relaxed 2DPCA under the quaternion framework is proposed to utilize the label (if known) and color information to compute the essential features of generalization ability with optimization algorithms. The 2DPCA-based approaches for face recognition are also improved by weighting each principle component a scatter measure, which increases efficiently the rate of face recognition. In numerical experiments on well-known standard databases, the R2DPCA approach has high generalization ability and achieves a higher recognition rate than the state-of-the-art 2DPCA-like methods, and has better performance than the basic deep learning methods such as CNNs, DBNs, and DNNs in the small-sample case.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60262990","afid":"60262990","affilname":"Qingdao Huanghai University","affiliation-city":"Qingdao","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60112903","afid":"60112903","affilname":"Baidu, Inc.","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073460","afid":"60073460","affilname":"China University of Mining and Technology","affiliation-city":"Xuzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004691","afid":"60004691","affilname":"Jiangsu Normal University","affiliation-city":"Xuzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16205704600","authid":"16205704600","authname":"Zhao M.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Meixiang","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073460"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004691"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8264355300","authid":"8264355300","authname":"Jia Z.","surname":"Jia","given-name":"Zhigang","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004691"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35112672300","authid":"35112672300","authname":"Cai Y.","surname":"Cai","given-name":"Yunfeng","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60112903"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56326174400","authid":"56326174400","authname":"Chen X.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Xiao","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60262990"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102687714","authid":"7102687714","authname":"Gong D.","surname":"Gong","given-name":"Dunwei","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073460"}]}],"authkeywords":"2DPCA | Face recognition | Feature extraction | Image reconstruction | Ridge regression model","source-id":"24807","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"PPZY2015A013","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85114420372"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85114420372?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85114420372&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85114420372&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85114420372","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85114420372","eid":"2-s2.0-85114420372","dc:title":"CT to MR registration of complex deformations in the knee joint through dual quaternion interpolation of rigid transforms","dc:creator":"Kuiper R.J.A.","prism:publicationName":"Physics in Medicine and Biology","prism:issn":"00319155","prism:eIssn":"13616560","prism:volume":"66","prism:issueIdentifier":"17","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-09-07","prism:coverDisplayDate":"7 September 2021","prism:doi":"10.1088/1361-6560/ac1769","dc:description":"Purpose. To develop a method that enables computed tomography (CT) to magnetic resonance (MR) image registration of complex deformations typically encountered in rotating joints such as the knee joint. Methods. We propose a workflow, denoted quaternion interpolated registration (QIR), consisting of three steps, which makes use of prior knowledge of tissue properties to initialise deformable registration. In the first step, the rigid skeletal components were individually registered. Next, the deformation of soft tissue was estimated using a dual quaternion-based interpolation method. In the final step, the registration was fine-tuned with a rigidity-constrained deformable registration step. The method was applied to paired, unregistered CT and MR images of the knee of 92 patients. It was compared to registration using B-Splines (BS) and B-Splines with a rigidity penalty (BSRP). Registration accuracy was evaluated using mutual information, and by calculating Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), mean absolute surface distance (MASD) and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95) on bone, and DSC on water and fat dominated tissue. To evaluate the rigidity of bone in the registration, the Jacobian determinant (JD) was calculated. Results. QIR achieved improved results with 0.93, 0.76 mm and 1.88 mm on the DSC, MASD and HD95 metrics on bone, compared to 0.87, 1.40 mm and 4.99 mm for method and 0.87, 1.40 mm and 3.56 mm for the BSRP method. The average DSC of water and fat was 0.77 and 0.86 for the QIR, 0.75 and 0.84 for BS and 0.74 and 0.84 for BSRP. Comparison of the median JD and median interquartile (IQR) ranges of the JD indicated that the QIR (1.00 median, 0.03 IQR) resulted in higher rigidity in the rigid skeletal tissues compared to the BS (0.98 median, 0.19 IQR) and BSRP (1.00 median, 0.05 IQR) methods. Conclusion. This study showed that QIR could improve the outcome of complex registration problems, encountered in joints involving rigid and non-rigid bodies such as occur in the knee, as compared to a conventional registration approach.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true",

The condition giving rise to the equal relation of the derived result is obtained as well. The novel UP with covariance can be regarded as one in a tighter form related to the QLCT.

It is important that the stabilization works for different camera types, i.e., different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum independently of the weather conditions and any form of image dis-tortion. In this paper, we propose a method for real-time video stabilization that uses only gyroscope measurements, analyze its performance, and implement and validate it on a real-world professional electro-optical system developed at Vlatacom Institute. Camera movements are modeled with 3D rotations obtained by integration of MEMS gyroscope measurements. The 3D orientation estimation quality depends on the gyroscope characteristics; we provide a detailed discussion on the criteria for gyroscope selection in terms of the sensitivity, measurement noise, and drift stability. Further-more, we propose a method for improving the unwanted motion estimation quality using interpo-lation in the quaternion domain. We also propose practical solutions for eliminating disturbances originating from gyro bias instability and noise. In order to evaluate the quality of our solution, we compared the performance of our implementation with two feature-based digital stabilization methods. The general advantage of the proposed methods is its drastically lower computational complexity; hence, it can be implemented for a low price independent of the used electro-optical sensor system.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60276555","afid":"60276555","affilname":"School of Electrical Engineering","affiliation-city":"Belgrade","affiliation-country":"Serbia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60159725","afid":"60159725","affilname":"Vlatacom Research and Development Institute","affiliation-city":"Belgrade","affiliation-country":"Serbia"}],"pubmed-id":"34577426","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57258760200","authid":"57258760200","authname":"Milanović P.D.","surname":"Milanović","given-name":"Petar D.","initials":"P.D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60276555"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60159725"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55229395500","authid":"55229395500","authname":"Popadić I.V.","surname":"Popadić","given-name":"Ilija V.","initials":"I.V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60159725"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005342699","authid":"7005342699","authname":"Kovačević B.D.","surname":"Kovačević","given-name":"Branko D.","initials":"B.D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60276555"}]}],"authkeywords":"Electro-optical long-range surveillance systems | MEMS gyroscope | Video stabilization","article-number":"6219","source-id":"130124","fund-no":"157 VMSIS3_Advanced","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85114200225"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85114200225?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85114200225&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85114200225&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85114200225","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85114200225","eid":"2-s2.0-85114200225","dc:title":"Geometric algebra-based esprit algorithm for doa estimation","dc:creator":"Wang R.","prism:publicationName":"Sensors","prism:issn":"14248220","prism:volume":"21","prism:issueIdentifier":"17","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"September 2021","prism:doi":"10.3390/s21175933","dc:description":"Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation plays an important role in array signal processing, and the Estimating Signal Parameter via Rotational Invariance Techniques (ESPRIT) algorithm is one of the typical super resolution algorithms for direction finding in an electromagnetic vector-sensor (EMVS) array; however, existing ESPRIT algorithms treat the output of the EMVS array either as a “long vector”, which will inevitably lead to loss of the orthogonality of the signal components, or a quaternion matrix, which may result in some missing information. In this paper, we propose a novel ESPRIT algorithm based on Geometric Algebra (GA-ESPRIT) to estimate 2D-DOA with double parallel uniform linear arrays. The algorithm combines GA with the principle of ESPRIT, which models the multi-dimensional signals in a holistic way, and then the direction angles can be calculated by different GA matrix operations to keep the correlations among multiple components of the EMVS. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GA-ESPRIT algorithm is robust to model errors and achieves less time complexity and smaller memory requirements.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023813","afid":"60023813","affilname":"Shanghai University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022860","afid":"60022860","affilname":"National Space Science Center","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000937","afid":"60000937","affilname":"Shenzhen University","affiliation-city":"Shenzhen","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"34502830","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56193728100","authid":"56193728100","authname":"Wang R.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Rui","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58398485200","authid":"58398485200","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yue","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57207045394","authid":"57207045394","authname":"Li Y.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Yanping","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402082924","authid":"7402082924","authname":"Cao W.","surname":"Cao","given-name":"Wenming","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000937"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56493599300","authid":"56493599300","authname":"Yan Y.","surname":"Yan","given-name":"Yi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022860"}]}],"authkeywords":"Direction-of-arrival estimation | Electromagnetic vector-sensor array | ESPRIT algorithm | Geometric algebra","article-number":"5933","source-id":"130124","fund-acr":"NNSFC","fund-no":"JCYJ 20190808160815125","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85113323630"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85113323630?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85113323630&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85113323630&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85113323630","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85113323630","eid":"2-s2.0-85113323630","dc:title":"T-proper hypercomplex centralized fusion estimation for randomly multiple sensor delays systems with correlated noises","dc:creator":"Fernández-Alcalá R.M.","prism:publicationName":"Sensors","prism:issn":"14248220","prism:volume":"21","prism:issueIdentifier":"17","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 September 2021","prism:doi":"10.3390/s21175729","dc:description":"The centralized fusion estimation problem for discrete-time vectorial tessarine signals in multiple sensor stochastic systems with random one-step delays and correlated noises is analyzed under different T-properness conditions.

In this paper, we propose a no-reference stereoscopic image quality assessment (NR-SIQA) model using heterogeneous ensemble learning ‘quality-aware’ features from luminance image, chrominance image, disparity and cyclopean images via quaternion wavelet transform (QWT). Firstly, luminance image and chrominance image are generated by CIELAB color space as monocular perception, and the novel disparity and cyclopean images are utilized to complement with monocular information. Then, a number of ‘quality-aware’ features in the quaternion wavelet domain are discovered, including entropy, texture features, energy features, energy differences features and MSCN coefficients of high frequency sub-band. Finally, a heterogeneous ensemble model via support vector regression (SVR) & extreme learning machine (ELM) & random forest (RF) is proposed to predict quality score, and bootstrap sampling and rotated feature space are used to increase the diversity of data distribution. Comparing with the state-of-the-art NR-SIQA models, experimental results on four public databases prove the accuracy and robustness of the proposed model.","citedby-count":"13","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025785","afid":"60025785","affilname":"Shanghai Maritime University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/126752109","afid":"126752109","affilname":"Anhui Longquan Silicon Materials Co.,Ltd","affiliation-city":"Huaiyuan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57226841858","authid":"57226841858","authname":"Wang H.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Hui","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025785"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35435480300","authid":"35435480300","authname":"Li C.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Chaofeng","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025785"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57214808008","authid":"57214808008","authname":"Guan T.","surname":"Guan","given-name":"Tuxin","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025785"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57226837291","authid":"57226837291","authname":"Zhao S.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Shenghu","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"126752109"}]}],"authkeywords":"Feature extraction | Heterogeneous ensemble learning | Quaternion wavelet transform | Rotated feature space | Stereoscopic image quality assessment","article-number":"102058","source-id":"25061","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85112326862"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85112326862?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85112326862&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85112326862&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85112326862","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85112326862","eid":"2-s2.0-85112326862","dc:title":"Some applications of a decomposition for five quaternion matrices in control system and color image processing","dc:creator":"He Z.H.","prism:publicationName":"Computational and Applied Mathematics","prism:issn":"22383603","prism:eIssn":"18070302","prism:volume":"40","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"September 2021","prism:doi":"10.1007/s40314-021-01579-3","dc:description":"In this paper, some applications of a decomposition for five quaternion matrices in control system and color image processing are given.

A novel quaternion polar complex exponential transform (NoQPCET) was firstly constructed with effectively improved performance; then the NoQPCET and chaotic system based robust color image zero-watermarking algorithm was suggested for lossless copyright protection of color images. In the proposed algorithm, the robustness against geometric attacks was enhanced due to the excellent geometric invariance of NoQPCET, and the security was also improved because of the initial value sensitivity of the chaotic system. Experimental results showed that this algorithm had very strong robustness against both geometric attacks and common image processing attacks, and was superior to other algorithms.","citedby-count":"20","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029322","afid":"60029322","affilname":"Dalian Maritime University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013268","afid":"60013268","affilname":"Taiyuan University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Taiyuan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011592","afid":"60011592","affilname":"Qilu University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Jinan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188991071","authid":"57188991071","authname":"Xia Z.","surname":"Xia","given-name":"Zhiqiu","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029322"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011592"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011592"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9735589400","authid":"9735589400","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xingyuan","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029322"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011592"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011592"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55318994100","authid":"55318994100","orcid":"0000-0002-3742-5614","authname":"Wang C.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Chunpeng","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011592"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011592"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204589541","authid":"57204589541","authname":"Ma B.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Bin","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011592"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011592"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209296515","authid":"57209296515","authname":"Zhang H.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Hao","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013268"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204177824","authid":"57204177824","authname":"Li Q.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Qi","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029322"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011592"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011592"}]}],"authkeywords":"Geometric attacks | Hénon map | Novel quaternion polar complex exponential transform | Zero-watermarking","article-number":"103130","source-id":"24306","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"MMJJ20170203","fund-sponsor":"Department of Science and Technology of Shandong Province","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85106193344"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85106193344?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85106193344&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85106193344&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85106193344","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85106193344","eid":"2-s2.0-85106193344","dc:title":"Discrete uncertainty principle in quaternion setting and application in signal reconstruction","dc:creator":"Yang Y.","prism:publicationName":"International Journal of Wavelets, Multiresolution and Information Processing","prism:issn":"02196913","prism:volume":"19","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2021-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 September 2021","prism:doi":"10.1142/S0219691321500193","dc:description":"In this paper, a novel discrete uncertainty principle associated with discrete Quaternion Fourier transform is established to give the relationship between the nonzero numbers of the discrete quaternion-valued signals and their Quaternion Fourier transforms.

In this work, we proposed a new parallel framework for fast computation of quaternion moments in Cartesian coordinates using multi-core CPUs and many-core graphics processing units (GPUs) with the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). We called the proposed unified computational framework “CUDAQuat.” This framework was tested by eleven sets of quaternion moments.

Hence, early detection and grading are important for its effective treatment. This study presents a comprehensive micro-macro feature extraction algorithm for the grading of DR using retinal images. The method employed is a mutliresolutional microtechnique, based on dual-tree quaternion wavelet transform fused with local mesh patterns. Since the pixel level model is unable to capture macrolevel features and is difficult for efficient decision-making, this process additionally proposes a macrolevel feature extraction technique based on feature gradients. The macrolevel descriptor considers a group of pixels to find feature gradients of macrolevel lesions. Feature extracted using the micro-macro approaches is summarized, and a comparison study using three machine learning classifiers is considered. Performance of the classifiers is determined by conducting a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. Among the classifiers, the highest classification accuracy of 93.2% is exhibited by radial basis function kernel extreme learning machine. Simulation results illustrate the adaptability and competency of the novel micro-macro approach with high accuracy and sensitivity.

From a virtual controller for the position dynamics, attitude and angular velocity references are estimated with the aim of allowing the position-control components to enforce the tracking of a position reference. In addition, no measurement of the linear velocity is assumed, and the measurement of the position signal is noisy, thus, a dynamic observer for the position dynamics is employed. The ellipsoid method is considered to estimate the feedback controller and observer gains, based on an optimization procedure, in order to produce the ultimately boundedness of attitude and position tracking errors inside a compact convex vicinity of the origin, whose Lebesgue measure is minimized via LMIs. The advantages of the proposed scheme are illustrated through numerical simulations that include aerodynamic disturbances and noisy measurements. Finally, an experimental assessment is carried out to illustrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed controller in a real-time application.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020547","afid":"60020547","affilname":"Texas A&amp;M University","affiliation-city":"College Station","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017323","afid":"60017323","affilname":"Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politécnico Nacional","affiliation-city":"Mexico","affiliation-country":"Mexico"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001422","afid":"60001422","affilname":"Sorbonne Université","affiliation-city":"Paris","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000981","afid":"60000981","affilname":"Centro para la Investigación Interdisciplinaria Avanzada en Ciencias de los Materiales","affiliation-city":"Santiago","affiliation-country":"Chile"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000795","afid":"60000795","affilname":"Universidad Autónoma del Carmen","affiliation-city":"Ciudad del Carmen","affiliation-country":"Mexico"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55489536900","authid":"55489536900","authname":"Oliva-Palomo F.","surname":"Oliva-Palomo","given-name":"Fátima","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000981"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23569744300","authid":"23569744300","authname":"Sanchez-Orta A.","surname":"Sanchez-Orta","given-name":"Anand","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017323"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35783869200","authid":"35783869200","authname":"Alazki H.","surname":"Alazki","given-name":"Hussain","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000795"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/47461061100","authid":"47461061100","authname":"Castillo P.","surname":"Castillo","given-name":"Pedro","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001422"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204699024","authid":"57204699024","authname":"Muñoz-Vázquez A.J.","surname":"Muñoz-Vázquez","given-name":"Aldo Jonathan","initials":"A.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020547"}]}],"authkeywords":"Position control | Quaternion control | Real-time validation | Unmanned aerial vehicle","article-number":"107721","source-id":"21080","fund-no":"264513","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}}]}}
