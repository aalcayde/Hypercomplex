We address the problems of spacecraft attitude determination. (AD) and FDI for sensors and actuators by developing (i) a nonlinear Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) which does not require a small angle approximation, (ii) a method for on-line tuning of noise covariances, and (iii) a Multi-Hypothesis Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) for detection and identification of sensor (gyro, star tracker) and actuator (thruster) failures. A nonlinear EKF is designed for AD using angular rates, quaternions and the gyro biases as state variables. It is shown to provide more accurate estimates of the attitude angles and can be used for the detection and removal of bad gyro and star-tracker measurements. The EKF is found to be robust against process noise used to represent disturbance modelling errors. The MEKF approach is used for the detection and identification of gyro, star-tracker and thruster failures. Gyro failures are the quickest to detect and identify, followed by thruster and star tracker failures.","citedby-count":"58","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030211","afid":"60030211","affilname":"Scientific Systems Company, Inc.","affiliation-city":"Woburn","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201915948","authid":"7201915948","authname":"Mehra R.","surname":"Mehra","given-name":"Raman","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030211"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602218057","authid":"6602218057","authname":"Seereeram S.","surname":"Seereeram","given-name":"Sanjeev","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030211"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004894166","authid":"7004894166","authname":"Bayard D.","surname":"Bayard","given-name":"David","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030211"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003474664","authid":"7003474664","authname":"Hadaegh F.","surname":"Hadaegh","given-name":"Fred","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030211"}]}],"source-id":"25434","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0029484271"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0029484271?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0029484271&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0029484271&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0029484271","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0029484271","eid":"2-s2.0-0029484271","dc:title":"Wavelets and multiresolution analysis on sphere-like surfaces","dc:creator":"Schmitt E.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","prism:issn":"0277786X","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"0819419281"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780819419286"}],"prism:volume":"2569","prism:issueIdentifier":"1/-","prism:pageRange":"92-101","prism:coverDate":"1995-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1995","dc:description":"We construct a multiresolution analysis and wavelets on the manifolds S 2 and SO(3).

The quadratic nature of this function is made possible by representing rotation and translation with a dual number quaternion. We provide a detailed account of the computational aspects of a trust-region optimization method. This method compares favourably with Newton's method which has extensively been used to solve the problem at hand, with Faugeras-Toscani's linear method (Faugeras and Toscani 1986) for calibrating a camera, and with the Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear optimization method.

Orientation and velocity selectivity and spatial-frequency characteristics of the excitatory zones of the same RF may differ between zones. The number of zones in RFs correlate with RF sizes: the more RF size the more zones number in them (r = 0.05, P < 0.02). About 66% of zones in RFs have approximately identical sizes (12-16 deg) and sizes those zones an dependence as from their number in RFs (r = 0.03, P > 0.05) as from the eccentricity (r = 0.3, P > 0.05). Zones in RF were distributed so that distance their centres was between 56-65 degrees (an average across all 60 degrees). If two or three zones were tested simultaneously the neuron changed own frequency and orientation tuning. Consequently the functional organization of neural RFs of prestriate cortex depend upon number simultaneously tested zones in spatial information processing. Was shown that important properties of prestriate cortex neurons is their ability to integrate and complex processing of spatial information across wide area of the visual field; in the prestriate cortex thus violate of straight retinotopical representation principle of visual field, characteristics of all investigated areas of visual system.

The vehicle’s attitude determination subsystem consisted of a simple fixed-gain Kalman filter, uncoupled about each spacecraft axis, combining rate inputs from either a fiber optic gyro or a ring-laser gyro and attitude inputs from two star trackers. The filter provided estimates of the attitude inputs quaternion and the gvro biases about each axis. The attitude control subsystem consisted of a simple PID-based algorithm operating on quaternion and rate feedback signals to provide pointing, tracking, and slewing function. The primary actuating devices were three orthogonally-aligned reaction wheels used for feedback error compensation and twelve thrusters used for occasional momentum dumping. During lunar mapping the attitude control subsystem maintained vehicle pointing to within a three-axis RSS value of 0.05 degrees. An on-orbit spacecraft inertia estimator was also successfully tested using two separate slew maneuvers.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027271","afid":"60027271","affilname":"Naval Research Laboratory","affiliation-city":"Washington, D.C.","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100318396","afid":"100318396","affilname":"Swales and Associates, Inc.","affiliation-city":"Beltsville","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603915897","authid":"6603915897","authname":"Creamer G.","surname":"Creamer","given-name":"Glenn","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"100318396"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603593247","authid":"6603593247","authname":"DeLahunt P.","surname":"DeLahunt","given-name":"Paul","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027271"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7103135163","authid":"7103135163","authname":"Gates S.","surname":"Gates","given-name":"Steve","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027271"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006626865","authid":"7006626865","authname":"Levenson M.","surname":"Levenson","given-name":"Mary","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027271"}]}],"source-id":"21100448041","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77957199003"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77957199003?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77957199003&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77957199003&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1076567008701435"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77957199003","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:77957199003","eid":"2-s2.0-77957199003","dc:title":"Group Algebras in Signal and Image Processing","dc:creator":"Wenzel D.","prism:publicationName":"Advances in Imaging and Electron Physics","prism:issn":"10765670","prism:volume":"94","prism:issueIdentifier":"C","prism:pageRange":"1-79","prism:coverDate":"1995-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 January 1995","prism:doi":"10.1016/S1076-5670(08)70143-5","pii":"S1076567008701435","dc:description":"The linear and cyclic convolutions are computed as polynomial products. Group algebras are generalizations of polynomials and polynomial arithmetic based on algebraic groups. The multiplication in group algebra is called “group convolution.” The selection of coefficients from the cyclic convolution to generate output for the linear convolution can be extended to other functions called “value functions,” to allow for a wider variety of outputs. Group convolution of a signal requires selecting a single base group to work with. For images, group convolution is naturally based on the direct product of groups. Matrix representation of group algebra elements is discussed. The chapter discusses direct product group algebras. The ideas extend to convolution of data sets whose dimension is larger than two. Semidirect product group algebras that are used mainly in studying group algebras based on dihedral groups are discussed. The chapter also discusses inverting group algebra elements. Two methods for inverting elements are explained. In applications where nonzero and noninvertible group algebra elements may be a problem, a way to eliminate these elements via ideals and quotient rings is presented. Matrices whose elements are from group algebra are discussed. The chapter focuses on those matrices that have the convolution property—that is, those matrices for which the transform of a convolution is the product of the individual transforms. The chapter presents examples of the application of group algebras to edge detection in signals and images. The examples illustrate the use of direct product cyclic groups (the standard convolution case), direct product dihedral groups, and direct product quaternions. The chapter describes the process to implement group algebras in an object-oriented programming language. © 1995, Academic Press Inc.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025111","afid":"60025111","affilname":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","affiliation-city":"Chapel Hill","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/109554265","afid":"109554265","affilname":"Phototelesis Corporation","affiliation-city":"San Antonio","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206162620","authid":"57206162620","authname":"Wenzel D.","surname":"Wenzel","given-name":"Dennis","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"109554265"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701746342","authid":"6701746342","authname":"Eberly D.","surname":"Eberly","given-name":"David","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025111"}]}],"source-id":"18677","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0029569055"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0029569055?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0029569055&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0029569055&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-0893608095000798"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0029569055","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0029569055","eid":"2-s2.0-0029569055","dc:title":"Synthetic aperture radar processing by a multiple scale neural system for boundary and surface representation","dc:creator":"Grossberg S.","prism:publicationName":"Neural Networks","prism:issn":"08936080","prism:volume":"8","prism:issueIdentifier":"7-8","prism:pageRange":"1005-1028","prism:coverDate":"1995-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1995","prism:doi":"10.1016/0893-6080(95)00079-8","pii":"0893608095000798","dc:description":"A neural network model of boundary segmentation and surface representation is developed to process images containing range data gathered by a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor. The boundary and surface processing are accomplished by an improved Boundary Countour System (BCS) and Feature Countour System (FCS), respectively, that have been derived from analyses of perceptual and neurobiological data. BCS/FCS processing makes structures such as motor vehicles, roads, and buildings more salient and interpretable to human observers than they are in the original imagery. Early processing by ON cells and OFF cells embedded in shunting center-surround network models preprocessing by lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Such preprocessing compensates for illumination gradients, normalizes input dynamic range, and extracts local ratio contrasts. ON cell and OFF cell outputs are combined in the BCS to define oriental filters that model corticla simple cells. Pooling ON and OFF outputs at simple cells overcomes complementary processing deficiencies of each cell type along concave and convex contours, and enhances simpl;e cell sensitivity to image edges. Oriented filter outputs are rectified and outputs sensitive to opposite contrast polarities are pooled to define complex cells. The complex cells output to stages of short-range spatial competition (or endstopping) and orientational competition among hypercomplex cells. Hypercomplex cells activate long-range cooperative bipole cells that begin to group image boundaries. Nonlinear feedback between bipole cells and hypercomplex cell segments image regions by cooperatively completing and regularizing the most favored boundaries while suppressing image noise and weaker boundary groupings. Boundary segmentation is performed by three copies of the BCS at small, medium, and large filter scales, whose subsequent interaction distances covary with the size of the filter. Filling-in of multiple surface representations occurs within the FCS at each scale via a boundary-gated diffusion process. Diffusion is activated by the normalized LGN ON and OFF outputs within ON and OFFfilling-in domains. Diffusion is restricted to the regions defined by gating signals from the corresponding BCS boundary segmentation. The filled-in opponent ON and OFFsignals are subtracted to form double opponent surface representations. These surface representations are shown by any of three methods to be sensitive to both image ratio contrasts and background luminance. The three scales of surface representation are then added to yield a final multiple-scale output. The BCS and FCS are shown to perform favorably in comparison to several other techniques for speckle removal. © 1995.","citedby-count":"85","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019674","afid":"60019674","affilname":"Boston University","affiliation-city":"Boston","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101773583","authid":"7101773583","authname":"Grossberg S.","surname":"Grossberg","given-name":"Stephen","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019674"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004293916","authid":"7004293916","authname":"Mingolla E.","surname":"Mingolla","given-name":"Ennio","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019674"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/37076300900","authid":"37076300900","authname":"Williamson J.","surname":"Williamson","given-name":"James","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019674"}]}],"authkeywords":"BCS | Boundary segmentation | FCS | Neural network | Surface representation | Synthetic aperture radar","source-id":"24804","fund-acr":"NSF","fund-no":"IRI-90-24877","fund-sponsor":"National Science Foundation","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherhybridgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Hybrid Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0029488185"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0029488185?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0029488185&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0029488185&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0029488185","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0029488185","eid":"2-s2.0-0029488185","dc:title":"Planar motion synthesis using an approximate bi-invariant metric","dc:creator":"Larochelle P.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Mechanical Design, Transactions of the ASME","prism:issn":"10500472","prism:volume":"117","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"646-650","prism:coverDate":"1995-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 1995","prism:doi":"10.1115/1.2826735","dc:description":"In this paper we present a technique for using a bi-invariant metric in the image space of spherical displacements for designing planar mechanisms for n (> 5) position rigid body guidance.

The pushbroom satellite resection problem is significantly more complicated than that of the conventional frame camera because of irregular platform motion throughout the image capture period. Enough ephemeris data are typically available to reconstruct satellite trajectory and hence the interior orientation of the pushbroom imagery. The new approach to resection relies on the use of reconstructed scanner interior orientation to determine the relative orientations of a bundle of image rays. The absolute position and orientation which allows this bundle to minimize its distance from a corresponding set of ground control points may then be found. The interior orientation is represented as a kinematic chain of screw motions, implemented as dual-number quaternions. The motor algebra is used in the analysis since it provides a means of line, point, and motion manipulation. Its moment operator provides a metric of distance between the image ray and the ground control point.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011149","afid":"60011149","affilname":"Trinity College Dublin","affiliation-city":"Dublin","affiliation-country":"Ireland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603016809","authid":"6603016809","authname":"Shevlin F.","surname":"Shevlin","given-name":"Fergal P.","initials":"F.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011149"}]}],"source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
