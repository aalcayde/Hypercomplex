Recently, however, with the re-emergence of color-based stereo and volumetric techniques, and the extensive use of color microscopy, color imaging for PIV has again become relevant. In this work, we explore the potential advantages of color PIV processing by developing and proposing new methods for handling multi-color images. The first method uses cross-correlation of every color channel independently to build a color vector cross-correlation plane. The vector cross-correlation can then be searched for one or more peaks corresponding to either the average displacement of several flow components using a color ensemble operation, or for the individual motion of colored particles, each with a different behavior. In the latter case, linear unmixing is used on the correlation plane to separate each known particle type as captured by the different color channels. The second method introduces the use of quaternions to encode the color data, and the cross-correlation is carried out simultaneously on all colors. The resulting correlation plane can be searched either for a single peak, corresponding to the mean flow or for multiple peaks, with velocity phase separation to determine which velocity corresponds to which particle type. Each of these methods was tested using synthetic images simulating the color recording of noisy particle fields both with and without the use of a Bayer filter and demosaicing operation. It was determined that for single-phase flow, both color methods decreased random errors by approximately a factor of two due to the noise signal being uncorrelated between color channels, while maintaining similar bias errors as compared to traditional monochrome PIV processing. In multi-component flows, the color vector correlation technique was able to successfully resolve displacements of two distinct yet coupled flow components with errors similar to traditional grayscale PIV processing of a single phase. It should be noted that traditional PIV processing is bound to fail entirely under such processing conditions. In contrast, the quaternion methods frequently failed to properly identify the correct velocity and phase and showed significant cross talk in the measurements between particle types. Finally, the color vector method was applied to experimental color images of a microchannel designed for contactless dielectrophoresis particle separation, and good results were obtained for both instantaneous and ensemble PIV processing. However, in both the synthetic color images that were generated using a Bayer filter and the experimental data, a significant peak-locking effect with a period of two pixels was observed. This effect is attributed to the inherent architecture of the Bayer filter. In order to mitigate this detrimental artifact, it is suggested that improved image interpolation or demosaicing algorithms tuned for use in PIV be developed and applied on the color images before processing, or that cameras that do not use a Bayer filter and therefore do not require a demosaicing algorithm be used for color PIV.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027090","afid":"60027090","affilname":"Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University","affiliation-city":"Blacksburg","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009254","afid":"60009254","affilname":"Purdue University","affiliation-city":"West Lafayette","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006164","afid":"60006164","affilname":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","affiliation-city":"Los Alamos","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7801470906","authid":"7801470906","authname":"Charonko J.J.","surname":"Charonko","given-name":"John J.","initials":"J.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006164"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56020702700","authid":"56020702700","authname":"Antoine E.","surname":"Antoine","given-name":"Elizabeth","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027090"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003275087","authid":"7003275087","authname":"Vlachos P.P.","surname":"Vlachos","given-name":"Pavlos P.","initials":"P.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009254"}]}],"source-id":"130141","fund-acr":"NSF","fund-no":"IDBR 1152304","fund-sponsor":"National Science Foundation","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84919656978"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84919656978?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84919656978&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84919656978&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84919656978","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84919656978","eid":"2-s2.0-84919656978","dc:title":"GPS-based attitude determination for a spinning rocket","dc:creator":"Chiang K.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","prism:issn":"00189251","prism:volume":"50","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"2654-2663","prism:coverDate":"2014-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2014","prism:doi":"10.1109/TAES.2014.120822","dc:description":"An algorithm is developed for determining the attitude of a spinning sounding rocket. This algorithm is able to track global positioning system (GPS) signals with intermittent availability but with enough accuracy to yield phase observables for the precise, three-axis attitude determination of a nutating rocket. Raw, single-frequency GPS RF front-end data are processed by several filters to accomplish this task. First, a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) estimates GPS observables for multiple satellites by performing a least-squares fit to the accumulation outputs of a bank of correlators. These observables are then used as measurements in a Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother that optimizes estimates of carrier phase, Doppler shift, and code phase. Finally, attitude determination is carried out by another batch filter that uses the single-differenced optimized carrier phase estimates between two antennas and an Euler dynamics model for the torque-free attitude motion of the spinning rocket. This second batch filter implements a combination of a substantially modified form of the LMA and the least-squares ambiguity decorrelation adjustment (LAMBDA) method. This design enables it to deal with integer ambiguities that change over long data gaps between times of carrier phase availability. The algorithm presented in this paper is applied to recorded RF data from a spinning sounding rocket mission to produce attitude quaternion and spin-rate estimates using a pair of antennas separated by a 0.3-m baseline. These results are confirmed by another set of quaternions and spin-rate vectors independently estimated from magnetometer and horizon crossing indicator data. Attitude precision on the order of several degrees has been demonstrated.","citedby-count":"22","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104946","afid":"60104946","affilname":"Cornell University College of Engineering","affiliation-city":"Ithaca","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/43760993900","authid":"43760993900","authname":"Chiang K.","surname":"Chiang","given-name":"Karen","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104946"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004139057","authid":"7004139057","authname":"Psiaki M.","surname":"Psiaki","given-name":"Mark","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104946"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57210837411","authid":"57210837411","authname":"Powell S.","surname":"Powell","given-name":"Steven","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104946"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55415882200","authid":"55415882200","authname":"Miceli R.","surname":"Miceli","given-name":"Robert","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104946"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/30967608400","authid":"30967608400","authname":"O'Hanlon B.","surname":"O'Hanlon","given-name":"Brady","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104946"}]}],"authkeywords":"Doppler shift | Global positioning system | Mathematical model | Position measurement | Receivers | Rockets | Vectors","article-number":"6978869","source-id":"17336","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84907574940"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84907574940?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84907574940&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84907574940&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84907574940","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84907574940","eid":"2-s2.0-84907574940","dc:title":"Removing Gaussian noise for colour images by quaternion representation and optimisation of weights in non-local means filter","dc:creator":"Chen B.","prism:publicationName":"IET Image Processing","prism:issn":"17519659","prism:volume":"8","prism:issueIdentifier":"10","prism:pageRange":"591-600","prism:coverDate":"2014-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2014","prism:doi":"10.1049/iet-ipr.2013.0521","dc:description":"In this study, a new quaternion filter for removal of Gaussian noise in colour images is presented.

Classifying a structure as directional or nondirectional requires a measure to quantify the degree of directionality and a threshold, which needs to be chosen based on the statistics of the image. In order to do this, we model the image as a random field. So far, little research has been performed on analyzing directionality in random fields. In this paper, we propose a measure to quantify the degree of directionality based on the random monogenic signal, which enables a unique decomposition of a 2-D signal into local amplitude, local orientation, and local phase. We investigate the second-order statistical properties of the monogenic signal for isotropic, anisotropic, and unidirectional random fields. We analyze our measure of directionality for finite-size sample images and determine a threshold to distinguish between unidirectional and nonunidirectional random fields, which allows the automatic classification of images.","citedby-count":"14","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022148","afid":"60022148","affilname":"University College London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020238","afid":"60020238","affilname":"Universität Paderborn","affiliation-city":"Paderborn","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6507545514","authid":"6507545514","authname":"Olhede S.C.","surname":"Olhede","given-name":"Sofia Charlotta","initials":"S.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022148"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192768373","authid":"57192768373","authname":"Ramírez D.","surname":"Ramírez","given-name":"David","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020238"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102970468","authid":"7102970468","authname":"Schreier P.J.","surname":"Schreier","given-name":"Peter J.","initials":"P.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020238"}]}],"authkeywords":"Anisotropy | monogenic signal | quaternions | Riesz transform | stationary random field | unidirectional","article-number":"6863690","source-id":"15107","fund-acr":"EPSRC","fund-no":"EP/I005250/1","fund-sponsor":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84907094585"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84907094585?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84907094585&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84907094585&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84907094585","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84907094585","eid":"2-s2.0-84907094585","dc:title":"Spatial color image processing using Clifford algebras: application to color active contour","dc:creator":"Carré P.","prism:publicationName":"Signal, Image and Video Processing","prism:issn":"18631703","prism:eIssn":"18631711","prism:volume":"8","prism:issueIdentifier":"7","prism:pageRange":"1357-1372","prism:coverDate":"2014-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2014","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11760-012-0366-5","dc:description":"In the literature, the color information of the pixels of an image has been represented by different structures. Recently, algebraic entities such as quaternions or Clifford algebras have been used to perform image processing for example. This paper presents the embedding of color information into the vectorial parts of a multivector. This multivector is an element of the geometric or Clifford algebra constructed from a three-dimensional vector space. This formalism presents the advantage of algebraically separating colors which are handled entities from the geometric operations done to them. We propose to introduce several contributions for color image processing by using this Clifford algebra. First, as colors are represented by 1-vectors, we point out that a color pixel given in the RGB color space can be expressed algebraically by its hue saturation and value using the geometry. Then, we illustrate how this formalism can be used to define color alterations with algebraic operations. We generalize linear filtering algorithms already defined with quaternions and define a new color edge detector. Finally, the application of the new color gradient is illustrated by a new color formulation of snakes. Thus, we propose in this paper the definition and exploitation of a formalism in which we geometrically handle colors with algebraic entities and expressions.","citedby-count":"16","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032653","afid":"60032653","affilname":"Universite de Poitiers","affiliation-city":"Poitiers","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36008284700","authid":"36008284700","authname":"Carré P.","surname":"Carré","given-name":"Philippe","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032653"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15764750200","authid":"15764750200","authname":"Denis P.","surname":"Denis","given-name":"Patrice","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032653"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55900445500","authid":"55900445500","authname":"Fernandez-Maloigne C.","surname":"Fernandez-Maloigne","given-name":"Christine","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032653"}]}],"authkeywords":"Active contour | Clifford | Color edge detection | Color image processing | Geometric algebras | Multivectors","source-id":"6200180165","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85116176797"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85116176797?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85116176797&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85116176797&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85116176797","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85116176797","eid":"2-s2.0-85116176797","dc:title":"Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","prism:issn":"10636919","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781479951178"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781479951178"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2014-09-24","prism:coverDisplayDate":"24 September 2014","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 539 papers.

Quaternions avoid the degeneracies of other 3-D orientation representations, while the Bingham distribution allows tracking of large-error (high-entropy) rotational distributions. Experimental comparison to a leading EKF-based filtering approach on both synthetic signals and a ball-tracking dataset shows that the Quaternion Bingham Filter (QBF) has lower tracking error than the EKF, particularly when the state is highly dynamic.

The classic traffic sign detection methods adopted all kinds of visual features serial computation, failing to consider the interaction between various visual features, the detection precision need to be improved. Therefore, this paper proposed a novel multi-scale salient traffic sign video detection algorithm based on hypercomplex frequency domain. Firstly, hypercomplex vector is constructed by using the color visual and motion information of input video sequences.

Most existing methods usually extract features from the red, green, and blue color channels of images individually. They, however, neglect the connections between each color component in the image. To overcome this problem, a novel quaternionic local binary pattern (QLBP) is proposed for person reidentification in this paper. In the proposed QLBP, each pixel in a color image is represented by a quaternion so that we can handle all color components in a holistic way. A novel pseudo-rotation of quaternion (PRQ) is proposed to rank two quaternions. Some properties of PRQ are also discussed. After a QLBP coding, the local histograms are extracted and used as features. Experiments on two public benchmarking datasets, ETHZ and i-LIDS MCTS, are carried out to evaluate the QLBP performance. Comparison results show that the QLBP outperforms several stat-of-art methods for person reidentification.","citedby-count":"20","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35146229200","authid":"35146229200","authname":"Lan R.","surname":"Lan","given-name":"Rushi","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24175343600","authid":"24175343600","authname":"Zhou Y.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Yicong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404591899","authid":"7404591899","authname":"Tang Y.","surname":"Tang","given-name":"Yuan Yan","initials":"Y.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/47861886300","authid":"47861886300","authname":"Chen C.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"C.

The model (OFTPA-Optical Flow Topological Properties Attention) we proposed for motion attention saliency detection includes two stages. First stage focuses on extracting saliency features, including optical-flow velocity field, topological properties and Intensity, from video. The second integrates the traditional saliency features and an extra position prediction calculated from optical-flow field, to form bottom-up saliency maps which indicate where the object candidates are located. Spatiotemporal saliency maps are obtained from the phase spectrum of a video's hypercomplex Fourier transform.

However, different marginal components derived from various representations of a colour image will lead to different results of multivariate ordering. Moreover, the output of lexicographical ordering only depends on the first component leading to the followed components taking no effect. To address these issues, three new marginal components are obtained by means of quaternion decomposition, and they are employed by fuzzy lexicographical ordering, and thus a new fuzzy extremum estimation algorithm (FEEA) based on quaternion decomposition is proposed in this study. The novel multivariate mathematical morphological operators are also defined according to FEEA. Comparing with the existing solutions, experimental results show that the proposed FEEA performs better results on multivariate extremum estimation, and the presented multivariate mathematical operators can be easily handled and can provide better results on multivariate image filtering.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009806","afid":"60009806","affilname":"Lanzhou Jiaotong University","affiliation-city":"Lanzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003977","afid":"60003977","affilname":"Northwestern Polytechnical University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36602820500","authid":"36602820500","authname":"Lei T.","surname":"Lei","given-name":"Tao","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009806"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12763268500","authid":"12763268500","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205534899","authid":"57205534899","authname":"Wang G.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Guohua","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009806"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12782205200","authid":"12782205200","authname":"Fan Y.","surname":"Fan","given-name":"Yangyu","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]}],"source-id":"5400152646","fund-no":"61202314","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84901925894"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84901925894?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84901925894&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84901925894&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0167865514001470"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84901925894","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84901925894","eid":"2-s2.0-84901925894","dc:title":"Digital fingerprinting for color images based on the quaternion encryption scheme","dc:creator":"Czaplewski B.","prism:publicationName":"Pattern Recognition Letters","prism:issn":"01678655","prism:volume":"46","prism:pageRange":"11-19","prism:coverDate":"2014-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 September 2014","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.patrec.2014.05.001","pii":"S0167865514001470","dc:description":"In this paper we present a new quaternion-based encryption technique for color images. In the proposed encryption method, images are written as quaternions and are rotated in a three-dimensional space around another quaternion, which is an encryption key. The encryption process uses the cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. Further, this paper shows that our encryption algorithm enables digital fingerprinting as an additional feature. This feature follows from some artifacts which occur in the decrypted image. These artifacts can be maintained at such a low level that they remain imperceptible to the human eye and unique for each key. These artifacts are considered to be users' fingerprints and can be used to identify pirates in the event of illegal redistribution of multimedia data. Identification of pirates is performed in the form of non-blind detection. The purpose of this paper is to report a new approach to digital fingerprinting and to point out the method's existing flaws which need future research.

It is a challenging work to design a robust image watermarking scheme against desynchronization attacks, especially for color host images. In this paper, we propose a robust color image watermarking scheme based on local quaternion exponent moments. The proposed scheme has the following advantages: (1) the stable and uniform color image feature points are extracted by the new color image detector, in which the probability density gradient and color invariance model are used, (2) the affine invariant local feature regions are constructed adaptively according to the variation of local probability density and (3) the effective quaternion exponent moments are derived and introduced to embed watermark in the color image, which consider the correlation between different color channels. Experiments are carried out on a color image set of 100 images collected from Internet, and the preliminary results show that the proposed color image watermarking is not only invisible and robust against common image processing operations such as sharpening, noise adding, and JPEG compression, but also robust against the desynchronization attacks. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Aerial manipulation introduces modeling errors due to payload and parameter changes. When large external forces are applied, small helicopters must fly at orientations far outside hover conditions. The compensation of such uncertainties can be achieved through disturbance observation (DO). An onboard IMU makes the platform well-suited for acceleration-based DO. In this paper, we evaluate a cascaded attitude and position tracking controller for a quadrotor. Quaternions are used for attitude control to allow large orientation angles. We investigate attitude tracking by the boundary-layer integral sliding mode control coupled with acceleration-based DO. The position controller generates singularity-free quaternion and angular velocity signals. The presented controller is experimentally verified and compared to PID and backstepping controllers for trajectory tracking and hovering in turbulent conditions. Compensation of large external forces in the horizontal plane is shown through a stable 45° hover.","citedby-count":"28","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007798","afid":"60007798","affilname":"Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR)","affiliation-city":"Koln","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55348058600","authid":"55348058600","authname":"Tomic T.","surname":"Tomic","given-name":"Teodor","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007798"}]}],"article-number":"6862237","source-id":"21100348330","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84894098533"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84894098533?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84894098533&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84894098533&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84894098533","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84894098533","eid":"2-s2.0-84894098533","dc:title":"Central units of Integral group rings","dc:creator":"Jespers E.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society","prism:issn":"00029939","prism:eIssn":"10886826","prism:volume":"142","prism:issueIdentifier":"7","prism:pageRange":"2193-2209","prism:coverDate":"2014-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 July 2014","prism:doi":"10.1090/S0002-9939-2014-11958-7","dc:description":"We give an explicit description for a basis of a subgroup of finite index in the group of central units of the integral group ring ZG of a finite abelian-by-supersolvable group such that every cyclic subgroup of order not a divisor of 4 or 6 is subnormal in G. The basis elements turn out to be a natural product of conjugates of Bass units. This extends and generalizes a result of Jespers, Parmenter and Sehgal showing that the Bass units generate a subgroup of finite index in the center Z(U(ZG)) of the unit group U(ZG) in case G is a finite nilpotent group. Next, we give a new construction of units that generate a subgroup of finite index in Z(U(ZG)) for all finite strongly monomial groups G. We call these units generalized Bass units. Finally, we show that the commutator group U(ZG)/U(ZG)' and Z(U(ZG)) have the same rank if G is a finite group such that QG has no epimorphic image which is either a non-commutative division algebra other than a totally definite quaternion algebra or a two-by-two matrix algebra over a division algebra with center either the rationals or a quadratic imaginary extension of Q. This allows us to prove that in this case the natural images of the Bass units of ZG generate a subgroup of finite index in U(ZG)/U(ZG)'.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026810","afid":"60026810","affilname":"Vrije Universiteit Brussel","affiliation-city":"Brussels","affiliation-country":"Belgium"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024417","afid":"60024417","affilname":"Universitatea Babeș-Bolyai","affiliation-city":"Cluj Napoca","affiliation-country":"Romania"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000130","afid":"60000130","affilname":"Universidad de Murcia","affiliation-city":"Murcia","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003616433","authid":"7003616433","authname":"Jespers E.","surname":"Jespers","given-name":"Eric","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026810"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/22981212300","authid":"22981212300","authname":"Olteanu G.","surname":"Olteanu","given-name":"Gabriela","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024417"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005001527","authid":"7005001527","authname":"Del Río Á.","surname":"Del Río","given-name":"Ángel","initials":"Á.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000130"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36599364200","authid":"36599364200","authname":"Van Gelder I.","surname":"Van Gelder","given-name":"Inneke","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026810"}]}],"authkeywords":"Central unit | Generators | Group ring","source-id":"24677","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"},{"$" :"Green"}]}}]}}
