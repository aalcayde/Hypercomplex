Inspired by two existing saliency detection algorithms, named spectral residual (SR) and phase spectrum of quaternion Fourier transform (PQFT), we propose a new bottom-up saliency detection method which is featured with the introduction of hypercomplex spectral contrast (HSC) in saliency detection. The proposed HSC algorithm introduces the HSV color image vector space in hypercomplex number, and is better comprehensive to consider amplitude spectral contrast into saliency model as well as phase spectral contrast. Mean-while, we also incorporate the human vision nonuniform sampling into our model, which is a common phenomenon that directs visual attention to the logarithmic center of image in natural scenes. Experimental results on two public saliency detection datasets show that our approach performs better than four state-of-the art approaches remarkably.

The mother board is provided with a microcontroller and 9-axis inertial sensors (miniaturized MEMS accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer) to measure orientation. A quaternion-based extended Kalman filter (EKF) integrated with an R-Adaptive algorithm for automatic estimation of the measurement covariance matrix is implemented for the sensor fusion to retrieve the attitude.

A key issue in spectral clustering is how to build the affinity matrix. When it is applied to color image segmentation, most of the existing methods either use Euclidean metric to define the affinity matrix, or first converting color-images into gray-level images and then use the gray-level images to construct the affinity matrix (component-wise method). However, it is known that Euclidean distances can not represent the color differences well and the component-wise method does not consider the correlation between color channels. In this paper, we propose a new method to produce the affinity matrix, in which the color images are first represented in quaternion form and then the similarities between color pixels are measured by quaternion rotation (QR) mechanism.

However these spacecraft have a number of limitations compared to larger spacecraft: a tendency to tumble post-launch; lower computational power in relation to larger satellites and limited propulsion systems due to small payload capacity. As a result new methodologies for attitude control are required to meet the challenges associated with nano-spacecraft. This paper presents two novel attitude control methods to tackle two phases of a mission using zero-propellant (i) the detumbling post-launch and (ii) the repointing of nano-spacecraft. The first method consists of a time-delayed feedback control law which is applied to a magnetically actuated spacecraft and used for autonomous detumbling. The second uses geometric mechanics to construct zero propellant reference manoeuvres which are then tracked using quaternion feedback control. The problem of detumbling a magnetically actuated spacecraft in the first phase of a mission is conventionally tackled using BDOT control. This involves applying controls which are proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic field. However, real systems contain sensor noise which can lead to discontinuities in the signal and problems with computing the numerical derivative. This means that a noise filter must be used and this increases the computational overhead of the system. It is shown that a time-delayed feedback control law is advantageous as the use of a delayed signal rather than a derivative negates the need for such a filter, thus reducing computational overhead. The second phase of the mission is the repointing of the spacecraft to a desired target. Exploiting the analytic solutions of the angular velocities of a symmetric spacecraft and further using Lax pair integration it is possible to derive exact equations of the natural motions including the time evolution of the quaternions. It is shown that parametric optimisation of these solutions can be used to generate low torque reference motions that match prescribed boundary conditions on the initial and final configurations. Through numerical simulation it is shown that these references can be tracked using nano-spacecraft reaction wheels while eigenaxis rotations, used for comparison, are more torque intensive. As the method requires parameter optimisation as opposed to optimisation methods that require numerical integration, the computational effort is reduced.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/109031401","afid":"109031401","affilname":"Advanced Space Concepts Laboratory","affiliation-city":"Glasgow","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55318784100","authid":"55318784100","authname":"Maclean C.","surname":"Maclean","given-name":"Craig","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"109031401"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55318077700","authid":"55318077700","authname":"Pagnozzi D.","surname":"Pagnozzi","given-name":"Daniele","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"109031401"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101919171","authid":"7101919171","authname":"Biggs J.","surname":"Biggs","given-name":"James","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"109031401"}]}],"authkeywords":"Geometric control | Nano-spacecraft | Repointing | Time delay","source-id":"21100206003","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84863754209"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84863754209?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84863754209&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84863754209&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84863754209","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84863754209","eid":"2-s2.0-84863754209","dc:title":"Testing quaternion properness: Generalized likelihood ratios and locally most powerful invariants","dc:creator":"Vía J.","prism:publicationName":"European Signal Processing Conference","prism:issn":"22195491","prism:pageRange":"2064-2068","prism:coverDate":"2011-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2011","dc:description":"This paper considers the problem of determining whether a quaternion random vector is proper or not, which is an important problem because the structure of the optimal linear processing depends on the specific kind of properness.

However, when using a Kalman filter in this case, the measurements are vulnerable to dynamic accelerations which will result in substantial attitude estimation errors. The attitude acquisition method presented in this paper takes an attitude quaternion as system measurements and uses a Kalman filter to fuse signals from MEMS gyroscopes, accelerometers and magnetic sensors. In order to remove the influence of dynamic accelerations, when dynamic accelerations are found to be significant, a Quaternion-based Strapdown Navigation System (Q-SINS) algorithm is only applied without the Kalman filtering. When the dynamic accelerations are not significant, both the Q-SINS and the Bi-vector algorithms are utilized and fused using the Kalman filter for improved system performance. Compared with some other highly nonlinear and complicated attitude algorithms, the Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) proposed in this paper is computationally less expensive and more suitable for real-time applications.

The proposed method can handle hypercomplex number represented signals like color image. The hypercom-plex polar Fourier analysis is reversible that means it can be used to reconstruct image. The hypercomplex polar Fourier descriptor has rotation invariance property that can be used for feature extraction. Due to the noncommutative property of quaternion multiplication, both left-side and right-side hypercomplex polar Fourier analysis are discussed and their relationships are also established in this paper.

The proposed algorithm deals with two tasks on detecting traffic signs: auto-location and auto-extraction. Firstly, inspired by recent work of visual saliency detection, we obtain the location of traffic signs in a natural image by multi-scale phase spectrum of quaternion Fourier transformation (MSPQFT). Secondly, in order to extract traffic signs, auto-generated strokes are used instead of drawing the strokes by the users, the sign board area is extracted using automatic interactive image segmentation. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods remarkably in salient traffic sign detection. Moreover, the proposed detection method has higher accurate rate and robustness to different natural scenes. © 2011 IEEE.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025945","afid":"60025945","affilname":"Lanzhou University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Lanzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018308","afid":"60018308","affilname":"Xi'an Jiaotong University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36699960500","authid":"36699960500","authname":"Li C.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Ce","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025945"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018308"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56163129600","authid":"56163129600","authname":"Hu Y.","surname":"Hu","given-name":"Yaling","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025945"}]}],"authkeywords":"Image segmentation | Multiscale | Quaternion Fourier Transform(QFT) | Traffic sign detection | Visual saliency","article-number":"6100597","source-id":"19700183091","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84860630880"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84860630880?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84860630880&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84860630880&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84860630880","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84860630880","eid":"2-s2.0-84860630880","dc:title":"Fast colour vesselness","dc:creator":"Drew M.","prism:publicationName":"Final Program and Proceedings - IS and T/SID Color Imaging Conference","prism:issn":"10831304","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780892082971"}],"prism:pageRange":"146-151","prism:coverDate":"2011-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2011","dc:description":"Vesselness in an image is a map that conveys the extent to which certain image structures resemble blood vessels. The standard approach to this problem uses greyscale images. An earlier algorithm [1] derives a vesselness map for a colour image from the Hessian of a pure quaternion whose components are the colour channels. As an alternative to that method, we here divide the vesselness task into two parts: Convert the colour image to a grey image using the Fast Color2Grey algorithm [2, S]. and then use the traditional Frangi Hessian method [4] on that grey image to produce the vesselness map. Compared with the quaternion-based algorithm, the method proposed here is more accurate in identifying retinal blood vessels and also operates 10 4 times as fast. ©2011 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018491","afid":"60018491","affilname":"Simon Fraser University","affiliation-city":"Burnaby","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013141","afid":"60013141","affilname":"Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet","affiliation-city":"Trondheim","affiliation-country":"Norway"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100321381","afid":"100321381","affilname":"Datacolor","affiliation-city":"Lawrenceville","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201559514","authid":"7201559514","authname":"Drew M.","surname":"Drew","given-name":"Mark S.","initials":"M.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018491"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6506181411","authid":"6506181411","authname":"Alsam A.","surname":"Alsam","given-name":"Ali","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013141"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55208174600","authid":"55208174600","authname":"Madooei A.","surname":"Madooei","given-name":"Ali","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018491"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005504451","authid":"7005504451","authname":"Brill M.","surname":"Brill","given-name":"Michael H.","initials":"M.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"100321381"}]}],"source-id":"2300147403","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84860617050"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84860617050?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84860617050&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84860617050&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84860617050","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84860617050","eid":"2-s2.0-84860617050","dc:title":"Object recognition by combined invariants of orthogonal Fourier-Mellin moments","dc:creator":"Liu Q.","prism:publicationName":"ICICS 2011 - 8th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781457700309"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2011-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2011","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2011.6174265","dc:description":"Orthogonal moments are successfully used in the field of image analysis in the past decades.

For a person, an object that is red, it will be red regardless of the type of illumination source. However, for a computer algorithm to achieve the same task is not as simple. For vision and robotics applications were feature extraction is essential having such an algorithm is crucial. It is well known from the literature that the colour of an object does not only depend on the chemical composition and shape of its surface but also on the illumination conditions, the intensity, number, location and colour of the sources of illumination as well as the intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of the sensor used. Based on that knowledge, we propose a simple colour constancy algorithm that uses the quaternion representation of each pixel in the image instead of the commonly used RGB model. We assume linearity in the reception of the luminance spectrum of the charge-coupled device of the camera before variations in the illumination. We have tested our colour constancy algorithm in a variety of images containing different colour objects under different illumination conditions.

The goal is to align the image with the CAD model so that the location of various points in the image can be found on the object. We will actually present two methods for achieving this goal. One relies on projective invariants and requires no information about the camera parameters. Unfortunately, its performance is sometimes erratic in the face of particular types of errors. The other method assumes that the user is able to identify a minimum of 4 feature points in the image and the corresponding points on the CAD model. Beyond that, no information is assumed except for knowledge of the size of the camera's CCD and the location of the center of projection in the image. This second algorithm is highly accurate and robust in the face of real-world errors. We call this second algorithm the quaternion optimization algorithm.

This is achieved by maximizing a negentropy-based cost function, and is derived rigorously using the recently developed calculus in order to implement Newton optimization in the augmented quaternion statistics framework. It is shown that the use of augmented statistics and the associated widely linear modeling provides theoretical and practical advantages when dealing with general quaternion signals with noncircular (rotation-dependent) distributions.

This recent QWT is a near shift-invariant tight frame representation whose coefficients support a magnitude and three phases. These quaternion magnitude and phases are combined and extracted different scales LBP features. In this approach, a face image is modeled as a \"histogram equalization sequence\" by concatenating the histogram equalization of all the QWT magnitude/phase multi-scale LBP parts. For recognition, Chi-square distance is used to measure the similarity of different \"QWT multi-scale LBP histogram equalization sequences\" and the nearest neighborhood is exploited for final classification. The proposed approach is evaluated on the standard September 1996 FERET large-gallery image sets. Significant improvement in performance is observed. Compared with Gabor wavelet features, QWT magnitude/phase features are superior both on accuracy and computational complexity when the same classifier is used. Although EBGM has better rank-1 recognition rate in the probe set Fb, the proposed method is superior on other three probe sets. Moreover, the proposed method has few free parameters to adjust and has much lower computation complexity. © 2011 Binary Information Press December, 2011.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018465","afid":"60018465","affilname":"Yanshan University","affiliation-city":"Qinhuangdao","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23062484300","authid":"23062484300","authname":"Xu Y.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Yonghong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54585241400","authid":"54585241400","authname":"Hou J.","surname":"Hou","given-name":"Jing","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54794715200","authid":"54794715200","authname":"Zhao Y.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Yanru","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401528170","authid":"7401528170","authname":"Hong W.","surname":"Hong","given-name":"Wenxue","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018465"}]}],"authkeywords":"Face recognition | Histogram equalization | Magnitude/phase feature | Multi-scale local binary pattern | Quaternion wavelet transform","source-id":"145341","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
