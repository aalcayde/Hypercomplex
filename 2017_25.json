This paper aims to explore, in a systematic way, the corresponding ideas scattered and multiple-time re-invented in the literature, and introduces a unified approach in the same spirit as in [1], which relates LMS with the Kalman filter. The proposed alternative to the RLS is favored when the matrix inversion lemma is not useful, such as the case of multivariate or multichannel data where the input is not a vector. Furthermore, all the derivations are conducted in the quaternion domain and are hence generalizable to complex- and real-valued models. The resulting algorithm has a neat form and a similar complexity to the RLS. Through experiments, the method is shown to exhibit performance close to or even better than the RLS algorithm. Other aspects, such as the choice of descent directions and variable stepsizes, are also discussed to support the analysis.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015150","afid":"60015150","affilname":"Imperial College London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57200229987","authid":"57200229987","authname":"Variddhisaï T.","surname":"Variddhisaï","given-name":"Thiernithi","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006513328","authid":"7006513328","authname":"Mandic D.P.","surname":"Mandic","given-name":"Danilo P.","initials":"D.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]}],"authkeywords":"conjugate gradient | least mean square | Markov conjugate | Online predictor | quaternions | recursive least squares | steepest descent | widely linear model","article-number":"8096130","source-id":"21100846108","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85040352938"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85040352938?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85040352938&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85040352938&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85040352938","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85040352938","eid":"2-s2.0-85040352938","dc:title":"The quaternion least mean magnitude phase adaptive filtering algorithm","dc:creator":"Xiang M.","prism:publicationName":"International Conference on Digital Signal Processing, DSP","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538618950"}],"prism:volume":"2017-August","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2017-11-03","prism:coverDisplayDate":"3 November 2017","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.2017.8096079","dc:description":"Quaternion-valued adaptive filters based on the mean square error (MSE) criterion have been extensively studied in recent years.

The convergence analysis of the normalised version of the QLMMP employs a connection to the normalised QLMS with a quaternion-valued stepsize.

In order to solve this problem, a human body action recognition method is proposed based on quaternion spatial-temporal convolutional neural network (QST-CNN). Firstly, codebook algorithm is adopted to process all the images in the sample set and extract the key regions of human body motion in the images. Then, the quaternion matrix expression of the color images is taken as the input of the QST-CNN. The spatial convolutional layer of CNN is expended as a quaternion spatial convolutional layer. The values of the red, green, and blue channels of the color images are considered simultaneously as a whole in a spatial convolutional layer to conduct the extraction of the action spatial features, and avoid the loss of spatial relationships. The dynamical information of adjacent frames is extracted in a temporal convolutional layer. Finally, experiment was conducted, in which QST-CNN, gray single channel CNN (Gray-CNN) and RGB three channel CNN (3 Channel-CNN) were compared. The experiment result demonstrates that the QST-CNN boosts the performance of action recognition, the proposed method is superior to other popular methods and achieves the recognition rates of 85.34% and 80.2% in the Weizmann and UCF sports datasets, respectively.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073562","afid":"60073562","affilname":"Northeast Electric Power University","affiliation-city":"Jilin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55729910600","authid":"55729910600","authname":"Meng B.","surname":"Meng","given-name":"Bo","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073562"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201288572","authid":"57201288572","authname":"Liu X.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Xuejun","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073562"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57008295100","authid":"57008295100","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiaolin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073562"}]}],"authkeywords":"Codebook | Convolutional neural network (CNN) | Human body action recognition | Quaternion","source-id":"15597","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85040836601"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85040836601?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85040836601&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85040836601&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85040836601","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85040836601","eid":"2-s2.0-85040836601","dc:title":"Splicing Detection for Color Images Based on QDCT Markov method","dc:creator":"Wang J.W.","prism:publicationName":"Yingyong Kexue Xuebao/Journal of Applied Sciences","prism:issn":"02558297","prism:volume":"35","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"754-762","prism:coverDate":"2017-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2017","prism:doi":"10.3969/j.issn.0255-8297.2017.06.009","dc:description":"We propose a splicing detection scheme based on quaternion discrete cosine transform (QDCT).

By SDA, the position and orientation elements are determined jointly. To evaluate the robustness and efficiency of SDA, a group of progressive experiments were conducted on three types of datasets, including synthetic, close-range, and aerial images. Experimental results demonstrate that SDA overcomes the EOP correlation problems and achieves reliable positioning accuracies for large-angle oblique photographic structures.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073607","afid":"60073607","affilname":"Nanjing Xiaozhuang College","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143","afid":"60064143","affilname":"Nanjing University of Information Science &amp; Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021666","afid":"60021666","affilname":"Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36562635800","authid":"36562635800","authname":"Sheng Q.H.","surname":"Sheng","given-name":"Qing H.","initials":"Q.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195776959","authid":"57195776959","authname":"Zhang X.Y.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xin Y.","initials":"X.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021666"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56513027200","authid":"56513027200","authname":"Xiao H.","surname":"Xiao","given-name":"Hui","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073607"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/48260990900","authid":"48260990900","authname":"Guan H.Y.","surname":"Guan","given-name":"Hai Y.","initials":"H.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]}],"source-id":"12366","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"41471381","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85030859199"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85030859199?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85030859199&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85030859199&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1047320317301748"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85030859199","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85030859199","eid":"2-s2.0-85030859199","dc:title":"Quaternion pseudo-Zernike moments combining both of RGB information and depth information for color image splicing detection","dc:creator":"Chen B.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation","prism:issn":"10473203","prism:eIssn":"10959076","prism:volume":"49","prism:pageRange":"283-290","prism:coverDate":"2017-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2017","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jvcir.2017.08.011","pii":"S1047320317301748","dc:description":"The quaternion representation (QR) used in current quaternion-based color image processing creates redundancy when representing a color image of three components by a quaternion matrix having four components.

Using this improved QR, firstly we define the new quaternion pseudo-Zernike moments (NQPZMs) and then propose an efficient computational algorithm for NQPZMs through the conventional pseudo-Zernike moments (PZMs). Finally, we propose an algorithm for color image splicing detection based on the NQPZMs and the quaternion back-propagation neural network (QBPNN). Experimental results on four public datasets (DVMM, CASIA v1.0 and v2.0, Wild Web) demonstrate that the proposed splicing detection algorithm can achieve almost 100% accuracy with the appropriate feature dimensionality and outperforms 14 existing algorithms.

The QWT of an image consists of four parts, i.e., one magnitude part and three phase parts. The magnitude is nearly shift-invariant, which characterizes features at any spatial location, and the three phases represent the structure of these features. This indicates that QWT is more powerful in representing image structures, and thus is suitable for image quality evaluation. In this paper, an efficient and effective Camera Image Quality Metric (CIQM) is proposed based on QWT, which is utilized to describe the intrinsic structures of an image. For an image, it is first decomposed by QWT with three scales. Then, for each scale, the magnitude and entropy of the subband coefficients, and natural scene statistics of the third phase are calculated. The magnitude is utilized to describe the generalized spectral behavior, and the entropy is used to encode the generalized information of distortions. Since the third phase of QWT is considered to be texture feature, the natural scene statistics of the third phase of QWT is used to measure structure degradations in the proposed method. All these features reflect the self-similarity and independency of image content, which can effectively reflect image distortions. Finally, random forest is utilized to build the quality model.

In this paper, we address the issue of fine-tuning parameters of Deep Belief Networks by means of meta-heuristics in which real-valued decision variables are described by quaternions. Such approaches essentially perform optimization in fitness landscapes that are mapped to a different representation based on hypercomplex numbers that may generate smoother surfaces. We therefore can map the optimization process onto a new space representation that is more suitable to learning parameters. Also, we proposed two approaches based on Harmony Search and quaternions that outperform the state-of-the-art results obtained so far in three public datasets for the reconstruction of binary images.","citedby-count":"22","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014105","afid":"60014105","affilname":"Middlesex University","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006028","afid":"60006028","affilname":"Universidade Estadual Paulista \"Júlio de Mesquita Filho\"","affiliation-city":"Sao Paulo","affiliation-country":"Brazil"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23397842300","authid":"23397842300","orcid":"0000-0002-6494-7514","authname":"Papa J.P.","surname":"Papa","given-name":"João Paulo","initials":"J.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006028"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194616052","authid":"57194616052","authname":"Rosa G.H.","surname":"Rosa","given-name":"Gustavo H.","initials":"G.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006028"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/37041692000","authid":"37041692000","authname":"Pereira D.R.","surname":"Pereira","given-name":"Danillo R.","initials":"D.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006028"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35754063200","authid":"35754063200","authname":"Yang X.S.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Xin She","initials":"X.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014105"}]}],"authkeywords":"Deep Belief Networks | Harmony Search | Quaternion","source-id":"18136","fund-acr":"FAPESP","fund-no":"2014/12236-1","fund-sponsor":"Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85015089091"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85015089091?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85015089091&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85015089091&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85015089091","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85015089091","eid":"2-s2.0-85015089091","dc:title":"An inclusive immersion into a quaternionic manifold and its invariants","dc:creator":"Hasegawa K.","prism:publicationName":"Manuscripta Mathematica","prism:issn":"00252611","prism:volume":"154","prism:issueIdentifier":"3-4","prism:pageRange":"527-549","prism:coverDate":"2017-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 November 2017","prism:doi":"10.1007/s00229-017-0928-5","dc:description":"We introduce a quaternionic invariant for an inclusive immersion into a quaternionic manifold, which is a quaternionic object corresponding to the Willmore functional.

The magnetic field instrumentation consists of two independent magnetometer sensor suites, each consisting of a tri-axial Fluxgate Magnetometer (FGM) sensor and a pair of co-located imaging sensors mounted on an ultra-stable optical bench. The imaging system sensors are part of a subsystem that provides accurate attitude information (to ∼20 arcsec on a spinning spacecraft) near the point of measurement of the magnetic field. The two sensor suites are accommodated at 10 and 12 m from the body of the spacecraft on a 4 m long magnetometer boom affixed to the outer end of one of ’s three solar array assemblies. The magnetometer sensors are controlled by independent and functionally identical electronics boards within the magnetometer electronics package mounted inside Juno’s massive radiation shielded vault. The imaging sensors are controlled by a fully hardware redundant electronics package also mounted within the radiation vault. Each magnetometer sensor measures the vector magnetic field with 100 ppm absolute vector accuracy over a wide dynamic range (to 16 Gauss = 1.6 × 10 6nT per axis) with a resolution of ∼0.05 nT in the most sensitive dynamic range (±1600 nT per axis). Both magnetometers sample the magnetic field simultaneously at an intrinsic sample rate of 64 vector samples per second. The magnetic field instrumentation may be reconfigured in flight to meet unanticipated needs and is fully hardware redundant. The attitude determination system compares images with an on-board star catalog to provide attitude solutions (quaternions) at a rate of up to 4 solutions per second, and may be configured to acquire images of selected targets for science and engineering analysis. The system tracks and catalogs objects that pass through the imager field of view and also provides a continuous record of radiation exposure. A spacecraft magnetic control program was implemented to provide a magnetically clean environment for the magnetic sensors, and residual spacecraft fields and/or sensor offsets are monitored in flight taking advantage of Juno’s spin (nominally 2 rpm) to separate environmental fields from those that rotate with the spacecraft.","citedby-count":"185","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60111960","afid":"60111960","affilname":"ADNET Systems, Inc.","affiliation-city":"Bethesda","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011373","afid":"60011373","affilname":"Technical University of Denmark","affiliation-city":"Lyngby","affiliation-country":"Denmark"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009037","afid":"60009037","affilname":"Jet Propulsion Laboratory","affiliation-city":"Pasadena","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006337","afid":"60006337","affilname":"NASA Goddard Space Flight Center","affiliation-city":"Greenbelt","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/118468842","afid":"118468842","affilname":"Space Research Corporation","affiliation-city":"Annapolis","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/115352514","afid":"115352514","affilname":"Rocket Science Inc.","affiliation-city":null,"affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"re","subtypeDescription":"Review","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "16", "$" :"16"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003973851","authid":"7003973851","orcid":"0000-0001-7478-6462","authname":"Connerney J.E.P.","surname":"Connerney","given-name":"J.

Compared with Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Contourlet Wavelet Transform (CWT), QWT produces the parameters, i.e., one magnitude and three angles, which provide more valuable information to distinguish photographic (PG) images and computer generated (CG) images. Some theoretical analysis are done and comparative experiments are made. The corresponding results show that the proposed scheme achieves 18 percents’ improvements on the detection accuracy than Farid’s scheme and 12 percents than Özparlak’s scheme. It may be the first time to introduce QWT to image forensics, but the improvements are encouraging.","citedby-count":"119","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60092530","afid":"60092530","affilname":"Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.","affiliation-city":"Shenzhen","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143","afid":"60064143","affilname":"Nanjing University of Information Science &amp; Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022904","afid":"60022904","affilname":"New Jersey Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Newark","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192930875","authid":"57192930875","authname":"Wang J.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Jinwei","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192070035","authid":"57192070035","authname":"Li T.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Ting","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404964736","authid":"7404964736","authname":"Shi Y.Q.","surname":"Shi","given-name":"Yun Qing","initials":"Y.Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022904"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005702391","authid":"7005702391","authname":"Lian S.","surname":"Lian","given-name":"Shiguo","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60092530"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35110226100","authid":"35110226100","authname":"Ye J.","surname":"Ye","given-name":"Jingyu","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022904"}]}],"authkeywords":"Contourlet wavelet transform | Discrete wavelet transform | Feature comparison | Forensics | Quaternion wavelet transform","source-id":"25627","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"12KJB520006","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85039914568"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85039914568?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85039914568&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85039914568&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85039914568","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85039914568","eid":"2-s2.0-85039914568","dc:title":"An adaptive noise canceller based on QLMS algorithm for removing EOG artifacts in EEG recordings","dc:creator":"Mengüč E.","prism:publicationName":"IDAP 2017 - International Artificial Intelligence and Data Processing Symposium","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538618806"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2017-10-30","prism:coverDisplayDate":"30 October 2017","prism:doi":"10.1109/IDAP.2017.8090246","dc:description":"In this paper, a novel adaptive noise canceller (ANC) based on the quaternion valued least mean square algorithm (QLMS) is designed in order to remove electrooculography (EOG) artifacts from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings.

Computer-aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems can be very helpful in this direction for radiologists to recognize abnormal and normal regions of interest in digital mammograms faster than traditional screening program. In this work, we propose a new method for breast cancer identification of all types of lesions in digital mammograms using multimodal fea-tures in a quaternionic representation. The proposed method con-sists of two steps: First, a novel feature extraction module utilizes two dimensional discrete transforms based on ART, Shapelets, Zernike moments and Gabor filters to decompose Regions of Sus-picion (ROS) into a set of localized basis functions with different shapes. The extracted features are then fused and presented in quaternionic representation to the classification module in the sec-ond step. For the classification task, we propose a new type of clas-sifier (Q-classifier) that successfully, accurately, with low compu-tational cost and higher speed of diagnosis, recognizes normal and abnormal ROS from mammograms. The proposed method is eval-uated on the Mini-MIAS database. The methods' performance is evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve. The achieved result AUC = 0.934 shows that the proposed method can be quite effective and can be used as a tool for efficiently diag-nosing breast cancer compared to similar techniques presented in the literature that use SVM classifiers and unimodal features.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031155","afid":"60031155","affilname":"University of Patras","affiliation-city":"Rio","affiliation-country":"Greece"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114397098","afid":"114397098","affilname":"Technical Educational Institute of Western","affiliation-city":null,"affiliation-country":"Greece"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004169705","authid":"7004169705","authname":"Apostolopoulos G.","surname":"Apostolopoulos","given-name":"G.","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031155"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701657688","authid":"6701657688","authname":"Koutras A.","surname":"Koutras","given-name":"A.","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031155"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"114397098"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602871056","authid":"6602871056","authname":"Christoyianni I.","surname":"Christoyianni","given-name":"I.","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031155"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35612928000","authid":"35612928000","authname":"Dermatas E.","surname":"Dermatas","given-name":"E.","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031155"}]}],"authkeywords":"ART | Breast Cancer | Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) | Gabor-Filter Banks | Quaternion | Shapelets | Zernike-Moments","article-number":"8081168","source-id":"21100850501","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85043276063"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85043276063?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85043276063&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85043276063&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85043276063","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85043276063","eid":"2-s2.0-85043276063","dc:title":"Relationship between the cayley–dickson fourier transform and the hartley transform of multidimensional real signals","dc:creator":"Snopek K.","prism:publicationName":"2017 40th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing, TSP 2017","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781509039821"}],"prism:volume":"2017-January","prism:pageRange":"497-501","prism:coverDate":"2017-10-19","prism:coverDisplayDate":"19 October 2017","prism:doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.8076036","dc:description":"The paper shows relations between two different frequency representations of n–dimensional signals (n = 1, 2, 3): the Cayley-Dickson Fourier transform and the Hartley transform.

This work tries to contribute in this direction by proposing an experiment that puts filters to the test with changing the input signal geometry.

The synthetic aperture is derived from the displacement of distributed UAVs (agents) operating in a sparse volumetric swarm. Heterogeneity arises from the changing orientation of an agent's antenna and receiving pattern function as it swarms in the distributed cluster of agents. This alters the agents' antenna pattern function(s) over time and alters the convergence and overall performance properties of vector-space direction of arrival techniques. The goal of this work is to evaluate the impact of the swarm density and orientation in this framework and study the convergence and error using this technique under different SNR conditions using the MUSIC algorithm. Simulation and measurements for up to sixteen elements on a thirty-Two-location test platform are provided and comparisons are made to benchmark their performance with theoretical expectations.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020547","afid":"60020547","affilname":"Texas A&amp;M University","affiliation-city":"College Station","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57200144559","authid":"57200144559","authname":"Chen Z.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Zhong","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020547"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602268540","authid":"6602268540","authname":"Chamberland J.","surname":"Chamberland","given-name":"Jean Francois","initials":"J.F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020547"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005239216","authid":"7005239216","authname":"Huff G.","surname":"Huff","given-name":"Gregory H.","initials":"G.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020547"}]}],"authkeywords":"Aperiodic arrays | Direction-of-Arrival estimation | Quaternions | Swarming | Unmanned aerial vehicles","article-number":"8074868","source-id":"21100844859","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85018917491"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85018917491?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85018917491&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85018917491&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0925231217306951"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85018917491","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85018917491","eid":"2-s2.0-85018917491","dc:title":"Gradient descent learning for quaternionic Hopfield neural networks","dc:creator":"Kobayashi M.","prism:publicationName":"Neurocomputing","prism:issn":"09252312","prism:eIssn":"18728286","prism:volume":"260","prism:pageRange":"174-179","prism:coverDate":"2017-10-18","prism:coverDisplayDate":"18 October 2017","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.neucom.2017.04.025","pii":"S0925231217306951","dc:description":"A Hopfield neural network (HNN) is a neural network model with mutual connections. A quaternionic HNN (QHNN) is an extension of HNN. Several QHNN models have been proposed. The hybrid QHNN utilizes the non-commutativity of quaternions. It has been shown that hybrid QHNNs with the Hebbian learning rule outperformed QHNNs in noise tolerance. The Hebbian learning rule, however, is a primitive learning algorithm, and it is necessary that we study advanced learning algorithms. Although the projection rule is one of a few promising learning algorithms, it is restricted by network topologies and cannot be applied to hybrid QHNNs. In the present work, we propose gradient descent learning, which can be applied to hybrid QHNNs. We compare the performance of gradient descent learning with that of projection rule. Results showed that the gradient descent learning outperformed projection rule in noise tolerance in computer simulations. For small training-pattern sets, hybrid QHNNs with gradient descent learning produced the best performances. QHNNs did so for large training-pattern set. In future, gradient descent learning will be extended to QHNNs with different network topology and activation function.","citedby-count":"19","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009064","afid":"60009064","affilname":"University of Yamanashi","affiliation-city":"Kofu","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55741799500","authid":"55741799500","orcid":"0000-0002-4453-0615","authname":"Kobayashi M.","surname":"Kobayashi","given-name":"Masaki","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009064"}]}],"authkeywords":"Gradient descent learning | Hopfield neural networks | Learning algorithm | Quaternion","source-id":"24807","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
