This paper extends our planar 4R linkage synthesis work to the spherical case. By utilizing kinematic mapping and quaternions, we map spherical displacements into points and the workspace constraints of the coupler into intersection of algebraic quadrics (called constraint manifold), respectively, in the image space of displacements. The problem of synthesizing a spherical 4R linkage is reduced to finding a pencil of quadrics that best fit the given image points in the least squares sense. Additional constraints on the pencil identify the quadrics that represent a spherical circular constraint. The geometric parameters of the quadrics encode information about the linkage parameters which are readily computed to obtain a spherical 4R linkage that best navigates through the given displacements. The result is an efficient and largely linear method for spherical four-bar motion generation problem.

We present a novel, unified, and simultaneous type and dimensional synthesis approach to planar parallel manipulator synthesis by using kinematic mapping, surface fitting, and least squares techniques. Novelty of our approach lies in linearization of a highly non-linear problem and the fact that the nature of the given motion or displacement drives the synthesis process without assuming triad topology or their geometry. It has been well established that by using planar quaternions and kinematic mapping, workspace related constraints of planar dyads or triads can be represented as algebraic constraint manifolds in the image space of planar displacements. The constraints associated with planar RR-, PR- and RP-dyads correspond to a single quadric in the image space, while that of each of the six planar triads (RRR, RPR, PRR, PPR, RRP and RPP) map to a pair of quadrics and the space between them. Moreover, the quadrics associated with RRR- and RPR-triads are of the same type as that of RR dyads, of PRR- and PPR-triads as that of PR-, and RRP- and RPP-triads as that of RP-dyad. This simplification nicely extends a dyad synthesis problem to a triad synthesis one. The problem is formulated as the least-squares error minimization problem to find a trinity of quadrics that best fit the image points of task displacements. The fitting error corresponding to each single quadric of the trinity is regarded as variation (thickness) of that quadric, which turns that quadric into a pair of quadrics. Hence, three dyads with minimal surface fitting errors can be converted to three triads in the Cartesian space.

This paper presents a scan-matching approach, based, instead on visual information from a stereo system. The Speeded Up Robust Feature (SURF) is used together with optimization tools constraints to get high matching precision between the stereo images. Calculating the 3D position of the corresponding points in the world results in a visual scan where each point has a descriptor attached to it. These descriptors can be used to associate scans observed from different positions. Just like in the work with laser based scan matching a map can be defined as a set of reference scans and their corresponding acquisition point. In this paper a robust Visual odometry and 3D reconstruction algorithm based on Adaptive Iterative Closest SURF for scan matching is proposed. This algorithm combine the robustness of SURF to detect and match good features and the accuracy an Adaptive ICP algorithm in which, the 3D point are weighted with their inverse depth to give more importance for near points. The proposed algorithm is validated and compared with two other optimization techniques based on Singular Values Decomposition (SVD) and Quaternion.

The proposed color image modeling method can be applied in color image processing tasks as a useful tool.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073555","afid":"60073555","affilname":"Huaiyin Teachers University","affiliation-city":"Huainan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004828","afid":"60004828","affilname":"Changchun Institute of Optics Fine Mechanics and Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36450684500","authid":"36450684500","authname":"Guo L.Q.","surname":"Guo","given-name":"Li Qiang","initials":"L.Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073555"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9238980500","authid":"9238980500","authname":"Zhu M.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Ming","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"}]}],"authkeywords":"Clifford algebra | Color image | Commutativity | Image processing","source-id":"21100226804","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84888867141"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84888867141?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84888867141&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84888867141&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84888867141","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84888867141","eid":"2-s2.0-84888867141","dc:title":"IMU-based online kinematic calibration of robot manipulator","dc:creator":"Du G.","prism:publicationName":"The Scientific World Journal","prism:eIssn":"1537744X","prism:volume":"2013","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2013-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2013","prism:doi":"10.1155/2013/139738","dc:description":"Robot calibration is a useful diagnostic method for improving the positioning accuracy in robot production and maintenance. An online robot self-calibration method based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) is presented in this paper. The method requires that the IMU is rigidly attached to the robot manipulator, which makes it possible to obtain the orientation of the manipulator with the orientation of the IMU in real time. This paper proposed an efficient approach which incorporates Factored Quaternion Algorithm (FQA) and Kalman Filter (KF) to estimate the orientation of the IMU. Then, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is used to estimate kinematic parameter errors. Using this proposed orientation estimation method will result in improved reliability and accuracy in determining the orientation of the manipulator. Compared with the existing vision-based self-calibration methods, the great advantage of this method is that it does not need the complex steps, such as camera calibration, images capture, and corner detection, which make the robot calibration procedure more autonomous in a dynamic manufacturing environment. Experimental studies on a GOOGOL GRB3016 robot show that this method has better accuracy, convenience, and effectiveness than vision-based methods. © 2013 Guanglong Du and Ping Zhang.","citedby-count":"24","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024542","afid":"60024542","affilname":"South China University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"pubmed-id":"24302854","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36959418400","authid":"36959418400","authname":"Du G.","surname":"Du","given-name":"Guanglong","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024542"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55901894400","authid":"55901894400","authname":"Zhang P.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Ping","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024542"}]}],"article-number":"139738","source-id":"24219","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84888829392"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84888829392?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84888829392&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84888829392&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0723086912000552"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84888829392","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84888829392","eid":"2-s2.0-84888829392","dc:title":"Quadratic forms, compositions and triality over F1","dc:creator":"Knus M.A.","prism:publicationName":"Expositiones Mathematicae","prism:issn":"07230869","prism:volume":"31","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"305-333","prism:coverDate":"2013-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2013","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.exmath.2012.08.014","pii":"S0723086912000552","dc:description":"According to Tits, the quadric of dimension 6 over the \"field\" F1 with one element is a set of 8 points structured by a permutation of order 2 without fixed points. Subsets that are disjoint from their image under the permutation are the subspaces of the quadric. As in the classical case of hyperbolic quadrics over an arbitrary field, maximal subspaces come in two different types. We define a geometric triality to be a permutation of order 3 of the set consisting of points and maximal subspaces, carrying points to maximal subspaces of one type and maximal subspaces of the other type to points while preserving the incidence relations. We show analogues over F1 of the one-to-one correspondence between geometric trialities, trialitarian automorphisms of algebraic groups of type D4, and symmetric composition algebras of dimension 8. Here, the algebraic groups of type D4 are replaced by their Weyl group, which is the semi-direct product b{cyrillic}23 × b{cyrillic}4, and composition algebras by a certain type of binary operation on a quadric to which a 0 is adjoined. As in the classical case, we show that there are two types of trialities, one related to octonions and the other to Okubo algebras. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025858","afid":"60025858","affilname":"ETH Zürich","affiliation-city":"Zurich ZH,","affiliation-country":"Switzerland"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000874","afid":"60000874","affilname":"Université Catholique de Louvain","affiliation-city":"Louvain-la-Neuve","affiliation-country":"Belgium"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16468296600","authid":"16468296600","authname":"Knus M.A.","surname":"Knus","given-name":"M.

We propose Corisco, a monocular orientation estimation method based on edgels instead of lines. Edgels are points sampled from image edges with their tangential directions, extracted in Corisco using a grid mask. The estimation aligns the measured edgel directions with the predicted directions calculated from the orientation, using a known camera model. Corisco uses the M-estimation technique to define an objective function that is optimized by two algorithms in sequence: RANSAC, which gives robustness and flexibility to Corisco, and FilterSQP, which performs a continuous optimization to refine the initial estimate, using closed formulas for the function derivatives. Corisco is the first edgel-based method able to analyze images with any camera model, and it also allows for a compromise between speed and accuracy, so that its performance can be tuned according to the application requirements. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Corisco with various camera models, and its performance surpasses similar edgel-based methods. The accuracy displayed a mean error below 2° for execution times above 8 s in a conventional computer, and above 3° for less than 2 s. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Meanwhile, using the quaternion Fourier transform based phase spectrum of an image or a frame in a video obtains the spatio-temporal saliency map, which shows the result of attention selection.

The proposed algorithm agrees with the commercial navigation product, Satellite Tool Kit®, within 0.5 m in ideal situations. The inherent uncertainties in ISS attitude and state determinations, and the International Space Station Agriculture Camera (ISSAC) tilting angle were estimated to introduce an error less than 800 m. However, the actual geolocation error evaluated using the images obtained by the ISSAC is roughly 4 km, much greater than the inherent uncertainty and mainly due to (a) delay caused by the Windows® operating system in acquiring images, and (b) the misalignment of the ISSAC sensor coordinate system with the ISS body-fixed coordinate system.

In-flight testing will be realized withthe use of two unmanned flying platforms equipped with an electrical engine and a piston engine.The total mass of the platforms is 5 kg and 25 kg respectively. The article presents the structure ofthe control and navigation system and then, the structure of the measurement system. Themeasurement units consist of a GPS receiver, an attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) andan air data computer (ADC). Similar configuration is used in other micro UAV solutions, such asMicropilot or Kestrel. Then, algorithms of the measurement system are described. Navigation isbased on GPS data with a DGPS (Differential GPS) advanced module. If the measurementinformation is complete, GPS data are used to correct measurements from other units. The systemestimates wind disturbances and calculates accelerometers errors. In the case of missing GPSsignals implementation of low-cost sensors may lead to significant measurement errors, and hencenavigation only by means of the INS is impossible. In such a case, navigation is realized with theuse of an inertial navigation system (INS), the magnetic heading measurement and ADC. AHRSunit algorithms use quaternion algebra for attitude calculation. For correction, complementaryfiltering is implemented[1],[4]. The correction signal for the attitude (pitch and roll angles) iscalculated with the use of acceleration measurements. Measurements of accelerations and yaw ratesare used for the correction switching mechanism, since in dynamic states signals calculated fromaccelerations cannot be used for correction. Heading is corrected by means of magnetic headingmeasurement. ADC algorithms are based on typical aerodynamic dependences. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","citedby-count":"17","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032402","afid":"60032402","affilname":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The construction of such motions, using curves that possess rational RMDFs, is considered herein. In particular, the construction entails interpolation of initial/final camera positions and orientations, together with an initial motion direction. To achieve this, the camera path is described by a rational space curve that has a rational RMDF and interpolates the prescribed data. Numerical experiments are used to illustrate implementation of the method, and sufficient conditions on the two end frame orientations are derived, to ensure the existence of exactly one interpolant. By specifiying a sequence of discrete camera positions/orientations and an initial motion direction, the method can be used to construct general rotation-minimizing camera motions. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021859","afid":"60021859","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Firenze","affiliation-city":"Florence","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014439","afid":"60014439","affilname":"University of California, Davis","affiliation-city":"Davis","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006823457","authid":"7006823457","authname":"Farouki R.T.","surname":"Farouki","given-name":"Rida T.","initials":"R.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014439"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23468999200","authid":"23468999200","authname":"Giannelli C.","surname":"Giannelli","given-name":"Carlotta","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021859"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603641743","authid":"6603641743","authname":"Sestini A.","surname":"Sestini","given-name":"Alessandra","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021859"}]}],"authkeywords":"Angular velocity | Camera orientation | Directed frames | Interpolation | Pythagorean curves | Quaternions | Rotation-minimizing frames","source-id":"28041","fund-acr":"INdAM","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica \"Francesco Severi\"","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84872871571"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84872871571?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84872871571&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84872871571&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-B9780124076709000068"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84872871571","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84872871571","eid":"2-s2.0-84872871571","dc:title":"Perspectives on color image processing by linear vector methods using projective geometric transformations","dc:creator":"Sangwine S.J.","prism:publicationName":"Advances in Imaging and Electron Physics","prism:issn":"10765670","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780124076709"}],"prism:volume":"175","prism:pageRange":"283-307","prism:coverDate":"2013-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2013","prism:doi":"10.1016/B978-0-12-407670-9.00006-8","pii":"B9780124076709000068","dc:description":"Development of processing methods for color images has been slow, but over the past 10-15 years ideas have been developed employing geometric operations implemented with quaternion algebra in the color space of the image pixels as generalizations of the fundamental scaling and spatial shift operations of linear grey-scale image processing. The goal has been filters that are sensitive in some way to both color and spatial features. In Euclidean color space the set of linear operations is very limited. Recent developments, however, have shown that there is a simple connection between geometric operations expressed using quaternion equations and those expressed as 4×4 matrices using homogeneous coordinates. These operations include projective transformations as well as all the classical Euclidean operations. Remarkably, they are all linear in homogeneous coordinates. This realization greatly expands the possibilities of linear vector filtering methods and means that the insight gained by working in quaternion algebra can be applied to the design of algorithms implemented using matrix methods. This paper (1) illustrates the use of simple quaternion equations to express geometric operations and (2) shows how the use of homogeneous coordinates makes it possible to work with quite difficult geometric transformations relatively easily. The possibilities for using projective and other transformations for devising new types of color image filter are shown and the difficulties discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Unlike previous works of color optical flow methods that treat color as separating channels, the proposed algorithm exploits quaternion representation of color and processes color as a holistic signal. In this way, it enables more accurate flow estimation at the pixel locations of spatial color variations, and reduces tracking errors by leaving more features points at their correct locations on the target. For successful and efficient object tracking, we also proposed a novel type of quaternion color corners that are reliable features during tracking. Together with grayscale corners, they form a good feature point set, especially when used with the proposed quaternion optical flow algorithm. We conduct a quantitative evaluation on publicly available dataset to verify the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. And object tracking experiments demonstrate that robust tracking can be achieved for real-time applications. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Two dimensional SDHT is applied on each 2 x 2 sub-image block of the carrier image in row major order. Two bits are embedded in second, third and fourth frequency components of each 2 x 2 mask in transformed domain based on a secret key. Second and third bit position in each frequency coefficient has been chosen as embedding position. A delicate re-adjustment has incorporated in the first frequency component of each mask, to keep the quantum value positive in spatial domain without hampering the embedded bits. Inverse SDHT (ISDHT) is applied on each 2 x 2 mask as post embedding operation to produce the watermarked image. At the receiving end reverse operation is performed to extract the stream which is compared to the original stream for authentication.
