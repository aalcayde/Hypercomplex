To fully enable its autonomous control capability, the navigation system requires estimates of the vehicle position, velocity and heading angle. Also, to control stability of the vehicle during more difficult maneuvers, estimation of bank angle as well as pitch angle should be provided. The estimation problem is complicated by the large random-walk error, along with vehicle's wide-band vibration. By combining the IMU data with GPS position measurements, the position estimation is adequate, and by incorporating Centaur's kinematics model (and using its stepper motors control input signals), the velocity and orientation estimation effectively improves. The filter represents quaternion rather than Euler angles which eliminates the problem of singularities and relatively high required computation time associated with attitude estimation. Both computer simulation results and real-time experimental results show that integrated system has better long-term precision than a low-cost INS alone, and also better than a stand GPS in terms of availability and continuity. © 2007 IEEE.","citedby-count":"16","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014171","afid":"60014171","affilname":"University of Waterloo","affiliation-city":"Waterloo","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56186246700","authid":"56186246700","authname":"Jun Z.","surname":"Jun","given-name":"Zhou","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014171"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23059241300","authid":"23059241300","authname":"Bolandhemmat H.","surname":"Bolandhemmat","given-name":"Hamidreza","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014171"}]}],"authkeywords":"Autonomous mobile vehicle | Extended Kalman filter | GPS | Integrated INS/GPS system | MEMS-IMU","article-number":"4303628","source-id":"9300153114","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84863773784"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84863773784?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84863773784&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84863773784&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84863773784","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84863773784","eid":"2-s2.0-84863773784","dc:title":"Dependencies between coding gain and filter length in paraunitary filter banks designed using quaternionic approach","dc:creator":"Parfieniuk M.","prism:publicationName":"European Signal Processing Conference","prism:issn":"22195491","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9788392134022"}],"prism:pageRange":"1327-1331","prism:coverDate":"2007-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2007","dc:description":"In this paper, we investigate the performance limits of four-channel paraunitary filter banks designed using quaternionic approach.

In this paper, we present quaternionic lattice structure for eight-band oversampled linear-phase paraunitary filter banks (OLPPUFBs) which guarantees orthogonality of the filters regardless of the coefficient precision. © 2007 IEEE.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002096","afid":"60002096","affilname":"Bialystok University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Bialystok","affiliation-country":"Poland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6506558733","authid":"6506558733","authname":"Parfieniuk M.","surname":"Parfieniuk","given-name":"Marek","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002096"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25937204400","authid":"25937204400","authname":"Petrovsky A.","surname":"Petrovsky","given-name":"Alexander","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002096"}]}],"article-number":"5903299","source-id":"19900192503","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79960406473"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79960406473?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=79960406473&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=79960406473&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79960406473","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:79960406473","eid":"2-s2.0-79960406473","dc:title":"Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications, SPA 2007 - Workshop Proceedings","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications, SPA 2007 - Workshop Proceedings","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781424415144"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2007-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2007","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 31 papers.

The orientation is with respect to a particular reference like the Earth and Sun [1]. The spacecraft is considered to be a rigid body whose attitude can be described by two sets of equations, namely, the kinematics equation, which relates the time derivatives of the orientation angles to the an- gular velocity vector and the dynamics equation, which describes the time evolution of the angular velocity vector [2, 3]. Various parameterizations of the attitude exist to represent the orientation angles. A comprehensive survey of attitude representations is given in [4]. The attitude control problem was first presented in the literature in [5]. A general procedure for the design and analysis of a three-axis, large-angle attitude control system was developed based on properties common to all attitude control systems. In [6], a general framework is prepared for the analysis of attitude tracking control of a rigid body using the non- singular unit quaternion representation. An adaptive tracking control scheme wherein the unknown spacecraft inertia matrix is compensated using linear parameterization is discussed in [7]. Reference [8] proposes an adaptive attitude tracking controller that identifies the inertia matrix via periodic command signals. Reference [9] discusses the adaptive attitude tracking control using synthesized velocity from attitude measurements by incorporating a velocity filter formulation. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2007.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009506","afid":"60009506","affilname":"King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals","affiliation-city":"Dhahran","affiliation-country":"Saudi Arabia"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005728892","authid":"7005728892","authname":"Al-Garni A.","surname":"Al-Garni","given-name":"Ahmed","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009506"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26664070600","authid":"26664070600","authname":"Kassem A.","surname":"Kassem","given-name":"Ayman","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009506"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56986744500","authid":"56986744500","authname":"Shafiq M.","surname":"Shafiq","given-name":"Muhammad","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009506"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55425649700","authid":"55425649700","authname":"Ahmed R.","surname":"Ahmed","given-name":"Rihan","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009506"}]}],"source-id":"13412","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/71549134658"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/71549134658?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=71549134658&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=71549134658&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/71549134658","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:71549134658","eid":"2-s2.0-71549134658","dc:title":"A new motion-texture graph for generating real-time realistic human motions","dc:creator":"Aboul-Hassan A.A.K.","prism:publicationName":"ISSPIT 2007 - 2007 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781424418350"}],"prism:pageRange":"1023-1028","prism:coverDate":"2007-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2007","prism:doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2007.4458208","dc:description":"Motion-Texture synthesis is a new field of research which aims at generating new human motions from a given Motion Capture (MoCap) data.

The current work proposes a new Motion-Texture Graph called Quaternions MRF Motion-Texture Graph (QMMTG). QMMTG technique uses quaternions to devise a proposedfast matching criterion and a proposed simple methodfor smoother transitions among QMMTG nodes. QMMTG technique manages to generate a wider range of new motions and even better results in some cases. Besides, the smoothing algorithm has perceptually enhanced the resulting motions in comparison to the previous works.

Much research has been done to understand some of the causes of distortion in ISAR imaging mostly under the limited assumption that a target's axis of rotation is constant over the CPI, This paper investigates how the target's time-varying Doppler generating axis of rotation, caused by the complex 3D motion of a target at sea, contributes to ISAR image blurring. Quaternion algebra is used to aid the characterisation of a time-varying Doppler generating axis of rotation on the migration through cross-range cells. Real motion data of a sailing yacht is used to examine the effects of 3D rotational motion on ISAR imagery of point scatterer like simulated targets and the associated blurring. Simulation results show that small yaw rate perturbation during side-view ISAR imaging intervals gives rise to significant changes in the direction of the Doppler generating axis which results in scatters migration through cross-range cells.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013272","afid":"60013272","affilname":"The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research","affiliation-city":"Pretoria","affiliation-country":"South Africa"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8863827700","authid":"8863827700","authname":"Abdul Gaffar M.","surname":"Abdul Gaffar","given-name":"M.

The paper shows that 2-D hypercomplex basis wavelets can be used to generate steerable filters which allow rotation as well as translation. © 2007 IEEE.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032204","afid":"60032204","affilname":"Sheffield Hallam University","affiliation-city":"Sheffield","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16246919900","authid":"16246919900","authname":"Wedekind J.","surname":"Wedekind","given-name":"J.","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032204"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6508317082","authid":"6508317082","authname":"Amavasai B.","surname":"Amavasai","given-name":"B.","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032204"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003756067","authid":"7003756067","authname":"Dutton K.","surname":"Dutton","given-name":"K.","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032204"}]}],"authkeywords":"Algorithms | Feature extraction | Image processing | Linear systems | Wavelet transforms","article-number":"4728563","source-id":"15600154722","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/51349133735"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/51349133735?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=51349133735&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=51349133735&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/51349133735","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:51349133735","eid":"2-s2.0-51349133735","dc:title":"Adaptive motion estimation of a tumbling satellite using laser-vision data with unknown noise characteristics","dc:creator":"Aghili F.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"1424409128"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781424409129"}],"prism:pageRange":"839-846","prism:coverDate":"2007-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2007","prism:doi":"10.1109/IROS.2007.4399143","dc:description":"A noise-adaptive variant of the Kalman filter is presented for the motion estimation and prediction of a free-falling tumbling satellite as seen from a satellite in a neighboring orbit. A complete dynamics model, including aspects of orbital mechanics, is incorporated for accurate estimation. Moreover, a discrete-time model of the entire system which includes the state-transition matrix and the covariance of process noise are derived effectively in a closed form, which is essential for the real-time implementation of the Kalman filter. We will show that the translational and rotational measurements are coupled and consequently derive the corresponding observation matrix. The statistical characteristics of the measurement noise is formulated by a state-dependent covariance matrix. This model allows additive quaternion noise, while preserving the unit-norm property of the quaternion. The estimator takes the noisy measurements from a laser vision system with unknown and possibly varying statistical noise properties, and subsequently the estimator adaptively estimates the full sates, i.e., the pose and the velocities, in addition to the covariance of the measurement noise and the inertial parameters of the target satellite. Simulations and experiments conducted will demonstrate the quality performance of the adaptive estimator. ©2007 IEEE.","citedby-count":"27","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007248","afid":"60007248","affilname":"Canadian Space Agency","affiliation-city":"Longueuil","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003923445","authid":"7003923445","authname":"Aghili F.","surname":"Aghili","given-name":"Farhad","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007248"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701319457","authid":"6701319457","authname":"Parsa K.","surname":"Parsa","given-name":"Kourosh","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007248"}]}],"article-number":"4399143","source-id":"66854","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/48649099538"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/48649099538?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=48649099538&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=48649099538&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/48649099538","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:48649099538","eid":"2-s2.0-48649099538","dc:title":"Generalized analysis of electrical circuits by using hypernion matrixes","dc:creator":"Berkovich Y.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE AFRICON Conference","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"142440987X"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781424409877"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2007-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2007","prism:doi":"10.1109/AFRCON.2007.4401600","dc:description":"In this paper a novel method for circuit analysis is proposed. It is based on using symbolic analysis in matrix form, which is especially appropriate for repetitive similar calculations of the same circuit. The method, which applies hyper-complex numbers (hypernions), was first developed by the authors for analyzing the non-sinusoidal operation of electrical circuits. Now, the method has been extended to the analysis of electronic/switching circuits in which the sources and/or the parameters are step-wisely changed as a result of switching. Such circuits are common in different kinds of DC-DC converters (such as Buck, Boost, Cuk, etc. converters). The proposed method gives a new approach to the analysis of the above circuits by opening the possibility of treating them in a general-analytical form, just like in regular electrical circuits having a constant configuration and constant parameters. The computation of such kinds of circuits by using the proposed method becomes very simple, since the circuit does not have to be analyzed many times, each time for a different configuration, but at once by performing a parallel computation. The theoretical presentation is accompanied by numerical examples. ©2007 IEEE.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016941","afid":"60016941","affilname":"Holon Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Holon","affiliation-country":"Israel"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000251","afid":"60000251","affilname":"IEEE","affiliation-city":"New York","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56271175800","authid":"56271175800","authname":"Berkovich Y.","surname":"Berkovich","given-name":"Y.","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000251"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016941"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56627687900","authid":"56627687900","authname":"Shenkman A.","surname":"Shenkman","given-name":"A.","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000251"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016941"}]}],"authkeywords":"Circuits with changing topology | Electrical circuits | Hyper-complex numbers | Matrixes | Non-sinusoidal signals","article-number":"4401600","source-id":"88865","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/47649113625"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/47649113625?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=47649113625&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=47649113625&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/47649113625","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:47649113625","eid":"2-s2.0-47649113625","dc:title":"A simple orthogonal space-time-polarization block code","dc:creator":"Wysocki B.J.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference","prism:issn":"15502252","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"1424402646"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781424402649"}],"prism:pageRange":"754-757","prism:coverDate":"2007-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2007","prism:doi":"10.1109/VETECF.2007.167","dc:description":"This letter proposes a simple but highly efficient technique to jointly utilize space, time, and polarization diversities.

We assume that the camera looks at three fixed points while translating and rotating in 3D space. To estimate the camera parameters, we get a set of nonlinear equations derived from a geometric perspective camera model. We have a large number of image frames to find each camera parameters while the number of unknown camera model parameters cannot be determined from a single frame. In order to solve this problem, we used interpolation to approximate camera movement in both translation and rotation. This was done using the concept of control node set at the specific frame in the video stream. The camera movement is based on acceleration level control while satisfying physical constraints. The control node is the set of variables used to determine acceleration-based interpolated equation used for data fitting. In this process, we used quaternion to interpolate orientation of the camera. The acceleration-based data fitting problem is solved using nonlinear parameter optimization solver, GRG2.

We can apply this algorithm to the task of completing colour images by processing the three colour channels separately and combining the results. However, this approach does not capture the correlations across the colour layers and, thus, may miss out on information important to the completion process. In this paper, we introduce the use of quaternions or hypercomplex numbers in estimating the potential functions for the image completion algorithm. The potential functions are calculated by correlating quaternion image patches based on the recently developed concepts of quaternion Fourier transform and quaternion correlation.

The control objective is for the object to track a desired trajectory determined by a sequence of prerecorded images from a stationary camera. To achieve this result, several technical issues were resolved including: discriminating the relative velocity between the moving camera and the moving object, compensating for the unknown time-varying distance measurement from the camera to the object, relating the unknown attitude of the control object to some measurable signals, and using unit quaternion to formulate the rotation motion and rotation error system. By utilizing multi-view image geometry to develop homography relationships between the moving camera frame and the moving planar patch coordinate systems, the relative velocity issue is resolved. By using the depth ratios obtained from the homography decomposition, the unknown depth information is related to an unknown constant that can be compensated for by a Lyapunov-based adaptive update law.

Related measuring technique based on rotational stereo is proposed. The rotational stereo transformation about arbitrary rotation axis in visual space is defined by quaternion representation, and then the working principle and the structure of the system are designed. The weak perspective vision model based on the imaging geometry of RSMMS is introduced. Based on the perspective projection relation of RSMMS, visual space distortion of a micro measurement system based on rotational stereo is researched. The variation of 3d iso-distortion surface depending on the distortion factor is analyzed.
