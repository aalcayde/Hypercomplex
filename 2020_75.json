Firstly, the quaternionic representation was performed on the color image in the sliding window, and then the histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) feature was extracted over the quaternionic representation map. After that, the QHOG histogram was constructed to represent the sliding window. Two groups of experiments are performed on two popular pedestrian datasets, INRIA dataset and Daimler Chrysler (DC) dataset, respectively.

Recently, the measure of VRD through electrocardiogram intervals has been strongly questioned. The search for an efficient and non-invasive surrogate marker of drug-induced dispersion effects constitute an urgent research challenge. Methods: Herein, drug-induced ventricular dispersion is generated by d-Sotalol supply in an In-vitro rabbit heart model. A cilindrical chamber simulates the thorax and a multi-electrode net is used to obtain spatial electrocardiographic signals. Cardiac vector dynamics is captured by novel velocity cardiomarkers obtained by quaternion methods. Through statistical analysis and machine learning technics, we compute potential dispersion markers that could define proarrhythmic risk. Results: The cardiomarkers with the greatest statistical significance, both obtained from the electrical cardiac vector, were: the QTω, which is the difference between first and last maxima of angular velocity and λ21vT, the roundness of linear velocity. When comparing with the performance of the current standards (89%), this pair was able to correctly separate 21 out of 22 experiments achieving a performance of 95%. Moreover, the QTω computes in a much more robust basis the QT interval, the current index for drug regulation. Discussion: These velocity markers circumvent the problems of accuratelly finding the fiducial points such as the always tricky T-wave end. Given the high performance they achieved, it is provided a promising outcome for future applications to the detection of anomalous changes of heterogeneity that may be useful for the purposes of torsadogenic toxicity studies.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60066463","afid":"60066463","affilname":"Instituto Argentino de Matematica","affiliation-city":"Buenos Aires","affiliation-country":"Argentina"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023955","afid":"60023955","affilname":"Jozef Stefan Institute","affiliation-city":"Ljubljana","affiliation-country":"Slovenia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001563","afid":"60001563","affilname":"Universidad de Buenos Aires","affiliation-city":"Buenos Aires","affiliation-country":"Argentina"}],"pubmed-id":"32645483","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56562887200","authid":"56562887200","authname":"Cruces P.D.","surname":"Cruces","given-name":"Pablo Daniel","initials":"P.D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001563"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60066463"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24280642600","authid":"24280642600","authname":"Torkar D.","surname":"Torkar","given-name":"Drago","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023955"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602348313","authid":"6602348313","authname":"Arini P.D.","surname":"Arini","given-name":"Pedro David","initials":"P.D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001563"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60066463"}]}],"authkeywords":"Cardiac electrical vector | Heterogeneity | Proarrhythmic side effects | Quaternion methods | Sotalol","article-number":"106894","source-id":"25146","fund-acr":"CONICET","fund-no":"PIP #112- 20130100552CO","fund-sponsor":"Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85081131692"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85081131692?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85081131692&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85081131692&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0031320320301278"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85081131692","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85081131692","eid":"2-s2.0-85081131692","dc:title":"New fractional-order Legendre-Fourier moments for pattern recognition applications","dc:creator":"Hosny K.M.","prism:publicationName":"Pattern Recognition","prism:issn":"00313203","prism:volume":"103","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2020","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.patcog.2020.107324","pii":"S0031320320301278","dc:description":"Orthogonal moments enable computer-based systems to discriminate between similar objects.

The proposed scheme incorporates extreme pixel adjustment (EPA), multi-bit partly sign-altered mean modulation (MPSAM), mixed modulation (MM), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) within a scheme based on crisscross inter-block quaternion discrete Fourier transform (QDFT). Accordingly, the proposed scheme employing EPA, MPSAM, MM, and QDFT is referred to as EMMQ. The image is separated into non-overlapping 8 × 8 pixel blocks, whereupon MPSAM is used to map multiple bits within a single block using multiple coefficients in one of the four transformed components of QDFT. The use of MM to embed the watermark allows for superior image quality and strong resistance to image processing attacks. Our use of PSO also makes it possible to optimize the EMMQ parameters, thereby enabling outstanding robustness without compromising imperceptibility. Experiment results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme in resisting a variety of image-processing attacks, with performance superior to that of existing watermarking schemes in terms of imperceptibility and robustness for a given payload capacity.","citedby-count":"36","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028478","afid":"60028478","affilname":"National Ilan University","affiliation-city":"Yilan","affiliation-country":"Taiwan"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/112926910","afid":"112926910","affilname":"St. Mary's Junior College of Medicine","affiliation-city":"I-lan","affiliation-country":"Taiwan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26654165700","authid":"26654165700","orcid":"0000-0002-9543-6872","authname":"Hsu L.Y.","surname":"Hsu","given-name":"Ling Yuan","initials":"L.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"112926910"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404097894","authid":"7404097894","authname":"Hu H.T.","surname":"Hu","given-name":"Hwai Tsu","initials":"H.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028478"}]}],"authkeywords":"Blind image watermarking | Extreme pixel adjustment | MPSAM | Particle swarm optimization | Quaternion discrete Fourier transform","article-number":"113225","source-id":"24201","fund-acr":"MOST","fund-no":"106 –2221-E-562–001","fund-sponsor":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85093826448"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85093826448?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85093826448&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85093826448&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85093826448","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85093826448","eid":"2-s2.0-85093826448","dc:title":"Color Stereo Image Zero-Watermarking using Quaternion Radial Tchebichef Moments","dc:creator":"Yamni M.","prism:publicationName":"2020 International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Computer Vision, ISCV 2020","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781728180410"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2020","prism:doi":"10.1109/ISCV49265.2020.9204169","dc:description":"This paper presents a new zero-watermarking scheme, for the copyright protection of stereo color images, based on the Quaternion Radial Tchebichef Moments (QRTMs) and on a chaotic system very sensitive to the initial values.

According to the movable and the receiving terminal characteristics of YPS fixed on the moving target, a three-dimensional reconstruction model of spatial point light sources and a quaternion pose calculation algorithm based on cooperative points on YPS are established When the image coordinates of three visible point light sources are collected in turn. Then, the coordinates and attitude angle of the moving target can be solved when the moving target is within the measurable view field of YPS. Simulation and experiment analyze the influence of different parameters on YPS. In the center of cylinder lens with good linearity, it is verified that that the new YPS can achieve accurate single point positioning. The error of point coordinate is not larger than 3 mm.

The experimental results show that by using the filtered attitude angle, the target positioning error can be effectively reduced.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029322","afid":"60029322","affilname":"Dalian Maritime University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15730329300","authid":"15730329300","authname":"Dong L.L.","surname":"Dong","given-name":"Li Li","initials":"L.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029322"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57218913574","authid":"57218913574","authname":"Xu S.T.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Shi Ting","initials":"S.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029322"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404429104","authid":"7404429104","authname":"Xu W.H.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Wen Hai","initials":"W.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029322"}]}],"authkeywords":"Airborne photoelectric platform | Coordinate transformation | Error analysis | Extended Kalman filtering | Sea surface target location","source-id":"6600153203","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85085640195"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85085640195?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85085640195&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85085640195&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85085640195","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85085640195","eid":"2-s2.0-85085640195","dc:title":"Geometric Algebra Correntropy: Definition and Application to Robust Adaptive Filtering","dc:creator":"Wang W.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","prism:issn":"15497747","prism:eIssn":"15583791","prism:volume":"67","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"1164-1168","prism:coverDate":"2020-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2020","prism:doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2019.2931507","dc:description":"Correntropy is an efficient tool for analyzing higher order statistical moments in non-Gaussian noise environments.

From the probabilistic view, this brief presents a novel geometric algebra correntropy (GAC) which represents the similarity measure between two random geometric algebra (multivector valued) variables. Then, we develop the adaptive filter based on the maximum GAC criteria (MGACC), which is robust against the non-Gaussian noise.

A signal flow graph and an electronic circuit implementation are designed, analyzed, and constructed to realize the novel Chen system. The control problem of chaotic nonlinear systems with quaternion variables is investigated. We propose and design an approach to build a controller for these systems. The viability and usefulness of the suggested approach are illustrated by an application to the chaotic Chen model with quaternion variables. Using the proposed method, the attractors of the quaternion Chen model are transformed to trivial fixed point, quasi-periodic, or periodic (limit cycle) states.

Moments are successfully used in object descriptions, recognition, and other applications. However, image representation and recognition using quaternion moments are compute-intensive processes. This obstacle makes this type of moment unsuitable for real-time or large-scale applications, despite their high accuracy. In this work, we expose the challenges to parallelizing quaternion moment computations and transform the sequential algorithm to a parallel-friendly counterpart. We propose a set of parallel implementations for parallelizing quaternion moment image representations on different parallel architectures. The proposed implementations target multicore CPU-only, GPU-only, and hybrid CPU–GPUs (with multicore CPU and multi-GPU) environments. The loop mitigation technique is proposed to boost the level of parallelism in massively parallel environments, balance the parallel workload, and reduce both the space complexity and synchronization overhead of the proposed implementations. The loop mitigation technique could be applicable to other applications with similar loop imbalances. Finally, experiments are performed to evaluate the proposed implementations. Applying a moment order of 60 on a color image of 1024×1024 pixels, the proposed implementation achieved, on four P100 GPUs and a CPU with 16 cores, speedup of 257× and 277× over the baseline performance on a single Intel Xeon E5-2609 CPU core for image reconstruction and quaternion moment computation, respectively. In addition, 180× speedup is achieved for color image watermarking application.","citedby-count":"13","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60274165","afid":"60274165","affilname":"Faculty of Computers and Information","affiliation-city":"Zagazig","affiliation-country":"Egypt"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60273131","afid":"60273131","affilname":"Faculty of Science","affiliation-city":"Asyut","affiliation-country":"Egypt"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032356","afid":"60032356","affilname":"Hunan University","affiliation-city":"Changsha","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003212","afid":"60003212","affilname":"The University of Texas at San Antonio","affiliation-city":"San Antonio","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55586510800","authid":"55586510800","authname":"Salah A.","surname":"Salah","given-name":"Ahmad","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60274165"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404988992","authid":"7404988992","authname":"Li K.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Kenli","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032356"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205214086","authid":"57205214086","authname":"Hosny K.M.","surname":"Hosny","given-name":"Khalid M.","initials":"K.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60274165"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205229124","authid":"57205229124","authname":"Darwish M.M.","surname":"Darwish","given-name":"Mohamed M.","initials":"M.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60273131"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209993060","authid":"57209993060","authname":"Tian Q.","surname":"Tian","given-name":"Qi","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003212"}]}],"authkeywords":"CPU–GPU | Multi-GPU | Parallel implementation | Quaternion moments | Speedup","source-id":"12264","fund-acr":"NSF","fund-no":"61602170","fund-sponsor":"National Science Foundation","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85079183419"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85079183419?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85079183419&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85079183419&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0165168420300566"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85079183419","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85079183419","eid":"2-s2.0-85079183419","dc:title":"Dual-tree biquaternion wavelet transform and its application to color image fusion","dc:creator":"Guo L.","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing","prism:issn":"01651684","prism:volume":"171","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2020","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.sigpro.2020.107513","pii":"S0165168420300566","dc:description":"The dual-tree framework of wavelet transforms has gained popularity since they provide low-redundancy directional analyses of images.

Hence, researchers explored recently a more general and sophisticated model than the previous one, which is the quaternion-valued neural networks. The quaternions, which can also be defined as 2 × 2 matrix of complex numbers, have the capacity to analyze three or more dimensional signals and represent spatial transformations. In this paper, some sufficient conditions are given for the existence and various kinds of stability for the unique Stepanov-like pseudo almost periodic solution of quaternion-valued fuzzy recurrent neural networks.

Instead of the minimum mean square error principle, the maximum correntropy criterion is applied in the update process, which is robust to heavy-tailed noises. Considering the linear form in the update process, the information filtering algorithm is applied in the proposed method to simplify the calculation of multisensor information fusion.

However, when it comes to the situation where strong desired signal and steering vector are mismatched, the performance of Q-MVDR will be degraded significantly, which can even aggravate the signal self-nulling effect. To address this problem, a robust beamforming algorithm based on quaternion matrix reconstruction was proposed. First, a quaternion signal model of polarization sensitive array was established, and the covariance matrix reconstruction method was extended to the quaternion domain. The steering vector and power of interference signals were obtained by subspace method, and the Capon spectral estimator was adopted to reconstruct the interference-plus-noise covariance matrix. Then, according to the orthogonality of signal subspace and noise subspace, as well as the characteristics that the desired signal vector and signal subspace belong to the same subspace, an improved version of steering vector mismatch correction method was introduced, which utilized the projection technique of weight vector to eigenspace signal subspace. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm was verified by numerical simulations. Simulation results show that the proposed technique had better robustness than traditional Q-MVDR algorithm in effectively avoiding the performance degradation caused by signal self-nulling effect, and it is able to provide similar SINR close to the optimal value in both strong desired signal and steering vector mismatch cases.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60102437","afid":"60102437","affilname":"China Academy of Space Technology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222330188","authid":"57222330188","authname":"Zhang X.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xue","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57217128511","authid":"57217128511","authname":"Zhu X.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Xiangpeng","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102437"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36731321700","authid":"36731321700","authname":"Liu S.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Shuai","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55235086700","authid":"55235086700","authname":"Yan F.","surname":"Yan","given-name":"Fenggang","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56194275400","authid":"56194275400","authname":"Wang J.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Jun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]}],"authkeywords":"Matrix reconstruction | Quaternion beamforming | Steering vector mismatch | Strong desired signal","source-id":"29708","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85086847647"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85086847647?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85086847647&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85086847647&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85086847647","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85086847647","eid":"2-s2.0-85086847647","dc:title":"Camera Pose Estimation Based on Quaternion from Least Feature Points","dc:creator":"Hou P.G.","prism:publicationName":"Jiliang Xuebao/Acta Metrologica Sinica","prism:issn":"10001158","prism:volume":"41","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"551-557","prism:coverDate":"2020-05-28","prism:coverDisplayDate":"28 May 2020","prism:doi":"10.3969/j.issn.1000-1158.2020.05.07","dc:description":"In order to solve the problem of camera pose estimation, a algorithm based on quaternion from least feature points was proposed.

Preliminary results suggest that the proposed scheme is secure, while allowing to deal with all color channels in a holistic manner and take into account possible interactions between them.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031482","afid":"60031482","affilname":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco","affiliation-city":"Recife","affiliation-country":"Brazil"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204723461","authid":"57204723461","authname":"Da Silva L.C.","surname":"Da Silva","given-name":"Luiz C.","initials":"L.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031482"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56401866400","authid":"56401866400","authname":"De Oliveira Neto J.R.","surname":"De Oliveira Neto","given-name":"José R.","initials":"J.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031482"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/22433665200","authid":"22433665200","authname":"Lima J.B.","surname":"Lima","given-name":"Juliano B.","initials":"J.B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031482"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image encryption | Fourier number transform | Quaternion Fourier transform","article-number":"9054714","source-id":"110544","fund-acr":"CNPq","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089212771"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089212771?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85089212771&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85089212771&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089212771","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85089212771","eid":"2-s2.0-85089212771","dc:title":"Multi-Layer Content Interaction Through Quaternion Product for Visual Question Answering","dc:creator":"Shi L.","prism:publicationName":"ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - Proceedings","prism:issn":"15206149","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781509066315"}],"prism:volume":"2020-May","prism:pageRange":"4412-4416","prism:coverDate":"2020-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May 2020","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICASSP40776.2020.9053595","dc:description":"Multi-modality fusion technologies have greatly improved the performance of neural network-based Video Description/Caption, Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Audio Visual Scene-aware Dialog (AVSD) over the recent years. Most previous approaches only explore the last layers of multiple layer feature fusion while omitting the importance of intermediate layers. To solve the issue for the intermediate layers, we propose an efficient Quaternion Block Network (QBN) to learn interaction not only for the last layer but also for all intermediate layers simultaneously. In our proposed QBN, we use the holistic text features to guide the update of visual features. In the meantime, Hamilton quaternion products can efficiently perform information flow from higher layers to lower layers for both visual and text modalities. The evaluation results show our QBN improve the performance on VQA 2.0, furthermore surpasses the approach using large scale BERT or visual BERT pre-trained models. Extensive ablation study has been carried out to examine the influence of each proposed module in this study.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016930","afid":"60016930","affilname":"Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003398","afid":"60003398","affilname":"Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories","affiliation-city":"Cambridge","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002798","afid":"60002798","affilname":"Chinese University of Hong Kong","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/123289324","afid":"123289324","affilname":"Rutgers University","affiliation-city":"Wayne","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57220943263","authid":"57220943263","authname":"Shi L.","surname":"Shi","given-name":"Lei","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016930"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209221629","authid":"57209221629","authname":"Geng S.","surname":"Geng","given-name":"Shijie","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"123289324"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23089235800","authid":"23089235800","authname":"Shuang K.","surname":"Shuang","given-name":"Kai","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016930"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006734080","authid":"7006734080","authname":"Hori C.","surname":"Hori","given-name":"Chiori","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003398"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204043583","authid":"57204043583","authname":"Liu S.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Songxiang","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002798"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204294274","authid":"57204294274","authname":"Gao P.","surname":"Gao","given-name":"Peng","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002798"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402030114","authid":"7402030114","authname":"Su S.","surname":"Su","given-name":"Sen","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016930"}]}],"authkeywords":"co-attention | multi-layer interaction | quaternion product | representation learning | self-attention | Visual question answering","article-number":"9053595","source-id":"110544","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61921003","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85087382891"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85087382891?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85087382891&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85087382891&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85087382891","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85087382891","eid":"2-s2.0-85087382891","dc:title":"Control of maneuvering fixed wing UAVs","dc:creator":"Bodo Z.","prism:publicationName":"SACI 2020 - IEEE 14th International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics, Proceedings","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781728173764"}],"prism:pageRange":"65-70","prism:coverDate":"2020-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May 2020","prism:doi":"10.1109/SACI49304.2020.9118815","dc:description":"The paper deals with the attitude and altitude control of maneuvering fixed wing UAVs. A velocity damping component was separated in the aircraft dynamic model supporting the stability. Beside Euler angles, an alternative attitude control method was elaborated using quaternion based backstepping control (BSC) in the body frame. A reference signal design method was developed for UAVs that can smoothly connect straight line, circle arc and spiral motion sections for maneuvers. The fusion of BSC and dynamic inversion based attitude and altitude control was elaborated for which the controller parameters can be easily determined. The simulation system for testing the algorithms shows acceptable precision.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030035","afid":"60030035","affilname":"Budapest University of Technology and Economics","affiliation-city":"Budapest","affiliation-country":"Hungary"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189050819","authid":"57189050819","authname":"Bodo Z.","surname":"Bodo","given-name":"Zsofia","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030035"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701694668","authid":"6701694668","authname":"Lantos B.","surname":"Lantos","given-name":"Bela","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030035"}]}],"authkeywords":"Airplane | Backstepping control | Euler angles | Fixed-wing UAV | Maneuver design | Quaternion | Simulation experiments | Smooth connection | Velocity control","article-number":"9118815","source-id":"21101012590","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85085290332"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85085290332?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85085290332&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85085290332&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0022073620301308"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85085290332","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85085290332","eid":"2-s2.0-85085290332","dc:title":"Biomarkers of pre-existing risk of Torsade de Pointes under Sotalol treatment","dc:creator":"Cruces P.D.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Electrocardiology","prism:issn":"00220736","prism:eIssn":"15328430","prism:volume":"60","prism:pageRange":"177-183","prism:coverDate":"2020-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May - June 2020","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2020.04.011","pii":"S0022073620301308","dc:description":"Introduction: Antiarrhythmic drugs therapies are currently going through a turning point. The high risk that exists during the treatments has led to an ongoing search for new non-invasive toxicity risk biomarkers. Methods: We propose the use of spatial biomarkers obtained through the quaternion algebra, evaluating the dynamics of the cardiac electrical vector in a non-invasive way in order to detect abnormal changes in ventricular heterogeneity. In groups of patients with and without history of Torsade de Pointes undergoing a Sotalol challenge, we compute the radius and the linear and angular velocities of QRS complex and T-wave loops. From these signals we extract significant features in order to compute a risk patient classifier. Results: Using machine learning techniques and statistical analysis, the combinations of few indices reach a pair of sensitivity/specificity of 100%/100% when separating patients with arrhythmogenic substrate. Several biomarkers not only measure drug-induced changes significantly but also observe differences in at-risk patients outperforming current standards. Discussion: Alternative biomarkers were able to describe pre-existing risk of patients. Given the high levels of significance and performance, these results could contribute to a better understanding of the torsadogenic substrate and to the safe development of drug therapies.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60066463","afid":"60066463","affilname":"Instituto Argentino de Matematica","affiliation-city":"Buenos Aires","affiliation-country":"Argentina"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023955","afid":"60023955","affilname":"Jozef Stefan Institute","affiliation-city":"Ljubljana","affiliation-country":"Slovenia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001563","afid":"60001563","affilname":"Universidad de Buenos Aires","affiliation-city":"Buenos Aires","affiliation-country":"Argentina"}],"pubmed-id":"32464371","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56562887200","authid":"56562887200","authname":"Cruces P.D.","surname":"Cruces","given-name":"Pablo Daniel","initials":"P.D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001563"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60066463"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24280642600","authid":"24280642600","authname":"Torkar D.","surname":"Torkar","given-name":"Drago","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023955"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602348313","authid":"6602348313","authname":"Arini P.D.","surname":"Arini","given-name":"Pedro David","initials":"P.D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001563"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60066463"}]}],"authkeywords":"Antiarrhytmic drugs | Cardiac electrical vector | Proarrhythmic side effects | Quaternion theory","source-id":"23855","fund-acr":"CONICET","fund-no":"PICT 2145-2016","fund-sponsor":"Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
