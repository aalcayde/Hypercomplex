In particular, there exists a great demand on a mobile motion capture system that enables people to monitor their health condition and to practice sport postures anywhere at any time. The motion capture systems with infrared or vision cameras, however, require a special setting, which hinders their application to a mobile system. In this paper, a mobile three-dimensional motion capture system is developed based on inertial sensors and smart shoes. Sensor signals are measured and processed by a mobile computer; thus, the proposed system enables the analysis and diagnosis of postures during outdoor sports, as well as indoor activities. The measured signals are transformed into quaternion to avoid the Gimbal lock effect. In order to improve the precision of the proposed motion capture system in an open and outdoor space, a frequency-adaptive sensor fusion method and a kinematic model are utilized to construct the whole body motion in real-time. The reference point is continuously updated by smart shoes that measure the ground reaction forces. © 2013 by ASME.","citedby-count":"24","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60094206","afid":"60094206","affilname":"LG Electronics, Korea","affiliation-city":"Seoul","affiliation-country":"South Korea"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018257","afid":"60018257","affilname":"Sogang University","affiliation-city":"Seoul","affiliation-country":"South Korea"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55561892000","authid":"55561892000","authname":"Jung P.","surname":"Jung","given-name":"Pyeong Gook","initials":"P.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018257"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8709753900","authid":"8709753900","authname":"Oh S.","surname":"Oh","given-name":"Sehoon","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018257"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55561537400","authid":"55561537400","authname":"Lim G.","surname":"Lim","given-name":"Gukchan","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60094206"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24332189800","authid":"24332189800","authname":"Kong K.","surname":"Kong","given-name":"Kyoungchul","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018257"}]}],"article-number":"011002","source-id":"21141","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84884394162"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84884394162?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84884394162&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84884394162&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0165168413003186"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84884394162","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84884394162","eid":"2-s2.0-84884394162","dc:title":"Uncertainty principles for hypercomplex signals in the linear canonical transform domains","dc:creator":"Yang Y.","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing","prism:issn":"01651684","prism:volume":"95","prism:pageRange":"67-75","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2014","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.sigpro.2013.08.008","pii":"S0165168413003186","dc:description":"Linear canonical transforms (LCTs) are a family of integral transforms with wide application in optical, acoustical, electromagnetic, and other wave propagation problems.

We explore the extension of these ideas to signals with complex-valued samples, using a quaternion-valued equivalent of the analytic signal obtained from a one-sided quaternion Fourier transform which we refer to as the hypercomplex representation of the complex signal. We discuss its derivation and properties and show how to obtain a complex envelope and a real phase from it. A classical result in the case of real signals is that an amplitude modulated signal may be decomposed into its envelope and carrier using the analytic signal provided that the modulating signal has frequency content not overlapping with that of the carrier. We show that this idea extends to the complex case, provided that the complex signal modulates an orthonormal complex exponential.

Most existing video quality metrics either focus primarily on capturing spatial artifacts in the video signal, or are designed to assess only grayscale video thereby ignoring important chrominance information. In this paper, on the basis of the top-down visual analysis of cognitive understanding and video features, we propose and develop a novel full-reference perceptual video assessment technique that accepts visual information inputs in the form of a quaternion consisting of contour, color and temporal information. Because of the more important role of chrominance information in the \"border-to-surface\" mechanism at early stages of cognitive visual processing, our new metric takes into account the chrominance information rather than the luminance information utilized in conventional video quality assessment. Our perceptual quaternion model employs singular value decomposition (SVD) and utilizes the human visual psychological features for SVD block weighting to better reflect perceptual focus and interest. Our major contributions include: a new perceptual quaternion that takes chrominance as one spatial feature, and temporal information to model motion or changes across adjacent frames; a three-level video quality measure to reflect visual psychology; and the two weighting methods based on entropy and frame correlation. Our experimental validation on the video quality experts' group (VQEG) Phase I FR-TV test dataset demonstrated that our new assessment metric outperforms PSNR, SSIM, PVQM (P8) and has high correlation with perceived video quality. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60099659","afid":"60099659","affilname":"School of Computer Science","affiliation-city":"Sydney","affiliation-country":"Australia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031419","afid":"60031419","affilname":"Ningbo University","affiliation-city":"Ningbo","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014556","afid":"60014556","affilname":"Sichuan Normal University","affiliation-city":"Chengdu","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55876066500","authid":"55876066500","authname":"Li J.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Junli","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014556"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9639442200","authid":"9639442200","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiuying","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60099659"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57857808700","authid":"57857808700","authname":"Li G.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Gang","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031419"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55495321300","authid":"55495321300","authname":"Zhang F.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Fuqiang","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031419"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401981167","authid":"7401981167","authname":"Feng D.","surname":"Feng","given-name":"David","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60099659"}]}],"authkeywords":"Chrominance | Cognitive analysis | Edge | Quaternion | Singular value decomposition | Temporal correlation | Top-down framework | Video quality assessment","source-id":"25627","fund-no":"2013SZ0085","fund-sponsor":"Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
