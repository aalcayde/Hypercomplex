Optimal stimulus for such a field is not the edge or a slit of a definite orientation but rather a complex stimulus consisting of one, two, three or more slits. For any particular RF it is possible to find an optimal stimulus evoking a maximal response. The greater the number of slits in optimal stimulus the narrower are mean widths of slits and corresponding intervals between the slits. The effective area of stimulus is independent of the number of slits in it and is equal, on an average, to 2.6° (in cross-section). In a column made up from neurons of uniform orientation, the RFs with optimal stimuli consisting of the different number of slits were found to exist. These data allow VCRFs to be considered as narrow-band filters of spatial frequencies serving to execute piece-wise Fourier analysis of image. The network comprising such neurons is also able to extract the border between textures. The nervous network of this kind can perform the first step in image recognition i.e. the extraction of figure from its background. The comparative characteristics of organization of inhibitory zones of RFs of various levels have been obtained. In RFs of LGB the inhibition of response appears only at simultaneous stimulation of the inhibitory and excitatory zones of the field. In VCRF stimulation of the inhibitory zone is effective after a long time (about some hundred msec) after onset of stimulation of the excitatory zone. In complex VCRFs increase in width of slit, stimulating the inhibitory zone, beyond optimal size results in diminishing the inhibitory effect; this phenomena has not been observed in simple RFs. The functional and the structural models of VCRFs have been considered. © 1973.","citedby-count":"72","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021712","afid":"60021712","affilname":"Pavlov Institute of Physiology, Russian Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Saint Petersburg","affiliation-country":"Russian Federation"}],"pubmed-id":"4746987","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006669361","authid":"7006669361","authname":"Glezer V.","surname":"Glezer","given-name":"V.
