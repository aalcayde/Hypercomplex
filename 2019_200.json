The proposed method makes a combination between local and global approaches. Local features are obtained at patches level using a Module Local Binary Patterns and the comparison between feature vectors (module and phase). The salient object is obtained by a weighted combination of salient maps where a function of center-bias and refinement is applied. To verify the effectiveness of our method, this is validated using the mean absolute error metric in the ECSSD-1000 and DUT-OMRON datasets and compared with others state of the art algorithms. A statistical analysis is applied to the results to obtain the statistical significance among color spaces with the method of Wilcoxon signed test.

The global positioning system (GPS) is a popular positioning system, which is mainly efficient for outdoor environments. In indoor scenarios, GPS signal reception is weak. Therefore, achieving good position estimation accuracy is a challenge. To overcome this challenge, it is necessary to utilize other position-estimation systems for indoor localization. However, other existing indoor localization systems, especially based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor data, still face challenges such as accumulated errors from sensors and external magnetic field effects. This paper proposes a position-estimation algorithm that uses the combined features of the accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope data from an IMU sensor for position estimation. In this paper, we first estimate the pitch and roll values based on a fusion of accelerometer and gyroscope sensor values. The estimated pitch values are used for step detection. The step lengths are estimated by using the pitching amplitude. The heading of the pedestrian is estimated by the fusion of magnetometer and gyroscope sensor values. Finally, the position is estimated based on the step length and heading information. The proposed pitch-based step detection algorithm achieves 2.5% error as compared with acceleration-based step detection approaches. The heading estimation proposed in this paper achieves a mean heading error of 4.72° as compared with the azimuth- A nd magnetometer-based approaches. The experimental results show that the proposed position-estimation algorithm achieves a high position accuracy that significantly outperforms that of conventional estimation methods used for validation in this paper.","citedby-count":"110","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071676","afid":"60071676","affilname":"Makerere University","affiliation-city":"Kampala","affiliation-country":"Uganda"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012704","afid":"60012704","affilname":"Kyungpook National University","affiliation-city":"Daegu","affiliation-country":"South Korea"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205504085","authid":"57205504085","orcid":"0000-0002-6729-5478","authname":"Poulose A.","surname":"Poulose","given-name":"Alwin","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012704"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190814517","authid":"57190814517","authname":"Eyobu O.","surname":"Eyobu","given-name":"Odongo Steven","initials":"O.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012704"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60071676"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403219442","authid":"7403219442","orcid":"0000-0002-7769-0236","authname":"Han D.","surname":"Han","given-name":"Dong Seog","initials":"D.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012704"}]}],"authkeywords":"Android-based smartphone | heading estimation | indoor navigation | Indoor positioning system (IPS) | Kalman filter | pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) | quaternion | sensor fusion","article-number":"8606925","source-id":"21100374601","fund-acr":"IITP","fund-no":"R7124-16-0004","fund-sponsor":"Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85060706105"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85060706105?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85060706105&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85060706105&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85060706105","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85060706105","eid":"2-s2.0-85060706105","dc:title":"13th EAI International Conference on Communications and Networking in China, ChinaCom 2018","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering, LNICST","prism:issn":"18678211","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783030061609"}],"prism:volume":"262","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 71 papers.

For filtering of gray scale images, the Fourier transform in ℝ 2 is an important tool which converts the image from spatial domain to frequency domain, then by applying filtering mask filtering is done. To filter color images, a new approach is implemented recently which uses hypercomplex numbers (called Quaternions) to represent color images and uses Quaternion-Fourier transform for filtering. The quaternion Fourier transform has been widely employed in the colour image processing. The use of quaternions allow the analysis of color images as vector fields, rather than as color separated components. In this paper we mainly focus on the theoretical part of the Quaternion Fourier transform: the real Paley-Wiener theorems for the Quaternion-Fourier transform on ℝ 2 for Quaternion-valued Schwartz functions and L p -functions, which generalizes the recent results of real Paley-Wiener theorems for scalar- and quaternion-valued L 2 -functions.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005465","afid":"60005465","affilname":"University of Electronic Science and Technology of China","affiliation-city":"Chengdu","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/41961499600","authid":"41961499600","authname":"Li S.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Shanshan","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55419504900","authid":"55419504900","authname":"Leng J.","surname":"Leng","given-name":"Jinsong","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13408015800","authid":"13408015800","authname":"Fei M.","surname":"Fei","given-name":"Minggang","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]}],"authkeywords":"Paley-Wiener theorem Quaternion-Fourier transform | Quaternion analysis","source-id":"21100220348","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"11571083","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85060387923"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85060387923?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85060387923&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85060387923&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85060387923","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85060387923","eid":"2-s2.0-85060387923","dc:title":"Quaternion entropy for analysis of gait data","dc:creator":"Szczȩsna A.","prism:publicationName":"Entropy","prism:eIssn":"10994300","prism:volume":"21","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 January 2019","prism:doi":"10.3390/e21010079","dc:description":"Nonlinear dynamical analysis is a powerful approach to understanding biological systems. One of the most used metrics of system complexities is the Kolmogorov entropy. Long input signals without noise are required for the calculation, which are very hard to obtain in real situations. Techniques allowing the estimation of entropy directly from time signals are statistics like approximate and sample entropy. Based on that, the new measurement for quaternion signal is introduced. This work presents an example of application of a nonlinear time series analysis by using the new quaternion, approximate entropy to analyse human gait kinematic data. The quaternion entropy was applied to analyse the quaternion signal which represents the segments orientations in time during the human gait. The research was aimed at the assessment of the influence of both walking speed and ground slope on the gait control during treadmill walking. Gait data was obtained by the optical motion capture system.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009081","afid":"60009081","affilname":"Silesian University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Gliwice","affiliation-country":"Poland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23089634300","authid":"23089634300","authname":"Szczȩsna A.","surname":"Szczȩsna","given-name":"Agnieszka","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009081"}]}],"authkeywords":"Approximate entropy | Gait data | Motion data analysis | Quaternion entropy","article-number":"79","source-id":"13715","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85060239641"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85060239641?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85060239641&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85060239641&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85060239641","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85060239641","eid":"2-s2.0-85060239641","dc:title":"Correlative feature selection for multimodal medical image fusion through QWT","dc:creator":"Krishna Chaithanya J.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computational Vision and Biomechanics","prism:issn":"22129391","prism:eIssn":"22129413","prism:volume":"30","prism:pageRange":"1427-1440","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-00665-5_133","dc:description":"A novel image fusion technique is proposed in this paper to achieve an efficient and informative image by combining multiple medical images into one.

QWT decomposes the source images first and then the feature selection process obtains an optimal feature set from the low-frequency (LF) as well as high-frequency (HF) sub-bands. The obtained optimal feature sets of both LF sub-bands and HF sub-bands are fused through low-frequency fusion rule and high-frequency fusion rule and the fused LF and HF coefficients are processed through IQWT to obtain a fused image. Various models of medical image are processed in the simulation and the performance is evaluated through various performance metrics and compared with conventional approaches to show the robustness and efficiency of proposed fusion framework.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60109977","afid":"60109977","affilname":"Vardhaman College of Engineering","affiliation-city":"Hyderabad","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60107604","afid":"60107604","affilname":"Sri Venkateswara University College Of Engineering","affiliation-city":"Tirupati","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"ch","subtypeDescription":"Book Chapter","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211869267","authid":"57211869267","authname":"Krishna Chaithanya J.","surname":"Krishna Chaithanya","given-name":"J.","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60109977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58071849600","authid":"58071849600","authname":"Kumar G.A.E.S.","surname":"Kumar","given-name":"G.

Inertial sensors open the door to the development of low-cost, wearable, and easy-to-use breathing-monitoring systems. The present paper proposes a new posture-independent processing algorithm for breath-by-breath extraction of breathing temporal parameters from chest-wall inclination change signals measured using inertial measurement units. An important step of the processing algorithm is dimension reduction (DR) that allows the extraction of a single respiratory signal starting from 4-component quaternion data. Three different DR methods are proposed and compared in terms of accuracy of breathing temporal parameter estimation, in a group of healthy subjects, considering different breathing patterns and different postures; optoelectronic plethysmography was used as reference system. In this study, we found that the method based on PCA-fusion of the four quaternion components provided the best f B estimation performance in terms of mean absolute errors (<2 breaths/min), correlation (r > 0.963) and Bland–Altman Analysis, outperforming the other two methods, based on the selection of a single quaternion component, identified on the basis of spectral analysis; particularly, in supine position, results provided by PCA-based method were even better than those obtained with the ideal quaternion component, determined a posteriori as the one providing the minimum estimation error. The proposed algorithm and system were able to successfully reconstruct the respiration-induced movement, and to accurately determine the respiratory rate in an automatic, position-independent manner.","citedby-count":"38","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60083538","afid":"60083538","affilname":"IRCCS Eugenio Medea","affiliation-city":"Bosisio Parini","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023256","afid":"60023256","affilname":"Politecnico di Milano","affiliation-city":"Milan","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"pubmed-id":"30591694","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57144420700","authid":"57144420700","authname":"Cesareo A.","surname":"Cesareo","given-name":"Ambra","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205236831","authid":"57205236831","authname":"Previtali Y.","surname":"Previtali","given-name":"Ylenia","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26653960400","authid":"26653960400","authname":"Biffi E.","surname":"Biffi","given-name":"Emilia","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60083538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006361013","authid":"7006361013","authname":"Aliverti A.","surname":"Aliverti","given-name":"Andrea","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023256"}]}],"authkeywords":"Biomedical signal processing | Optoelectronic plethysmography | Principal component analysis | Respiratory monitoring | Wearable biomedical sensors | Wireless sensor network","article-number":"88","source-id":"130124","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059029381"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059029381?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059029381&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85059029381&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059029381","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85059029381","eid":"2-s2.0-85059029381","dc:title":"Feature extraction of color images using quaternion moments","dc:creator":"Hosny K.M.","prism:publicationName":"Studies in Computational Intelligence","prism:issn":"1860949X","prism:volume":"804","prism:pageRange":"141-167","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-03000-1_6","dc:description":"Color images play an essential role in computer vision systems where colors are useful information.

A series of numerical experiments are performed using different parameters to assess the performance of extracted features using different quaternion moments.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60273131","afid":"60273131","affilname":"Faculty of Science","affiliation-city":"Asyut","affiliation-country":"Egypt"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003593","afid":"60003593","affilname":"Zagazig University","affiliation-city":"Zagazig","affiliation-country":"Egypt"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"ch","subtypeDescription":"Book Chapter","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205214086","authid":"57205214086","authname":"Hosny K.M.","surname":"Hosny","given-name":"Khalid M.","initials":"K.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003593"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205229124","authid":"57205229124","authname":"Darwish M.M.","surname":"Darwish","given-name":"Mohamed M.","initials":"M.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60273131"}]}],"source-id":"4900152708","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85057117479"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85057117479?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85057117479&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85057117479&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85057117479","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85057117479","eid":"2-s2.0-85057117479","dc:title":"The extraction and application of the color texture feature based on quaternion gabor","dc:creator":"Meng B.","prism:publicationName":"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies","prism:issn":"21903018","prism:eIssn":"21903026","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783030037444"}],"prism:volume":"109","prism:pageRange":"108-116","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-03745-1_14","dc:description":"The Gabor is a standard means to extract texture feature of image, besides it was used to image classification and image segmentation far and wide. But, traditional methods that extracting texture feature always ignoring the color information and losing dependency between one channel and others. That makes it difficult to remain the raw information of image. To address above problems, this paper proposed a quaternion Gabor method to extract color texture feature. Firstly, according to the traditional Gabor filter and quaternion Euler’s formula, the quaternion Gabor filter was determined. Then, the multi-scale, multi-direction color texture image was obtained by quaternion Gabor convolution algorithm. Finally, the Tamura feature was extracted from the feature image to test the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method can retain coarseness, contrast and directionality to a great extent, the feature image if better than traditional Gabor feature image and LBP feature image in retaining the Tamura texture feature. Besides, the quaternion Gabor can also use in image enhancement. The second experiment shows the application on image enhancement.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073562","afid":"60073562","affilname":"Northeast Electric Power University","affiliation-city":"Jilin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55729910600","authid":"55729910600","authname":"Meng B.","surname":"Meng","given-name":"Bo","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073562"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073562"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57008295100","authid":"57008295100","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiaolin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073562"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201288572","authid":"57201288572","authname":"Liu X.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Xuejun","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073562"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16235267400","authid":"16235267400","authname":"Xia L.","surname":"Xia","given-name":"Linlin","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073562"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073562"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15029990500","authid":"15029990500","authname":"Deng G.","surname":"Deng","given-name":"Guannan","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073562"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073562"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57197708988","authid":"57197708988","authname":"Jiao S.","surname":"Jiao","given-name":"Shengxi","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073562"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073562"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color texture | Feature extracting | Quaternion Gabor filter | Tamura","source-id":"21100204111","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055047247"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055047247?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85055047247&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85055047247&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055047247","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85055047247","eid":"2-s2.0-85055047247","dc:title":"Special Numbers, Special Quaternions and Special Symbol Elements","dc:creator":"Savin D.","prism:publicationName":"Studies in Systems, Decision and Control","prism:issn":"21984182","prism:eIssn":"21984190","prism:volume":"179","prism:pageRange":"417-430","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-00084-4_23","dc:description":"Most mathematical notions have connections with real life.

Generally, researchers use neuron models that are based on summation (linear), product (linear) or radial basis (nonlinear) aggregation for the processing of synapses, to construct multi-layered feed-forward neural networks, but all these neuron models and their corresponding neural networks have their advantages or disadvantages. The multi-layered network generally uses for accomplishing the global approximation of input–output mapping but sometimes getting stuck into local minima, while the nonlinear radial basis function (RBF) network is based on exponentially decaying that uses for local approximation to input–output mapping. Their advantages and disadvantages motivated to design two new artificial neuron models based on compensatory aggregation functions in the quaternionic domain. The net internal potentials of these neuron models are developed with the compositions of basic summation (linear) and radial basis (nonlinear) operations on quaternionic-valued input signals. The neuron models based on these aggregation functions ensure faster convergence, better training, and prediction accuracy. The learning and generalization capabilities of these neurons are verified through various three-dimensional transformations and time series predictions as benchmark problems.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010747","afid":"60010747","affilname":"Harcourt Butler Technical University","affiliation-city":"Kanpur","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57213856119","authid":"57213856119","authname":"Kumar S.","surname":"Kumar","given-name":"Sushil","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010747"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24469034100","authid":"24469034100","authname":"Tripathi B.K.","surname":"Tripathi","given-name":"Bipin Kumar","initials":"B.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010747"}]}],"authkeywords":"3D transformation | Quaternionic back-propagation | Quaternionic multi-layer perceptron | Time series prediction","source-id":"21100820602","fund-acr":"DRDO","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Defence Research and Development Organisation","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85052828816"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85052828816?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85052828816&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85052828816&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85052828816","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85052828816","eid":"2-s2.0-85052828816","dc:title":"Secure quaternion feistel cipher for DICOM images","dc:creator":"Dzwonkowski M.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","prism:issn":"10577149","prism:volume":"28","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"371-380","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"January 2019","prism:doi":"10.1109/TIP.2018.2868388","dc:description":"An improved and extended version of a quaternion-based lossless encryption technique for digital image and communication on medicine (DICOM) images is proposed.

A new and more secure key generation scheme based on quaternion Julia sets is utilized. We also introduce both-sided modular matrix multiplications for the encryption and decryption processes. The proposed S-QFC algorithm eliminates the major security flaws of its predecessor while maintaining high computation speed in comparison to other algorithms originally embedded in DICOM (i.e., advanced encryption standard and triple data encryption standard).

In addition, a precision clock is needed to provide current time and synchronize the data from the star sensor and the inclinometer. Base on principle of star sensor and inclinometer, the measurement model of the system is established and error analysis is carried out. It is noticed that the systematic error caused by the misalignment of the star sensor and the inclinometer influences the positioning accuracy significantly. In order to eliminate this systematic error, a calibration method based on QUEST (QUaternion ESTimator) is proposed to obtain the misalignment matrix and refine measurement model.

Compared with discrete wavelet transform (DWT), contourlet wavelet transform, and local binary patterns, CQWT processes a color image as a unit, and so, it can provide more forensics information to identify the photograph (PG) and computer generated (CG) images by considering the quaternion magnitude and phase measures. Meanwhile, two novel quaternion central moments for color images, i.e., quaternion skewness and kurtosis, are proposed to extract forensics features. In the condition of the same statistical model as Farid's model, the CQWT can boost the performance of the existing identification models. Compared with Farid's model and Li's model in 7500 PG and 7500 CG, the quaternion statistical features show a better classification performance. Results in the comparative experiments show that the classification accuracy of the CQWT improves by 19% more than Farid's model, and the quaternion features approximately improve by 2% more than the traditional.","citedby-count":"55","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143","afid":"60064143","affilname":"Nanjing University of Information Science &amp; Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022904","afid":"60022904","affilname":"New Jersey Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Newark","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/115285558","afid":"115285558","affilname":"State Key Laboratory of Mathematical Engineering and Advanced Computing","affiliation-city":"Zhengzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192930875","authid":"57192930875","orcid":"0000-0002-9366-5671","authname":"Wang J.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Jinwei","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"115285558"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192070035","authid":"57192070035","authname":"Li T.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Ting","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8976166200","authid":"8976166200","orcid":"0000-0001-6062-2950","authname":"Luo X.","surname":"Luo","given-name":"Xiangyang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"115285558"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404964736","authid":"7404964736","authname":"Shi Y.Q.","surname":"Shi","given-name":"Yun Qing","initials":"Y.Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022904"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221974224","authid":"57221974224","orcid":"0000-0002-6955-1244","authname":"Jha S.K.","surname":"Jha","given-name":"Sunil Kr","initials":"S.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]}],"authkeywords":"color image | Color quaternion wavelet transform (CQWT) | forensics | quaternion feature | quaternion statistics","article-number":"8450040","source-id":"26027","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"2018JR0018","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85051694064"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85051694064?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85051694064&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85051694064&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85051694064","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85051694064","eid":"2-s2.0-85051694064","dc:title":"Trimmed median filter for removal of noise from medical image","dc:creator":"Kumar P.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering","prism:issn":"18761100","prism:eIssn":"18761119","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789811082337"}],"prism:volume":"476","prism:pageRange":"201-209","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-981-10-8234-4_18","dc:description":"Medical images are very sensitive in nature. During transmission, noise may be added to the image which affects the performance of the system. Generally, images are affected by speckle, Gaussian, and impulse noise. It is essential to remove the noise present in the image. Filters such as adaptive median filter, decision-based algorithm, modified quaternion vector filter, progressive switching median filter, and decision-based unsymmetrical trimmed variant are used for reduction of impulse noise present in the image. A method has been proposed in this paper for removing impulse noise present in the medical images. This technique uses a nonoverlapping window of size 2 × 2, and processing of image is done at the window level by taking consideration of noise-free pixel present in this window. The proposed filter removes impulse noise effectively from medical images.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60115575","afid":"60115575","affilname":"Cambridge Institute of Technology, Ranchi","affiliation-city":"Ranchi","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026714","afid":"60026714","affilname":"Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra","affiliation-city":"Ranchi","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57220737972","authid":"57220737972","authname":"Kumar P.","surname":"Kumar","given-name":"Pawan","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60115575"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/37048706100","authid":"37048706100","authname":"Chandra M.","surname":"Chandra","given-name":"Mahesh","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026714"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57217984177","authid":"57217984177","authname":"Kumar S.","surname":"Kumar","given-name":"Sanjeev","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60115575"}]}],"authkeywords":"Decision-based algorithm | Decision-based unsymmetric trimmed median filter | Decision-based unsymmetrical trimmed variant filter | Modified quaternion vector filter","source-id":"19700186822","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050718012"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050718012?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85050718012&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85050718012&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050718012","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85050718012","eid":"2-s2.0-85050718012","dc:title":"On 4-dimensional hypercomplex algebras in adaptive signal processing","dc:creator":"Ortolani F.","prism:publicationName":"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies","prism:issn":"21903018","prism:eIssn":"21903026","prism:volume":"102","prism:pageRange":"131-140","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-95098-3_12","dc:description":"The degree of diffusion of hypercomplex algebras in adaptive and non-adaptive filtering research topics is growing faster and faster.

Multiple feature extraction and representation is one of the most important issues in the CBIR. In this paper, we propose a new CBIR method based on an efficient integration of texture and shape features. The texture features are extracted on the decomposed images processed by the optimal non-subsampled shearlet transform (NSST), and are represented by the high-frequency sub-band coefficients, which can be modeled by Bessel K Form (BKF) distribution; the shape features are represented by low-order quaternion polar harmonic transforms (QPHTs). The two kinds of features are then integrated by a weighted distance measurement, where Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD) and Euclidean distance (ED) are used for texture and shape features respectively. The integration of shape and texture information provides a robust feature set for image retrieval. Experimental results on standard benchmarks show significant improvements on retrieval performance using the proposed method compared with previous state-of-the-art methods.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032758","afid":"60032758","affilname":"Liaoning Technical University","affiliation-city":"Fuxin","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017010","afid":"60017010","affilname":"Liaoning Normal University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010080","afid":"60010080","affilname":"Nanjing University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56604552600","authid":"56604552600","authname":"Liu Y.N.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Yu Nan","initials":"Y.N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010080"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36620714700","authid":"36620714700","authname":"Zhang S.S.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Shan Shan","initials":"S.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010080"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36824201500","authid":"36824201500","authname":"Sang Y.","surname":"Sang","given-name":"Yu","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032758"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57077942700","authid":"57077942700","authname":"Wang S.M.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Si Miao","initials":"S.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]}],"authkeywords":"BKF distribution | Content-based image retrieval | Non-subsampled shearlet transform | Quaternion polar harmonic transforms","source-id":"25627","fund-no":"61472187","fund-sponsor":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049552868"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049552868?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85049552868&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85049552868&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049552868","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85049552868","eid":"2-s2.0-85049552868","dc:title":"Copy-move forgery detection based on compact color content descriptor and Delaunay triangle matching","dc:creator":"Wang X.y.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","prism:issn":"13807501","prism:eIssn":"15737721","prism:volume":"78","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"2311-2344","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 January 2019","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11042-018-6354-1","dc:description":"Copy-move (region duplication) is one of the most common types of image forgeries, in which at least one part of an image is copied and pasted onto another area of the same image. The main aims of the copy-move forgery are to overemphasize a concept or conceal objects by duplicating some regions. Keypoint based copy-move forgery detection (CMFD) method extracts image feature points and employs local image features to identify duplicated regions, which exhibits remarkable detection performance with respect to memory requirement, computational cost, and robustness. However, they usually do not work well when the objects are hidden in smooth background areas. Also, the detection and localization accuracy always be lowered because of poor local image feature computation. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the detection and localization of copy-move forgeries, which is based on color invariance SIFER (Scale-invariant feature detector with error resilience) and FQRHFMs (Fast quaternion radial harmonic Fourier moments). Firstly, the original forgery image is segmented into nonoverlapping and nearly uniform superpixel blocks, and the stable keypoints are extracted adaptively from each superpixel block by incorporating the superpixel contents and color invariance SIFER. Secondly, a set of connected Delaunay triangles is constructed using the extracted image keypoints, and suitable local image feature for each Delaunay triangle is computed by using FQRHFMs and gradient entropy. Thirdly, the local image features and coherency sensitive hashing (CSH) are utilized to match quickly the Delaunay triangles. Finally, the falsely matched Delaunay triangles are removed by employing dense linear fitting (DLF), and the duplicated regions are localized using optimized zero mean normalized cross-correlation (ZNCC) measure. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed copy-move forgery detection scheme, in which encouraging results validate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017010","afid":"60017010","affilname":"Liaoning Normal University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972239800","authid":"34972239800","authname":"Wang X.y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiang yang","initials":"X.y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195237384","authid":"57195237384","authname":"Jiao L.x.","surname":"Jiao","given-name":"Li xian","initials":"L.x.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201188158","authid":"57201188158","authname":"Wang X.b.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xue bing","initials":"X.b.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972350300","authid":"34972350300","authname":"Yang H.y.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Hong ying","initials":"H.y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16205443400","authid":"16205443400","authname":"Niu P.p.","surname":"Niu","given-name":"Pan pan","initials":"P.p.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]}],"authkeywords":"Coherency sensitive hashing | Color invariance SIFER | Copy-move forgery detection | FQRHFMs | Optimized ZNCC","source-id":"25627","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61272416","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048668110"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048668110?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85048668110&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85048668110&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048668110","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85048668110","eid":"2-s2.0-85048668110","dc:title":"Quaternion-valued feedforward neural network based time series forecast","dc:creator":"Li X.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering","prism:issn":"18761100","prism:eIssn":"18761119","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789811065705"}],"prism:volume":"463","prism:pageRange":"1614-1619","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-981-10-6571-2_196","dc:description":"Currently, the quaternion-valued feedforward neural network (QFNN) has been proposed for image compression and has a more superior performance than the real-valued feedforward neural network (FNN). However, the used quaternion activation function is a split quaternion function, thus it may not preserve the cross-information within the components of the data and for time series forecast, the established model is a strictly linear model which may not be appropriate for noncircular quaternion-valued signal processing. In this paper, a fully quaternion activation function is employed to design the QFNN and an augmented QFNN (AQFNN) is proposed. They are derived by using recent studies in the augmented quaternion statistics and the HR-calculus. With the augmented quaternion statistics, the AQFNN can process quaternion-valued noncircular signals, effectively. Simulations on both benchmark circular and noncircular quaternion-valued signals, and real-world quaternion-valued signals support the analysis.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195694837","authid":"57195694837","authname":"Li X.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Xiaodong","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404978169","authid":"7404978169","authname":"Yu C.","surname":"Yu","given-name":"Changjun","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102864861","authid":"7102864861","authname":"Su F.","surname":"Su","given-name":"Fulin","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189631950","authid":"57189631950","authname":"Liu A.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Aijun","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192909650","authid":"57192909650","authname":"Yang X.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Xuguang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]}],"authkeywords":"Augmented quaternion statistics | FNN | HR-calculus | Noncircular","source-id":"19700186822","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61571157","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047605866"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047605866?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85047605866&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85047605866&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047605866","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85047605866","eid":"2-s2.0-85047605866","dc:title":"Multiple-Model Adaptive Estimation for 3-D and 4-D Signals: A Widely Linear Quaternion Approach","dc:creator":"Xiang M.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","prism:issn":"2162237X","prism:eIssn":"21622388","prism:volume":"30","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"72-84","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"January 2019","prism:doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2829526","dc:description":"Quaternion state estimation techniques have been used in various applications, yet they are only suitable for dynamical systems represented by a single known model. In order to deal with model uncertainty, this paper proposes a class of widely linear quaternion multiple-model adaptive estimation (WL-QMMAE) algorithms based on widely linear quaternion Kalman filters and Bayesian inference. The augmented second-order quaternion statistics is employed to capture complete second-order statistical information in improper quaternion signals. Within the WL-QMMAE framework, a widely linear quaternion interacting multiple-model algorithm is proposed to track time-variant model uncertainty, while a widely linear quaternion static multiple-model algorithm is proposed for time-invariant model uncertainty. A performance analysis of the proposed algorithms shows that, as expected, the WL-QMMAE reduces to semiwidely linear QMMAE for \\mathbb {C}^{\\eta } -improper signals and further reduces to strictly linear QMMAE for proper signals. Simulation results indicate that for improper signals, the proposed WL-QMMAE algorithms exhibit an enhanced performance over their strictly linear counterparts. The effectiveness of the proposed recursive performance analysis algorithm is also validated.","citedby-count":"21","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015150","afid":"60015150","affilname":"Imperial College London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"pubmed-id":"29993725","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189332044","authid":"57189332044","orcid":"0000-0002-0239-3392","authname":"Xiang M.","surname":"Xiang","given-name":"Min","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202251436","authid":"57202251436","authname":"Dees B.","surname":"Dees","given-name":"Bruno Scalzo","initials":"B.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006513328","authid":"7006513328","orcid":"0000-0001-8432-3963","authname":"Mandic D.","surname":"Mandic","given-name":"Danilo P.","initials":"D.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]}],"authkeywords":"Interacting multiple-model (IMM) algorithm | multiple-model adaptive estimation (MMAE) | quaternion Kalman filters | quaternion noncircularity | static multiple-model (SMM) algorithm | widely linear processing","article-number":"8363059","source-id":"21100235616","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85044146552"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85044146552?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85044146552&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85044146552&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0016003218301224"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85044146552","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85044146552","eid":"2-s2.0-85044146552","dc:title":"Chattering-free full-order recursive sliding mode control for finite-time attitude synchronization of rigid spacecraft","dc:creator":"Song Z.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of the Franklin Institute","prism:issn":"00160032","prism:volume":"356","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"998-1020","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"January 2019","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jfranklin.2018.02.013","pii":"S0016003218301224","dc:description":"This paper investigates a quaternion-based finite-time cooperative attitude synchronization and tracking of multiple rigid spacecraft with a virtual leader subject to bounded external disturbances. Firstly, the communication network between followers is assumed to be an undirected graph and every follower can get a direct access to the virtual leader, by using two neighborhood attitude error signals, a novel chattering-free recursive full-order sliding mode control algorithm is proposed such that all follower spacecraft synchronize to the virtual leader in finite time. In the proposed algorithm, the sliding mode surface is constructed by two layers of sliding mode surfaces, which are called as the outer and the inner sliding mode surfaces. To achieve finite-time performance of sliding mode dynamics, the outer sliding mode surface is designed as a terminal sliding mode manifold, and the inner one is designed as a fast nonsingular terminal sliding mode manifold, respectively. Then, to reduce the heavy communication burden, a distributed recursive full-order sliding mode control law is designed by introducing a distributed finite-time sliding mode estimator such that only a subset of the group members has access to the virtual leader. Finally, a numerical example is illustrated to demonstrate the validity of the proposed results.","citedby-count":"38","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016835","afid":"60016835","affilname":"Beijing Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001604","afid":"60001604","affilname":"Ministry of Education China","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14038240100","authid":"14038240100","authname":"Song Z.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Zhuoyue","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001604"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201280326","authid":"57201280326","authname":"Duan C.","surname":"Duan","given-name":"Chao","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001604"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36728577300","authid":"36728577300","authname":"Wang J.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Jianan","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404602027","authid":"7404602027","authname":"Wu Q.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Qinghe","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001604"}]}],"source-id":"27959","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61304026","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
