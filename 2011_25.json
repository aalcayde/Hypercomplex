This paper aims to study such integral transforms from general principles, using 4 different yet equivalent definitions of the classical Fourier transform. This is applied to the so-called Clifford-Fourier transform (see Brackx et al., J. Fourier Anal. Appl. 11:669-681, 2005). The integral kernel of this transform is a particular solution of a system of PDEs in a Clifford algebra, but is, contrary to the classical Fourier transform, not the unique solution. Here we determine an entire class of solutions of this system of PDEs, under certain constraints. For each solution, series expressions in terms of Gegenbauer polynomials and Bessel functions are obtained. This allows to compute explicitly the eigenvalues of the associated integral transforms. In the even-dimensional case, this also yields the inverse transform for each of the solutions. Finally, several properties of the entire class of solutions are proven. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","citedby-count":"33","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033316","afid":"60033316","affilname":"Universiteit Gent","affiliation-city":"Ghent","affiliation-country":"Belgium"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/22134443600","authid":"22134443600","authname":"De Bie H.","surname":"De Bie","given-name":"Hendrik","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033316"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602880592","authid":"6602880592","authname":"De Schepper N.","surname":"De Schepper","given-name":"Nele","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033316"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12758635100","authid":"12758635100","authname":"Sommen F.","surname":"Sommen","given-name":"Frank","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033316"}]}],"authkeywords":"Bessel-Gegenbauer series | Clifford analysis | Fourier transform | Hypercomplex signals","source-id":"23893","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80055072029"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80055072029?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80055072029&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80055072029&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1090780711003077"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80055072029","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:80055072029","eid":"2-s2.0-80055072029","dc:title":"Theory of mirrored time domain sampling for NMR spectroscopy","dc:creator":"Ghosh A.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Magnetic Resonance","prism:issn":"10907807","prism:eIssn":"10960856","prism:volume":"213","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"46-57","prism:coverDate":"2011-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2011","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jmr.2011.08.037","pii":"S1090780711003077","dc:description":"A generalized theory is presented for novel mirrored hypercomplex time domain sampling (MHS) of NMR spectra. It is the salient new feature of MHS that two interferograms are acquired with different directionality of time evolution, that is, one is sampled forward from time t = 0 to the maximal evolution time t max, while the second is sampled backward from t = 0 to -t max. The sampling can be accomplished in a (semi) constant time or non constant-time manner. Subsequently, the two interferograms are linearly combined to yield a complex time domain signal. The manifold of MHS schemes considered here is defined by arbitrary settings of sampling phases ('primary phase shifts') and amplitudes of the two interferograms. It is shown that, for any two given primary phase shifts, the addition theorems of trigonometric functions yield the unique linear combination required to form the complex signal. In the framework of clean absorption mode (CAM) acquisition of NMR spectra being devoid of residual dispersive signal components, 'secondary phase shifts' represent time domain phase errors which are to be eliminated. In contrast, such secondary phase shifts may be introduced by experimental design in order to encode additional NMR parameters, a new class of NMR experiments proposed here. For generalization, it is further considered that secondary phase shifts may depend on primary phase shifts and/or sampling directionality. In order to compare with MHS theory, a correspondingly generalized theory is derived for widely used hypercomplex ('States') sampling (HS). With generalized theory it is shown, first, that previously introduced 'canonical' schemes, characterized by primary phases being multiples of π/4, afford maximal intensity of the desired absorptive signals in the absence of secondary phase shifts, and second, how primary phases can be adjusted to maximize the signal intensity provided that the secondary phase shifts are known. Third, it is demonstrated that theory enables one to accurately measure secondary phase shifts and amplitude imbalances. Application to constant time 2D [ 13C, 1H]-HSQC spectra recorded for a protein sample with canonical MHS/HS schemes showed that accurate CAM data acquisition can be readily implemented on modern spectrometers for experiments based on through-bond polarization transfer. Fourth, when moderate variations of secondary phase shifts with primary phase shift and/or sampling directionality are encountered, generalized theory allowed comparison of the robustness of different MHS/HS schemes for CAM data acquisition, and thus to identify the scheme best suited to suppress dispersive peak components and quadrature image peaks. Moreover, it is shown that for spectra acquired with several indirect evolution periods, the best suited scheme can be identified independently for each of the periods. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Quaternion multiplication implements 3D rotation, but is expensive (usually 16 floating-point multiplications and 12 additions). This paper proposes an alternative quaternion representation using logarithms to reduce multiplication cost. The real Logarithmic Number System (LNS) allows fast and inexpensive multiplication and division in embedded and FPGA-based systems. Recent advances in the Complex LNS (CLNS) [5] have made fast log-polar complex representation affordable. Although the quaternion logarithm function is also well-defined, it is not useful to simplify multiplication (in the same way real and complex logarithms are) because quaternion multiplication is not commutative but quaternion addition is. To overcome this, we propose a novel Quaternion Complex (QCLNS) representation using a pair of CLNS numbers. This representation implements quaternion multiplication using only the theoretical minimum [11], [15] of 8 LNS multipliers (i.e., fixed-point adders) and two CLNS adders. Because CLNS numbers are more compact than ordinary rectangular complex representation, single-precision QCLNS occupies 10.9 percent less memory than conventional quaternion representation. Extrapolating conventional LNS and floating-point synthesis data from Fu et al. [12], QCLNS saves on average 10 percent of FPGA resources for precisions between 13 and 45 bits. © 2011 IEEE.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031155","afid":"60031155","affilname":"University of Patras","affiliation-city":"Rio","affiliation-country":"Greece"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008827","afid":"60008827","affilname":"University of Wyoming","affiliation-city":"Laramie","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000060","afid":"60000060","affilname":"Lehigh University","affiliation-city":"Bethlehem","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402910976","authid":"7402910976","authname":"Arnold M.","surname":"Arnold","given-name":"Mark G.","initials":"M.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000060"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56253058500","authid":"56253058500","authname":"Cowles J.","surname":"Cowles","given-name":"John","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008827"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003543522","authid":"7003543522","authname":"Paliouras V.","surname":"Paliouras","given-name":"Vassilis","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031155"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6505877354","authid":"6505877354","authname":"Kouretas I.","surname":"Kouretas","given-name":"Ioannis","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031155"}]}],"authkeywords":"Complex number | FPGA | hardware function evaluation | Logarithmic Number System | quaternion | rotation","article-number":"5992106","source-id":"74910","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84860398215"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84860398215?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84860398215&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84860398215&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S092427161100075X"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84860398215","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84860398215","eid":"2-s2.0-84860398215","dc:title":"A bundle adjustment approach with inner constraints for the scaled orthographic projection","dc:creator":"Blonquist K.","prism:publicationName":"ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","prism:issn":"09242716","prism:volume":"66","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"919-926","prism:coverDate":"2011-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2011","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2011.07.001","pii":"S092427161100075X","dc:description":"Bundle adjustment is a method for simultaneously calculating both the interior and exterior orientation parameters of a set of images, and the object-space coordinates of the observed points. In the case of long focal length lenses and narrow field-of-view (FOV) imaging situations, collinearity based (perspective projection) algorithms may result in linear dependencies between parameters that cause solution instability. The use of a scaled orthographic projection model based on linear algebraic formulations was therefore adopted to reduce this risk. Using quaternions, a new mathematical model is derived that includes the partial derivatives as well as the inner constraint equations for a scaled orthographic bundle adjustment. The model was then tested using two image sets of a single, small vessel (about 6. m length) with a cube target of known dimensions at two distinct ranges; perspective solutions were also calculated for comparison. RMS residual errors of 0.74-0.78 pixels associated with the new method compare favorably to a residual error range of 0.59-0.74 pixels using a perspective bundle adjustment of the same target points. Relative precisions (as a ratio of target size) of between 1:1650 and 1:750 have been achieved at ranges of 375. m and 850. m, respectively, given comparisons with the known cube dimensions. A third image dataset consisting of a network of 16 images was solved with a 1:2200 relative precision showing the new method can successfully handle high redundancy. For the experiments that were conducted, the new method was found to produce less precise results than the perspective bundle solution for a FOV of 0.50-0.65° where the object fills 5-8% of the image. However, it was found to match the precision of the perspective model (with an uncalibrated camera) for a FOV of 0.20-0.30° where the object of interest fills only 1-2% of the full image. © 2011 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The new type of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with rudders and vectored thrusters which are combined to control the course is studied. Firstly, Euler angles representation and quaternion method are applied to establish six-DOF kinematic model respectively, then Newton second law and Lagrangian approach are used to deduce the vectored thruster AUV's nonlinear dynamic equations with six degrees of freedom (DOF) respectively in complex sea conditions based on the random wave theory according to the structural and kinetic characteristics of the vectored thruster AUV in this paper. The kinematic models and dynamic models based on different theories have the same expression and conclusion, which shows that the kinematic models and dynamic models of the vectored thruster AUV are accurate. The Runge-Kutta arithmetic is used to solve the dynamic equations, which not only can simulate the motions such as cruise and hover but also can describe the vehicle's low-frequency and high-frequency motion. The results of computation show that the mobility of the vectored thruster AUV in interference-free environment and the integrated signals including low-frequency motion signal and high-frequency motion signal in environmental disturbance accord with practical situation, which not only solve the problem of especial singularities when the pitch angle θ= ±90° but also clears up the difficulties of computation and display of the coupled nonlinear motion equations in complex sea conditions. Moreover, the high maneuverability of the vectored thruster AUV equipped with rudders and vectored thrusters is validated, which lays a foundation for the control system design. © 2011 Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024350","afid":"60024350","affilname":"National University of Defense Technology China","affiliation-city":"Changsha","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26867608600","authid":"26867608600","authname":"Gao F.","surname":"Gao","given-name":"Fudong","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403223313","authid":"7403223313","authname":"Pan C.","surname":"Pan","given-name":"Cunyun","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56434759500","authid":"56434759500","authname":"Xu X.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Xiaojun","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024350"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57774740800","authid":"57774740800","authname":"Zhang X.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xiang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024350"}]}],"authkeywords":"Autonomous underwater vehicle | Complex sea conditions | Nonlinear dynamic characteristics | Vectored thruster","source-id":"19806","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/82555181701"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/82555181701?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=82555181701&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=82555181701&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/82555181701","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:82555181701","eid":"2-s2.0-82555181701","dc:title":"A secure color images watermarking algorithm based on holistic quaternion operation","dc:creator":"Sun J.","prism:publicationName":"Advances in Information Sciences and Service Sciences","prism:issn":"19763700","prism:volume":"3","prism:issueIdentifier":"10","prism:pageRange":"363-374","prism:coverDate":"2011-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2011","prism:doi":"10.4156/AISS.vol3.issue10.45","dc:description":"2D Fourier transform and singular value decomposition are fundamental tools in image processing. Recently proposed quaternion Fourier transform (QFT), by using two standard complex fast Fourier transforms, has given special support to color image processing in a holistic manner. In this paper we present, for the first time, a security holistic color image watermarking scheme by using the combination of quaternion Fourier transform and quaternion singular value decomposition(QSVD). The host image is divided into blocks followed by taking the QFT and QSVD of each block. The specially designed watermarks, closely to the decomposed unitary matrices U and V, are embedded in the singular values of each block. The real singular values contain both luminance and chrominance information of the color image that ensure the watermarks to spread into all color components in the spatial domain. Relevance between the watermarks and the host image is improved and the false positive rate is sharply decreased as well as the counterfeiting is hard to carry out. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed watermarking scheme performs better than assembled independent multi-channel watermarking scheme in imperceptibility as well as the SVD based and the existing quaternion based watermarking schemes in security.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60064143","afid":"60064143","affilname":"Nanjing University of Information Science &amp; Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55547135830","authid":"55547135830","authname":"Sun J.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Jing","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12773171100","authid":"12773171100","authname":"Jing-yu Y.","surname":"Jing-yu","given-name":"Yang","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60064143"}]}],"authkeywords":"Digital Watermarking | False detection rate | Quaternion | Singular value decomposition","source-id":"19700200842","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/81355164112"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/81355164112?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=81355164112&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=81355164112&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/81355164112","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:81355164112","eid":"2-s2.0-81355164112","dc:title":"Stereovision based ego-motion estimation algorithm for lunar rover","dc:creator":"Cao F.","prism:publicationName":"Jilin Daxue Xuebao (Gongxueban)/Journal of Jilin University (Engineering and Technology Edition)","prism:issn":"16715497","prism:volume":"41","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"1592-1597","prism:coverDate":"2011-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2011","dc:description":"A new 6-DoF state ego-motion estimation algorithm was presented based on the lunar rover stereovision image sequence to realize the autonomous navigation of the rover.

The purpose of this paper is to describe a visual odometry strategy using only one camera in country roads. Design/methodology/approach - This monocular odometery system uses as input only those images provided by a single camera mounted on the roof of the vehicle and the framework is composed of three main parts: image motion estimation, ego-motion computation and visual odometry. The image motion is estimated based on a hyper-complex wavelet phase-derived optical flow field. The ego-motion of the vehicle is computed by a blocked RANdom SAmple Consensus algorithm and a maximum likelihood estimator based on a 4-degrees of freedom motion model. These as instantaneous ego-motion measurements are used to update the vehicle trajectory according to a dead-reckoning model and unscented Kalman filter. Findings - The authors' proposed framework and algorithms are validated on videos from a real automotive platform. Furthermore, the recovered trajectory is superimposed onto a digital map, and the localization results from this method are compared to the ground truth measured with a GPS/INS joint system. These experimental results indicate that the framework and the algorithms are effective. Originality/value - The effective framework and algorithms for visual odometry using only one camera in country roads are introduced in this paper.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010080","afid":"60010080","affilname":"Nanjing University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35367319800","authid":"35367319800","authname":"Wang C.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Cailing","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010080"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403563683","authid":"7403563683","authname":"Zhao C.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Chunxia","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010080"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12773171100","authid":"12773171100","authname":"Yang J.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Jingyu","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010080"}]}],"authkeywords":"4-DOF ego-motion model | Blocked RANSAC | Ego-motion estimation | Monocular odometry | Motion | Phase-derived optical flow | Road vehicles | Robotics","source-id":"18047","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80054739281"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80054739281?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80054739281&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80054739281&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80054739281","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:80054739281","eid":"2-s2.0-80054739281","dc:title":"A class of fast quaternion valued variable stepsize stochastic gradient learning algorithms for vector sensor processes","dc:creator":"Wang M.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781457710865"}],"prism:pageRange":"2783-2786","prism:coverDate":"2011-10-24","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2011","prism:doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2011.6033585","dc:description":"We introduce a class of gradient adaptive stepsize algorithms for quaternion valued adaptive filtering based on three- and four-dimensional vector sensors. This equips the recently introduced quaternion least mean square (QLMS) algorithm with enhanced tracking ability and enables it to be more responsive to dynamically changing environments, while maintaining its desired characteristics of catering for large dynamical differences and coupling between signal components. For generality, the analysis is performed for the widely linear signal model, which by virtue of accounting for signal noncircularity, is optimal in the mean squared error (MSE) sense for both second order circular (proper) and noncircular (improper) processes. The widely linear QLMS (WL-QLMS) employing the proposed adaptive stepsize modifications is shown to provide enhanced performance for both synthetic and real world quaternion valued signals. Simulations include signals with drastically different component dynamics, such as four dimensional quaternion comprising three dimensional turbulent wind and air temperature for renewable energy applications. © 2011 IEEE.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015150","afid":"60015150","affilname":"Imperial College London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56139299400","authid":"56139299400","authname":"Wang M.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Mingxuan","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57829404900","authid":"57829404900","authname":"Took C.C.","surname":"Took","given-name":"Clive Cheong","initials":"C.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006513328","authid":"7006513328","authname":"Mandic D.P.","surname":"Mandic","given-name":"Danilo P.","initials":"D.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]}],"article-number":"6033585","source-id":"96537","fund-acr":"EPSRC","fund-no":"EP/H026266/1","fund-sponsor":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80054007715"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80054007715?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80054007715&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80054007715&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80054007715","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:80054007715","eid":"2-s2.0-80054007715","dc:title":"Georeferencing of satellite linear array stereo images with quaternion attitude kinematics equation","dc:creator":"Gong H.","prism:publicationName":"2011 International Symposium on Image and Data Fusion, ISIDF 2011","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781457709692"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2011-10-17","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2011","prism:doi":"10.1109/ISIDF.2011.6024260","dc:description":"A quaternion method for georeferencing of satellite linear array stereo images is proposed in this paper.

Then the georeferencing results can be obtained after solving the collinearity equations with ground control points (GCPs). We validate this method through experiment with SPOT images. Experimental results indicate that quaternion attitude kinematics equation can be used for georeferencing of satellite linear array stereo images, the accuracy is as much as or even better than that of the conventional method, and the quaternion EOPs can overcome much of correlation. This method can successfully used in satellite linear array stereo images, and it can also effectively avoid a great deal of computation of trigonometric functions and the potential unstable factors.

Based on a theoretic 2D generalization of the analytic signal leading to a strong 2D signal modeling, this representation uses actual 2D analytic wavelets and yields subbands having a shift-invariant magnitude and a 3-angle phase, using the quaternion algebra. Our experiment furthers the understanding of this quite sophisticated tool, and shows its practical interest by a clear improvement of a famous wavelet application: texture classification. Thanks to coherent multiscale analysis brought by the QWT we obtain better classification results than with standard wavelets in a similar process. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The nonlinear attitude dynamic and kinematic equations are considered for the case that the relative quaternion and angular velocity are employed such that the dynamics of formation agents are strongly coupled. More specifically, the controller structure includes a lead filter which is derived without explicit differentiation of attitude to synthesize angular velocity-like signals. And the stability of such a formation is also investigated by the development of a novel Lyapunov function candidate containing cross/mixed terms. Considering the affect of external disturbance, a modified controller is developed to confer the closed-loop system the capability of L2-gain disturbance attenuation. A sufficient condition is provided under which this controller could render the system uniformly ultimately bounded stable. As such, the closed-loop system is robust with respect to any disturbance within a quantifiable restriction on the amplitude. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed controllers to maintain the relative attitude cooperation by correcting for initial offsets and external perturbation effects that tend to disperse the formation. © 2011 Chinese Assoc of Automati.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56756403500","authid":"56756403500","authname":"Lv Y.","surname":"Lv","given-name":"Yueyong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8931326900","authid":"8931326900","authname":"Hu Q.","surname":"Hu","given-name":"Qinglei","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13403245700","authid":"13403245700","authname":"Ma G.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Guangfu","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude regulation | Cooperative attitude control | Decentralized output feedback | L -gain 2 | Spacecraft formation flying","article-number":"6000936","source-id":"19900194816","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80052848956"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80052848956?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80052848956&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80052848956&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80052848956","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:80052848956","eid":"2-s2.0-80052848956","dc:title":"Application of quaternion scale space approach for motion processing","dc:creator":"Jabłoński B.","prism:publicationName":"Advances in Intelligent and Soft Computing","prism:issn":"18675662","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783642231537"}],"prism:volume":"102","prism:pageRange":"141-148","prism:coverDate":"2011-09-21","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2011","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-23154-4_16","dc:description":"Scale space approach turned out to be a powerful framework for image processing purposes.
