The contribution of this work is to generalize the real and complex wavelet transforms and to derive for the first time a quaternionic wavelet pyramid for multi-resolution analysis using the quaternion phase concept. The three quaternion phase components of the detail wavelet filters together with a confidence mask are used for the computation of a denser image velocity field which is updated through various levels of a multi-resolution pyramid. Our local model computes the motion by the linear evaluation of the disparity equations involving the three phases of the quaternion detail high-pass filters. A confidence measure singles out those regions where horizontal and vertical displacement can reliably be estimated simultaneously.

It is designed to yield the geolocation determination accuracy of 6m from attitude and position estimates and that of 3m with an additional high-bandwidth measurement. Presented in this paper are ALOS's platform and ground systems technologies developed for achieving the attitude determination accuracy and the position determination accuracy. They include a precision star tracker, optimal attitude estimation algorithms (real-time and off-line), an alignment change reduction, a jitter sensor, a precision GPS receiver, and a ground-based position estimation algorithm. The star tracker provides the best star position accuracy (random error: 9.0arcsec, and bias error: 0.74arcsec). The on-board attitude determination algorithm estimates attitude quaternion by applying an extended Kalman filter. The off-line attitude estimation introduced an extended-Kalman-filter-based smoother. To minimize the alignment change, the sensors are placed on the optical bench subject to precise temperature control. The jitter sensor provides precise angular information (0.010arcsec) from 2Hz to 500Hz and extends the attitude determination bandwidth. The dual-frequency GPS receiver capable of measuring pseudoranges and carrier phases allows the ground-based position determination with sub-meter accuracy.","citedby-count":"47","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022990","afid":"60022990","affilname":"Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency","affiliation-city":"Chofu","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57080340000","authid":"57080340000","authname":"Iwata T.","surname":"Iwata","given-name":"Takanori","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022990"}]}],"authkeywords":"ALOS | Attitude Determination | GPS Receiver | Orbit Determination | Star Tracker","article-number":"04","source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/24644481896"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/24644481896?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=24644481896&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=24644481896&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/24644481896","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:24644481896","eid":"2-s2.0-24644481896","dc:title":"Annual and semiannual variations of the Earth's gravitational field from satellite laser ranging and CHAMP","dc:creator":"Moore P.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","prism:issn":"21699313","prism:eIssn":"21699356","prism:volume":"110","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"1-14","prism:coverDate":"2005-06-04","prism:coverDisplayDate":"4 June 2005","prism:doi":"10.1029/2004JB003448","dc:description":"Temporal variability in the Earth's gravity field has been estimated from 4 years of satellite laser ranging (SLR) to five geodetic satellites, Lageos 1 and 2, Stella, Starlette, and Ajisai supplemented by over 2 years of CHAMP precise orbital positioning, attitude quaternions, and accelerometry. The study considers variability at the annual and semiannual periodicities in the full field of degrees 2-6. A singular value decomposition has been employed in an attempt to recover variability from stand-alone CHAMP data. Temporal gravity field variability from SLR and from SLR and CHAMP has been computed and compared against geophysical models for surface mass redistribution. For a 4 × 4 field best agreement of the annual variation results in an RMS geoid difference of 0.76 mm with correlation coefficients above 0.85. On extending to a 6 × 6 field agreement decreases to about 1.5 mm RMS in geoid height with correlations of 0.6 at the annual cycle. For the extended field the ocean mass redistribution from Ocean Circulation and Climate Advanced Modeling project and TOPEX is seen to be deficient with near comparable correlations being obtained by neglecting the ocean contribution. The semiannual signal is weaker and less well determined. For the 4 × 4 field, correlations are no better than 0.6 with RMS of 1 mm between the SLR and geophysical models. Results show that CHAMP has a positive effect on the annual variation for a 4 × 4 field but marginal for the extended 6 × 6 field. CHAMP has a negative impact at the semiannual frequency.

However, neither the detailed function of the nonlinearities nor the higher-order image statistics are yet fully understood. We suggest that these complicated issues can not be tackled by one single approach, but require a range of methods, and the understanding of the crosslinks between the results. We consider three basic approaches: (i) State space descriptions can theoretically provide complete information about statistical properties and nonlinear operations, but their practical usage is confined to very low-dimensional settings. We discuss the use of representation-related state-space coordinates (multivariate wavelet statistics) and of basic non-linear coordinate transformations of the state space (e.g., a polar transform). (ii) Indirect methods, like unsupervised learning in multi-layer networks, provide complete optimization results, but no direct information on the statistical properties, and no simple model structures. (iii) Approximation by lower-order terms of power-series expansions is a classical strategy that has not yet received broad attention. On the statistical side, this approximation amounts to cumulant functions and higher-order spectra (polyspectra), on the processing side to Volterra-Wiener systems. In this context we suggest that an important concept for the understanding of natural scene statistics, of nonlinear neurons, and of biological pattern recognition can be found in AND-like combinations of frequency components. We investigate how the different approaches can be related to each other, how they can contribute to the understanding of cortical nonlinearities such as complex cells, cortical gain control, end-stopping and other extraclassical receptive field properties, and how we can obtain a nonlinear perspective on overcomplete representations and invariant coding in visual cortex. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.","citedby-count":"26","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028717","afid":"60028717","affilname":"Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München","affiliation-city":"Munich","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008293","afid":"60008293","affilname":"Universität Bremen","affiliation-city":"Bremen","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"pubmed-id":"16411496","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56021568900","authid":"56021568900","authname":"Zetzsche C.","surname":"Zetzsche","given-name":"Christoph","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008293"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008293"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6506879424","authid":"6506879424","authname":"Nuding U.","surname":"Nuding","given-name":"Ulrich","initials":"U.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008293"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028717"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028717"}]}],"authkeywords":"Bispectrum | End-stopping | Extra-classical receptive field | Higher-order statistics | Hypercomplex cells | Natural scene statistics | Nonlinear mechanisms | Polyspectra | Surround suppression","source-id":"27318","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/22144458373"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/22144458373?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=22144458373&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=22144458373&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/22144458373","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:22144458373","eid":"2-s2.0-22144458373","dc:title":"Research on three dimensional-modeling and scene simulation","dc:creator":"Lu T.","prism:publicationName":"Zhongnan Daxue Xuebao (Ziran Kexue Ban)/Journal of Central South University (Science and Technology)","prism:issn":"16727207","prism:volume":"36","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"501-505","prism:coverDate":"2005-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2005","dc:description":"The key technologies of realizing bridge 3D-modeling and scene simulation were studied on computer, and the simulating application system was developed at VC++ platform combining OpenGL graphic library based on objected-orient theory.

The purpose of this work is to describe a method for interpolating three-dimensional kinematic data, minimizing error while maintaining ease of calculation. This method uses cubic quaternion and hermite interpolation to fill gaps between kinematic data points. Data sets with a small number of samples were extracted from a larger data set and used to validate the technique. Two additional types of interpolation were applied and then compared to the cubic quaternion interpolation. Displacement errors below 2% using the cubic quaternion method were achieved using 4% of the total samples, representing a decrease in error over the other algorithms.

The system of pose and motion estimation which is based on the monocular vision was defined as a nonlinear stochastic model. The system used the iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF), the first-order Stirling's interpolation filter (DD1) and the second-order Stirling's interpolation filter (DD2) respectively as nonlinear state estimators to estimate pose and motion.

The nature of this salient features and of the underlying strategy for their selection can be investigated within the context of natural scene statistics. For this, saccadic eye movements of human observers are recorded for a variety of natural and artificial test images, and the statistical properties of the fixated image regions are analyzed. The second-order statistics indicate that regions with higher spatial variance have a significantly higher probability to be fixated. Therefore, local contrast is a salient feature. It was difficult to find additional differences in the local power spectra that can yield unequivocal information about a preference for specific local form properties. Differences that can be more easily interpreted as structural properties are derived from an investigation with higher-order statistics (bi-spectral density). The results indicate that non-redundant, intrinsically two-dimensional image features, such as, curved lines and edges, occlusions, isolated spots, and so on, play an important role in the saccadic selection process. Such features cannot be extracted by the classic spatial frequency selective filter mechanisms but require nonlinear AND-like interactions among frequency components as possibly provided by end-stopping or hyper-complex properties related to the extra-classical receptive field.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008293","afid":"60008293","affilname":"Universität Bremen","affiliation-city":"Bremen","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book","subtype":"ch","subtypeDescription":"Book Chapter","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56021568900","authid":"56021568900","authname":"Zetzsche C.","surname":"Zetzsche","given-name":"Christoph","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008293"}]}],"source-id":"21101132280","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/35348887140"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/35348887140?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=35348887140&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=35348887140&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/35348887140","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:35348887140","eid":"2-s2.0-35348887140","dc:title":"Geometry of the ODF-to-PDF projection in quaternion reprensentation","dc:creator":"Schaeben H.","prism:publicationName":"Materials Science Forum","prism:issn":"02555476","prism:eIssn":"16629752","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"087849975X"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780878499755"}],"prism:volume":"495-497","prism:issueIdentifier":"PART 1","prism:pageRange":"283-288","prism:coverDate":"2005-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2005","prism:doi":"10.4028/0-87849-975-x.283","dc:description":"This communication compiles propositions concerning the spherical geometry of rotations when represented by unit quaternions.

The approach uses information from an optical sensor, which employs relatively simple electronic circuits with modest digital signal processing requirements, to provide multiple line-of-sight vectors from spacecraft to another. The sensor mechanism is well suited for both near-Earth and deep space applications since it is fully independent of any external systems. The line-of-sight measurements are coupled with gyro measurements and dynamical models in an extended Kalman filter to determine relative attitude, position and gyro biases. The quaternion is used to describe the relative kinematics and general relative orbital equations are used to describe the positional dynamics. Simulation results indicate that the combined sensor/estimator approach provides accurate relative position and attitude estimates.","citedby-count":"43","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032083","afid":"60032083","affilname":"University at Buffalo, The State University of New York","affiliation-city":"Buffalo","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020547","afid":"60020547","affilname":"Texas A&amp;M University","affiliation-city":"College Station","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010401","afid":"60010401","affilname":"American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.","affiliation-city":"Reston","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/10639194000","authid":"10639194000","authname":"Kim S.G.","surname":"Kim","given-name":"Son Goo","initials":"S.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032083"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010401"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004410458","authid":"7004410458","authname":"Crassidis J.L.","surname":"Crassidis","given-name":"John L.","initials":"J.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032083"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010401"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36349728000","authid":"36349728000","authname":"Cheng Y.","surname":"Cheng","given-name":"Yang","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032083"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010401"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15750363400","authid":"15750363400","authname":"Fosbury A.M.","surname":"Fosbury","given-name":"Adam M.","initials":"A.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032083"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010401"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35546731900","authid":"35546731900","authname":"Junkins J.L.","surname":"Junkins","given-name":"John L.","initials":"J.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020547"}]}],"source-id":"145451","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/23744468297"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/23744468297?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=23744468297&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=23744468297&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/23744468297","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:23744468297","eid":"2-s2.0-23744468297","dc:title":"William Rowan Hamilton: Mathematical genius","dc:creator":"Wilkins D.","prism:publicationName":"Physics World","prism:issn":"09538585","prism:volume":"18","prism:issueIdentifier":"8","prism:pageRange":"33-36","prism:coverDate":"2005-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"August 2005","prism:doi":"10.1088/2058-7058/18/8/34","dc:description":"The role played by mathematical genius, William Rowan Hamilton, best remembered for quaternions and his pioneering work on optics and dynamics is discussed.

Positioning requires double time integration of the gravity-compensated accelerometer signals during swing. An interpolation technique applied to attitude quaternions was developed to improve the accuracy of orientation and positioning estimates by accounting for the effect of sensor bias and scale factor drifts. A simulation environment was developed for the analysis and testing of the proposed algorithm on a synthetic movement trajectory. The aim was to define the true attitude and positioning used in the computation of estimation errors. By thermal modelling, the changes of bias and scale factor of the inertial sensors, calibrated at a single reference temperature, were analysed over a range of ± 10°C, for measurement noise standard deviations up to σg = 2.5° s-1 (gyroscope) and σa = 0.05 m s-2 (accelerometer). The compensation technique reduced the maximum root mean square errors (RMSEs) to: RMSEθ = 14.6° (orientation) and RMSEd = 17.7 cm (positioning) for an integration interval of one gait cycle (an improvement of 3° and 7 cm); RMSEθ = 14.8° and RMSEd = 30.0 cm for an integration interval of two gait cycles (an improvement of 11° and 262 cm). © IFMBE: 2005.","citedby-count":"90","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028039","afid":"60028039","affilname":"Sant'Anna Scuola Universitaria Superiore Pisa","affiliation-city":"Pisa","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"pubmed-id":"15742725","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005616188","authid":"7005616188","authname":"Sabatini A.","surname":"Sabatini","given-name":"Angelo M.","initials":"A.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028039"}]}],"authkeywords":"Computer simulations | Gait analysis | Inertial sensing | Quaternion of rotation | Strap-down integration","source-id":"17979","fund-acr":"MIUR","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/13444259724"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/13444259724?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=13444259724&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=13444259724&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0960077904006101"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/13444259724","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:13444259724","eid":"2-s2.0-13444259724","dc:title":"Symbolic dynamics in investigation of quaternionic Julia sets","dc:creator":"Lakner M.","prism:publicationName":"Chaos, Solitons and Fractals","prism:issn":"09600779","prism:volume":"24","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"1189-1201","prism:coverDate":"2005-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2005","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.chaos.2004.09.067","pii":"S0960077904006101","dc:description":"We focus our attention on the dynamics of the simplest quaternionic quadratic function fQ(X) = X2 + Q.

Although it has been shown that orthogonal codes in full-rate exist only for 2 Tx-antennas in complex constellations, a series of complex quasi-orthogonal codes for 4 Tx-antennas is still proposed to have good performance recently. This quasi-orthogonal scheme enables the codes to reach the optimal nonorthogonality, which can be measured by taking the expectation over all transmit signals of the ratios between the powers of the off-diagonal and diagonal components. This correspondence extends the quaternionic identification to the above encoding methods. Based upon tensor product for giving the quaternionic space a linear extension, a complete necessary and sufficient condition for identifying any given complex quasi-orthogonal code with the extended space is generalized by considering every possible two-dimensional ℝ-algebra. © 2005 IEEE.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022637","afid":"60022637","affilname":"National Taiwan Normal University","affiliation-city":"Taipei","affiliation-country":"Taiwan"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005429","afid":"60005429","affilname":"National Taiwan University","affiliation-city":"Taipei","affiliation-country":"Taiwan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55733169700","authid":"55733169700","authname":"Chen M.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Ming Yang","initials":"M.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005429"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36076653800","authid":"36076653800","authname":"Li H.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Hua Chieh","initials":"H.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022637"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202463605","authid":"7202463605","authname":"Pei S.","surname":"Pei","given-name":"Soo Chang","initials":"S.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005429"}]}],"authkeywords":"Algebraic codes | Division algebras | Quasi-orthogonal space-time block code (STBC) | Quaternions | R-algebras | Representations of finite groups | Tensor product","source-id":"15107","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
