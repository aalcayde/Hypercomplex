The rotation matrix estimation involved in this problem is typical instances of the single rotation averaging and conjugate rotation averaging problem. In order to avoid the ambiguity caused by the angle-axis and quaternion representations and obtain the global solution, a convex relation method is proposed for chordal metric under L-2 norm. In addition, a weighted robust cost function for the rotation averaging problems is also proposed to deal with the additional information about the measurements of the rotation and all the data including the outliers. The experimental results show that this method works efficiently and reliably. Meanwhile, the optimality is certified most of the time within a few sequence of linear matrix inequalities.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025761","afid":"60025761","affilname":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56304782900","authid":"56304782900","orcid":"0000-0002-4761-5120","authname":"Ke F.","surname":"Ke","given-name":"Fengkai","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402994866","authid":"7402994866","authname":"Xie J.","surname":"Xie","given-name":"Jingming","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58161673300","authid":"58161673300","authname":"Chen Y.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Youping","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16445013000","authid":"16445013000","authname":"Zhang D.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Dailin","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]}],"authkeywords":"Camera calibration | Chordal metric | Convex relaxation | Rotation averaging","source-id":"110152","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"51174151","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84951839291"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84951839291?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84951839291&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84951839291&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84951839291","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84951839291","eid":"2-s2.0-84951839291","dc:title":"A miniature, low-power star tracker for precision pointing nanosatellites","dc:creator":"Rowen D.","prism:publicationName":"Advances in the Astronautical Sciences","prism:issn":"00653438","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780877036210"}],"prism:volume":"154","prism:pageRange":"145-156","prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2015","dc:description":"The design of a compact, low-power star-tracker system is presented for attitude determination in nanosatellites where size, weight, and power are at an extreme premium. The system contains up to five CMOS camera modules linked to a shared image-processing board. Frame capture is handled by a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), which applies a series of filters to mitigate image-sensor artifacts and automatically adjust luminance thresholds. Filtered pixel data is transferred to a low-power PIC microprocessor, which matches the image against a catalog of stars to solve for attitude. This division of processing minimizes the required memory footprint and maximizes the idle time of power-intensive circuits for improved energy efficiency. PIC memory usage is kept within limits by using only a subset of the star catalog based on partitioning of the full catalog into regions that are loaded into memory as needed. The attitude determination algorithm finds the solution that maximizes the number of pixel cluster locations matched to star catalog locations, with the secondary objective of minimizing line of sight residuals; this approach is tolerant to the presence of hot pixels and non-star objects in the image. An attitude quaternion (as well as the measurement geometry matrix) is provided for use in a recursive attitude determination filter (e.g., to blend with gyro data). Test results are presented showing sensitivity as a function of exposure time.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029575","afid":"60029575","affilname":"Aerospace Corporation, USA","affiliation-city":"El Segundo","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14036221800","authid":"14036221800","authname":"Rowen D.","surname":"Rowen","given-name":"Darren W.","initials":"D.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029575"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16176414800","authid":"16176414800","authname":"Utter A.","surname":"Utter","given-name":"Alexander C.","initials":"A.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029575"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603194970","authid":"6603194970","authname":"Dolphus R.","surname":"Dolphus","given-name":"Richard M.","initials":"R.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029575"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57021653200","authid":"57021653200","authname":"Alcid E.","surname":"Alcid","given-name":"Eddson M.","initials":"E.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029575"}]}],"source-id":"12376","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84951154734"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84951154734?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84951154734&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84951154734&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84951154734","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84951154734","eid":"2-s2.0-84951154734","dc:title":"Novel PbS detector chip pattern with extinction function","dc:creator":"Chen F.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","prism:issn":"0277786X","prism:eIssn":"1996756X","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781628419016"}],"prism:volume":"9676","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2015","prism:doi":"10.1117/12.2199520","dc:description":"A novel chip pattern with extinction function in Lead salt detectors is specified.

This paper demonstrates these properties using an explicit representation of the automorphisms on split-octonions, the noncompact form of the exceptional Lie group G2. This group generates specific rotations of (3 + 4)-vector parts of split octonions with three extra time-like coordinates and in infinitesimal limit imitates standard Poincare transformations. In this picture translations are represented by noncompact Lorentz-type rotations towards the extra time-like coordinates. It is shown how the G2 algebra's chirality yields an intrinsic left-right asymmetry of a certain 3-vector (spin), as well as a parity violating effect on light emitted by a moving quantum system. Elementary particles are connected with the special elements of the algebra which nullify octonionic intervals. Then the zero-norm conditions lead to free particle Lagrangians, which allow virtual trajectories also and exhibit the appearance of spatial horizons governing by mass parameters.","citedby-count":"15","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071909","afid":"60071909","affilname":"Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University","affiliation-city":"Tbilisi","affiliation-country":"Georgia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071900","afid":"60071900","affilname":"Georgian Academy of Sciences E.

Testing results indicate that the positioning accuracy can reach 30‰ and 20‰ in the complex magnetic-field and non-magnetic interference environments respectively.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020620","afid":"60020620","affilname":"Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55506175400","authid":"55506175400","authname":"Tian Z.","surname":"Tian","given-name":"Zengshan","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56973372600","authid":"56973372600","authname":"Qian G.","surname":"Qian","given-name":"Guang","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55506126300","authid":"55506126300","authname":"Zhou M.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Mu","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]}],"authkeywords":"Extended Kalman filter | Gait detection | Indoor positioning | Pedestrian dead reckoning | Quaternion","source-id":"19700186822","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84946548683"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84946548683?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84946548683&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84946548683&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84946548683","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84946548683","eid":"2-s2.0-84946548683","dc:title":"Structural state detection using quaternion-based three-channel joint transmissibility","dc:creator":"Ren T.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Vibroengineering","prism:issn":"13928716","prism:volume":"17","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"928-938","prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2015","dc:description":"This paper presented the use of quaternion-based three-channel joint transmissibility (QTJT) in structural state detection. During the detection process, the time-domain pure quaternion sequences were obtained based on the three dimensional spatial vibration signals from two different testing points. Then QTJTs of the object structure under different states were calculated by discrete quaternion Fourier transform (DQFT). Subsequently, modular vectors of the QTJTs were utilized to construct the state matrix of the object structure and the Karhunen-Loeve Transform (K-LT) was employed to calculate the state feature index vectors. Finally, Euclidean distance between state feature index vectors was obtained, which was considered as the state indicator. An actual experiment was performed on the test platform of ballastless track and the result with 100 percent correct identification was achieved. Combined with the experimental results, the advantages of QTJT comparing to transmissibility based on scalar signals were discussed. The QTJT can be used when the vibration composes from multiple dimensional synchronous vibrations. And more importantly, the QTJT is consistent with its theoretical value in spite of the installation orientation of the sensors.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004538","afid":"60004538","affilname":"Dalian University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8213070800","authid":"8213070800","authname":"Ren T.","surname":"Ren","given-name":"Tongqun","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56493617500","authid":"56493617500","authname":"He L.","surname":"He","given-name":"Liang","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55713257800","authid":"55713257800","authname":"Wang D.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Dazhi","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8544626500","authid":"8544626500","authname":"Liang J.","surname":"Liang","given-name":"Junsheng","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56494396700","authid":"56494396700","authname":"Hui M.","surname":"Hui","given-name":"Meiling","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004538"}]}],"authkeywords":"Karhunen-Loeve transform | Quaternion sequences | Quaternion-based three-channel joint transmissibility | State detection","source-id":"12200154705","fund-no":"51305064","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84946403566"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84946403566?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84946403566&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84946403566&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84946403566","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84946403566","eid":"2-s2.0-84946403566","dc:title":"Quaternion fisher discriminant analysis for bimodal multi-feature fusion","dc:creator":"Chen M.","prism:publicationName":"Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing","prism:issn":"21945357","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783319212050"}],"prism:volume":"370","prism:pageRange":"479-487","prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2015","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-21206-7_41","dc:description":"Aiming at the accuracy and security of pattern recognition system, this paper proposes a quaternion based multi-modal recognition algorithm that is more accurate and safe than unimodal, and fuses more features than most existing methods.

Gray images are used directly, or color images are converted to gray images before processing in previous image splicing detection algorithms. However, most natural images are color images. In order to make use of the color information in images, a classification algorithm is put forward which can use color images directly. In this paper, an algorithm based on Markov in Quaternion discrete cosine transform (QDCT) domain is proposed for image splicing detection.

Traditional methods process color images by either transforming them into gray scale or dividing them into red, green, and blue components for independent processing, which is definitely not effective in representing color information. Recently, a novel Polar Linear Canonical Transform (PLCT) with parameters in SL(2,5R) has been reported, which is a generalization of the well-known Polar Harmonic Transform (PHT). However, PLCT is defined on gray-scale images, so it cannot handle color images directly. To solve the problem, this paper generalizes PLCT from complex domain to hypercomplex domain using quaternion algebras, producing the Quaternion Polar Linear Canonical Transform (QPLCT). The performance of QPLCT is then evaluated with Quaternion Fractional Polar Exponential Transform (QPFrET) as an example. The experimental results show that the QPLCT performs better than the commonly used Quaternion form Zernike Moment (QZM) and pseudo-Zernike Moment (QPZM) in terms of image representation capability and numerical stability.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60083503","afid":"60083503","affilname":"Fujian University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Fuzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073460","afid":"60073460","affilname":"China University of Mining and Technology","affiliation-city":"Xuzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56883547100","authid":"56883547100","authname":"Hu B.","surname":"Hu","given-name":"Bo","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073460"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57054463000","authid":"57054463000","authname":"Zhou Y.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Yu","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073460"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55839736400","authid":"55839736400","authname":"Li L.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Lei Da","initials":"L.D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073460"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36652123800","authid":"36652123800","authname":"Zhang J.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Jian Ying","initials":"J.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073460"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57214682289","authid":"57214682289","authname":"Pan J.","surname":"Pan","given-name":"Jeng Shyang","initials":"J.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60083503"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]}],"authkeywords":"Orthogonal transforms | Quaternion fractional polar exponential transform | Quaternion polar linear canonical transform | Rotation invariance","source-id":"21100223313","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84942807978"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84942807978?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84942807978&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84942807978&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84942807978","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84942807978","eid":"2-s2.0-84942807978","dc:title":"Mechanical Fault Diagnosis Using Color Image Recognition of Vibration Spectrogram Based on Quaternion Invariable Moment","dc:creator":"Hua L.","prism:publicationName":"Mathematical Problems in Engineering","prism:issn":"1024123X","prism:eIssn":"15635147","prism:volume":"2015","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2015","prism:doi":"10.1155/2015/702760","dc:description":"Automatic extraction of time-frequency spectral image of mechanical faults can be achieved and faults can be identified consequently when rotating machinery spectral image processing technology is applied to fault diagnosis, which is an advantage. Acquired mechanical vibration signals can be converted into color time-frequency spectrum images by the processing of pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution. Then a feature extraction method based on quaternion invariant moment was proposed, combining image processing technology and multiweight neural network technology. The paper adopted quaternion invariant moment feature extraction method and gray level-gradient cooccurrence matrix feature extraction method and combined them with geometric learning algorithm and probabilistic neural network algorithm, respectively, and compared the recognition rates of rolling bearing faults. The experimental results show that the recognition rates of quaternion invariant moment are higher than gray level-gradient cooccurrence matrix in the same recognition method. The recognition rates of geometric learning algorithm are higher than probabilistic neural network algorithm in the same feature extraction method. So the method based on quaternion invariant moment geometric learning and multiweight neural network is superior. What is more, this algorithm has preferable generalization performance under the condition of fewer samples, and it has practical value and acceptation on the field of fault diagnosis for rotating machinery as well.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021783","afid":"60021783","affilname":"Nantong University","affiliation-city":"Nantong","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35195975900","authid":"35195975900","orcid":"0000-0002-7739-3733","authname":"Hua L.","surname":"Hua","given-name":"Liang","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021783"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36768806800","authid":"36768806800","orcid":"0000-0002-1005-6425","authname":"Qiang Y.","surname":"Qiang","given-name":"Yujian","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021783"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403129551","authid":"7403129551","authname":"Gu J.","surname":"Gu","given-name":"Juping","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021783"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192609061","authid":"57192609061","authname":"Chen L.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Ling","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021783"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9746253100","authid":"9746253100","authname":"Zhang X.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xinsong","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021783"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15754979200","authid":"15754979200","orcid":"0000-0001-6559-1129","authname":"Zhu H.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Hairong","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021783"}]}],"article-number":"702760","source-id":"13082","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84941236675"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84941236675?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84941236675&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84941236675&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84941236675","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84941236675","eid":"2-s2.0-84941236675","dc:title":"Uncovering the true nature of deformation microstructures using 3D analysis methods","dc:creator":"Ferry M.","prism:publicationName":"IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering","prism:issn":"17578981","prism:eIssn":"1757899X","prism:volume":"89","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"7 August 2015","prism:doi":"10.1088/1757-899X/89/1/012002","dc:description":"Three-dimensional electron backscatter diffraction (3D EBSD) has emerged as a powerful technique for generating 3D crystallographic information in reasonably large volumes of a microstructure. The technique uses a focused ion beam (FIB) as a high precision serial sectioning device for generating consecutive ion milled surfaces of a material, with each milled surface subsequently mapped by EBSD. The successive EBSD maps are combined using a suitable post-processing method to generate a crystallographic volume of the microstructure. The first part of this paper shows the usefulness of 3D EBSD for understanding the origin of various structural features associated with the plastic deformation of metals. The second part describes a new method for automatically identifying the various types of low and high angle boundaries found in deformed and annealed metals, particularly those associated with grains exhibiting subtle and gradual variations in orientation. We have adapted a 2D image segmentation technique, fast multiscale clustering, to 3D EBSD data using a novel variance function to accommodate quaternion data. This adaptation is capable of segmenting based on subtle and gradual variation as well as on sharp boundaries within the data. We demonstrate the excellent capabilities of this technique with application to 3D EBSD data sets generated from a range of cold rolled and annealed metals described in the paper.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028333","afid":"60028333","affilname":"UNSW Sydney","affiliation-city":"Sydney","affiliation-country":"Australia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000812","afid":"60000812","affilname":"Harvey Mudd College","affiliation-city":"Claremont","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "9", "$" :"9"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005135028","authid":"7005135028","authname":"Ferry M.","surname":"Ferry","given-name":"M.","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028333"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603710687","authid":"6603710687","authname":"Quadir M.","surname":"Quadir","given-name":"M.

Because of their height, buildings can easily be distinguished from the ground and small objects, allowing for their successful segmentation. Unfortunately, 3D knowledge is not always available, but there are ways to infer 3D information from 2D images. Shape-from-shading techniques extract height and surface normal information from a single 2D image by taking into consideration knowledge about illumination, reflectance and shape. In this paper, a novel feature is proposed that can describe the 3D information of reconstructed images based on a shape-from-shading technique in order to successfully acquire building boundaries. The results are promising and show that such a 3D feature can significantly assist in a correct building boundary detection and segmentation.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033359","afid":"60033359","affilname":"Kingston University","affiliation-city":"Kingston Upon Thames","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026208","afid":"60026208","affilname":"Centre for Research and Technology-Hellas","affiliation-city":"Thessaloniki","affiliation-country":"Greece"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015150","afid":"60015150","affilname":"Imperial College London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57208065320","authid":"57208065320","authname":"Konstantinidis D.","surname":"Konstantinidis","given-name":"Dimitrios","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13806485100","authid":"13806485100","authname":"Argyriou V.","surname":"Argyriou","given-name":"Vasileios","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033359"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003386658","authid":"7003386658","authname":"Stathaki T.","surname":"Stathaki","given-name":"Tania","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701851845","authid":"6701851845","authname":"Grammalidis N.","surname":"Grammalidis","given-name":"Nikos","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026208"}]}],"authkeywords":"3D reconstruction | Building segmentation | Kmeans | Quaternions | Satellite images | Shape-from-shading","source-id":"21100403815","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84939189390"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84939189390?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84939189390&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84939189390&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84939189390","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84939189390","eid":"2-s2.0-84939189390","dc:title":"Axis-exchanged compensation and gait parameters analysis for high accuracy indoor pedestrian dead reckoning","dc:creator":"Zhang H.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Sensors","prism:issn":"1687725X","prism:eIssn":"16877268","prism:volume":"2015","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2015","prism:doi":"10.1155/2015/915837","dc:description":"Pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) is an effective way for navigation coupled with GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) or weak GNSS signal environment like indoor scenario. However, indoor location with an accuracy of 1 to 2 meters determined by PDR based on MEMS-IMU is still very challenging. For one thing, heading estimation is an important problem in PDR because of the singularities. For another thing, walking distance estimation is also a critical problem for pedestrian walking with randomness. Based on the above two problems, this paper proposed axis-exchanged compensation and gait parameters analysis algorithm to improve the navigation accuracy. In detail, an axis-exchanged compensation factored quaternion algorithm is put forward first to overcome the singularities in heading estimation without increasing the amount of computation. Besides, real-time heading is updated by R-adaptive Kalman filter. Moreover, gait parameters analysis algorithm can be divided into two steps: cadence detection and step length estimation. Thus, a method of cadence classification and interval symmetry is proposed to detect the cadence accurately. Furthermore, a step length model adjusted by cadence is established for step length estimation. Compared to the traditional PDR navigation, experimental results showed that the error of navigation reduces 32.6%.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023813","afid":"60023813","affilname":"Shanghai University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56711481900","authid":"56711481900","authname":"Zhang H.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Honghui","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23391564400","authid":"23391564400","authname":"Zhang J.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Jinyi","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36987706800","authid":"36987706800","authname":"Zhou D.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Duo","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192617536","authid":"57192617536","authname":"Wang W.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Wei","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56919733800","authid":"56919733800","authname":"Li J.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Jianyu","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602788376","authid":"6602788376","authname":"Ran F.","surname":"Ran","given-name":"Feng","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193135116","authid":"57193135116","authname":"Ji Y.","surname":"Ji","given-name":"Yuan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]}],"article-number":"915837","source-id":"17700156304","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84939124964"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84939124964?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84939124964&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84939124964&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84939124964","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84939124964","eid":"2-s2.0-84939124964","dc:title":"Spatial Registration for a Three-Arm Robot Assisted Mandible Reconstruction Surgery","dc:creator":"Wang Y.","prism:publicationName":"Mathematical Problems in Engineering","prism:issn":"1024123X","prism:eIssn":"15635147","prism:volume":"2015","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2015","prism:doi":"10.1155/2015/689278","dc:description":"The three-arm surgical robot system assisted mandible reconstruction surgery (TMR-MRS) is developed to repair the mandible defects caused by congenital defect, trauma, or acquired disease.

The spatial registration based on quaternion is proposed to obtain the transformation relationship between four surgical subsystems. A method of hand-eye coordination is presented to control the end-effector of the robot arm to target position according to surgical planning. A least square error criterion is developed to optimize and compensate the hand-eye coordination method. In addition, the position of fibular implant in the robot space is calculated when it is grasped by end-effector of robot middle arm. Finally, the positioning accuracy tests and skull model experiments were conducted to evaluate the function of the surgical robot system. The results validate its feasibility and are consistent with the preoperative surgical planning.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016835","afid":"60016835","affilname":"Beijing Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55414766600","authid":"55414766600","authname":"Wang Y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Yonggui","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55646016600","authid":"55646016600","authname":"Duan X.","surname":"Duan","given-name":"Xingguang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]}],"article-number":"689278","source-id":"13082","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84938906906"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84938906906?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84938906906&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84938906906&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84938906906","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84938906906","eid":"2-s2.0-84938906906","dc:title":"Using quaternions to control assembly and adjustment mirror-prism optical systems","dc:creator":"Ezhova K.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of SPIE -

First, two sets of synchronous sampling data are used to construct the data covariance matrix, the array steering vector of the whole array is estimated using a quaternion eigenvalue decomposition of the data covariance matrix. Second, the direction cosine of the x-axis and y-axis are acquired by applying block operation to the spatial steering vectors, hence the estimates of two-dimensional DOA are obtained. Finally, the polarization parameters are estimated using the relationship between the dipole sub-array steering vectors of the x-axis and y-axis. The closed-form solutions for each parameter are obtained and parameters can automatically match. The simulation results verify that the performance of quaternion method is obviously better than that of the long-vector method.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025578","afid":"60025578","affilname":"Xidian University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/10042713200","authid":"10042713200","authname":"Wang L.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Lanmei","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56452424700","authid":"56452424700","authname":"Zou M.","surname":"Zou","given-name":"Minggao","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55827761200","authid":"55827761200","authname":"Wang G.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Guibao","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55826253100","authid":"55826253100","authname":"Chen Z.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Zhihai","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"}]}],"authkeywords":"Array signal processing | Collocated crossed dipole | Direction of arrival | ESPRIT | Polarization | Quaternion eigen-decomposition | Subspace theory","source-id":"18958","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84929455450"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84929455450?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84929455450&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84929455450&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84929455450","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84929455450","eid":"2-s2.0-84929455450","dc:title":"Blind watermarking scheme based on U matrix through QSVD transformation","dc:creator":"Liu F.","prism:publicationName":"International Journal of Security and its Applications","prism:issn":"17389976","prism:volume":"9","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"203-216","prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2015","prism:doi":"10.14257/ijsia.2015.9.4.19","dc:description":"In this paper, a novel blind color image watermarking technique using U matrix through QSVD transformation is proposed to protect the intellectual property rights of color images. The proposed method tries to insert the watermark through moderating the coefficient of the quaternion elements in U matrix. .In this method, the color image is considered as an array of pure quaternion numbers. Then the array of pure quaternion is divided into non-overlapping blocks and we perform QSVD to the block to get the U matrix. The watermarking is inserted into the coefficient of the quaternion elements in the first column of the U matrix. Besides, in the procedure of watermark insertion and extraction, ensuring higher fidelity and robustness and resilience to several possible image attacks have been considered. The experimental results showed that the proposed method performance created watermarked images with better PSNRs and more robustness versus several attacks such as Salt &Pepper noise, Brightness adjustment, Sharpen and Blurring and Clipping.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60108761","afid":"60108761","affilname":"NingboTech University","affiliation-city":"Ningbo","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026282","afid":"60026282","affilname":"Zhejiang University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Hangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/112881975","afid":"112881975","affilname":"Ningbo Baoxin Stainless Steel Co., Ltd.","affiliation-city":"Ningbo","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57199430564","authid":"57199430564","authname":"Liu F.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Feng","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026282"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60108761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35302377700","authid":"35302377700","authname":"Feng H.","surname":"Feng","given-name":"Hao","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026282"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56647184900","authid":"56647184900","authname":"Lu C.","surname":"Lu","given-name":"Chao","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"112881975"}]}],"authkeywords":"QSVD | Quaternion | U matrix | Watermarking","source-id":"21100199112","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84928647037"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84928647037?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84928647037&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84928647037&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84928647037","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84928647037","eid":"2-s2.0-84928647037","dc:title":"Smartphone-based indoor integrated WiFi/MEMS positioning algorithm in a multi-floor environment","dc:creator":"Tian Z.","prism:publicationName":"Micromachines","prism:eIssn":"2072666X","prism:volume":"6","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"347-363","prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2015","prism:doi":"10.3390/mi6030347","dc:description":"Indoor positioning in a multi-floor environment by using a smartphone is considered in this paper.

The proposed algorithm first relies on the gait detection approach and quaternion algorithm to estimate the velocity and heading angles of the target. Second, the velocity and heading angles, together with the results of WiFi fingerprinting-based positioning, are considered as the input of the robust EKF for the sake of conducting two-dimensional (2D) positioning. Third, the proposed algorithm calculates the height of the target by using the real-time recorded barometer and geographic data. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the positioning accuracy with root mean square errors (RMSEs) less than 1 m in an actual multi-floor environment.","citedby-count":"39","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020620","afid":"60020620","affilname":"Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55506175400","authid":"55506175400","authname":"Tian Z.","surname":"Tian","given-name":"Zengshan","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56609610700","authid":"56609610700","authname":"Fang X.","surname":"Fang","given-name":"Xin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55506126300","authid":"55506126300","authname":"Zhou M.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Mu","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56542108900","authid":"56542108900","authname":"Li L.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Lingxia","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]}],"authkeywords":"Extended Kalman filter | MEMS | Multi-floor positioning | WiFi fingerprinting","source-id":"21100229176","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84928612641"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84928612641?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84928612641&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84928612641&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84928612641","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84928612641","eid":"2-s2.0-84928612641","dc:title":"Extended Kalman filter for real time indoor localization by fusing WiFi and smartphone inertial sensors","dc:creator":"Deng Z.","prism:publicationName":"Micromachines","prism:eIssn":"2072666X","prism:volume":"6","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"523-543","prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2015","prism:doi":"10.3390/mi6040523","dc:description":"Indoor localization systems using WiFi received signal strength (RSS) or pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) both have their limitations, such as the RSS fluctuation and the accumulative error of PDR. To exploit their complementary strengths, most existing approaches fuse both systems by a particle filter. However, the particle filter is unsuitable for real time localization on resource-limited smartphones, since it is rather time-consuming and computationally expensive. On the other hand, the light computation fusion approaches including Kalman filter and its variants are inapplicable, since an explicit RSS-location measurement equation and the related noise statistics are unavailable. This paper proposes a novel data fusion framework by using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to integrate WiFi localization with PDR. To make EKF applicable, we develop a measurement model based on kernel density estimation, which enables accurate WiFi localization and adaptive measurement noise statistics estimation. For the PDR system, we design another EKF based on quaternions for heading estimation by fusing gyroscopes and accelerometers. Experimental results show that the proposed EKF based data fusion approach achieves significant localization accuracy improvement over using WiFi localization or PDR systems alone. Compared with a particle filter, the proposed approach achieves comparable localization accuracy, while it incurs much less computational complexity.","citedby-count":"99","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073606","afid":"60073606","affilname":"Nanjing Research Institute of Electronics Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029322","afid":"60029322","affilname":"Dalian Maritime University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35434952400","authid":"35434952400","authname":"Deng Z.","surname":"Deng","given-name":"Zhi An","initials":"Z.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029322"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25625194900","authid":"25625194900","authname":"Hu Y.","surname":"Hu","given-name":"Ying","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029322"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55682089300","authid":"55682089300","authname":"Yu J.","surname":"Yu","given-name":"Jianguo","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073606"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23390150000","authid":"23390150000","authname":"Na Z.","surname":"Na","given-name":"Zhenyu","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029322"}]}],"authkeywords":"Extended Kalman filter | Indoor localization | Inertial sensor | Wifi","source-id":"21100229176","fund-no":"61300188","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84928485499"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84928485499?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84928485499&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84928485499&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84928485499","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84928485499","eid":"2-s2.0-84928485499","dc:title":"Tensor representation of color images and fast 2-D quaternion discrete Fourier transform","dc:creator":"Grigoryan A.M.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","prism:issn":"0277786X","prism:eIssn":"1996756X","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781628414899"}],"prism:volume":"9399","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2015","prism:doi":"10.1117/12.2083199","dc:description":"In this paper, a general, efficient, split algorithm to compute the two-dimensional quaternion discrete Fourier transform (2-D QDFT), by using the special partitioning in the frequency domain, is introduced.
