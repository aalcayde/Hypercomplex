This is because of their advantages in (1) gathering the three-channel color information in a single feature vector while preserving the correlation between them and in (2) eliminating shape information redundancy. However, the computation of these quaternary orthogonal moments depends on a unit pure quaternion parameter. The optimal value of this latter can be fixed only with the help of experiments and it is application-dependent. We propose a parameter-free formulation of the quaternary orthogonal moments. The general formula for the computation of the proposed moments, whose rotation invariance is achieved by retaining the modulus, is provided. Furthermore, experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed modulus-based moment invariants for color image retrieval and recognition.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60117235","afid":"60117235","affilname":"Laboratoire Informatique et Modélisation, Université Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah","affiliation-city":"Fez","affiliation-country":"Morocco"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56819059100","authid":"56819059100","authname":"Dad N.","surname":"Dad","given-name":"Nisrine","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60117235"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221862377","authid":"57221862377","authname":"En-Nahnahi N.","surname":"En-Nahnahi","given-name":"Noureddine","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60117235"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36917833600","authid":"36917833600","authname":"Alaoui Ouatik S.E.","surname":"Alaoui Ouatik","given-name":"Said El","initials":"S.E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60117235"}]}],"authkeywords":"color image retrieval | Image moments | moments invariants | orthogonal moments | quaternion algebra","article-number":"011007","source-id":"25978","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85040133533"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85040133533?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85040133533&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85040133533&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85040133533","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85040133533","eid":"2-s2.0-85040133533","dc:title":"A robust color image watermarking algorithm against rotation attacks","dc:creator":"Han S.c.","prism:publicationName":"Optoelectronics Letters","prism:issn":"16731905","prism:eIssn":"19935013","prism:volume":"14","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"61-66","prism:coverDate":"2018-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 January 2018","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11801-018-7212-0","dc:description":"A robust digital watermarking algorithm is proposed based on quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) and discrete cosine transform (DCT) for copyright protection of color images.

The control objective of this research is to track a desired time-varying attitude of a satellite in the presence of inertia uncertainties and external disturbances, in order to be more suitable for implementation in a real-world application. In this investigation, the actuators are reaction wheels and the actuator dynamics are modelled in addition to the spacecraft dynamics. Thus, the control signal is DC motor voltage which is the most fundamental control variable and can be generated easily by a motor driver in practical cases. To achieve robust tracking of the desired time-varying attitude, a sliding mode controller is designed, and adaptive techniques are developed based on sliding mode control to overcome the inertia uncertainties and to estimate and compensate external disturbances. The kinematic equations of the satellite are expressed using quaternion parameters, and a novel control law will be derived by using a new facilitating approach in controller design, which is based on quaternion algebra, because of quaternion advantages, such as singularity rejection. Using this approach it will be more comfortable to deal with tedious mathematical operations, and on contrary with most of the previous studies, the terms corresponding to derivatives of the desired attitude are not neglected, and tracking capability is retained. The global stability of both methods (Sliding Mode Control (SMC) and adaptive sliding) is investigated using Lyapunov's stability theorem. In order to validate the control methods, first, Simulink-ADAMS co-simulation of a 3-DOF attitude control is used to verify the algorithm performance and integrity, and finally, the control strategy is implemented on the Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT) 3-DOF attitude simulator for different types of non-linear attitudes. Both co-simulation and implementation results clearly illustrate the designed attitude control algorithm's excellent performance in the various manoeuvres.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007751","afid":"60007751","affilname":"Amirkabir University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195559335","authid":"57195559335","authname":"Reza Alipour M.","surname":"Reza Alipour","given-name":"M.","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8986450600","authid":"8986450600","authname":"Fani Saberi F.","surname":"Fani Saberi","given-name":"F.","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23025008800","authid":"23025008800","authname":"Kabganian M.","surname":"Kabganian","given-name":"M.","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007751"}]}],"authkeywords":"actuator dynamics | adaptive-sliding control | attitude simulator | Nonlinear attitude tracking | quaternion algebra","source-id":"12444","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85034222730"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85034222730?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85034222730&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85034222730&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85034222730","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85034222730","eid":"2-s2.0-85034222730","dc:title":"A novel method to generate Wi-Fi fingerprint database based on MEMS","dc:creator":"Tian Z.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering","prism:issn":"18761100","prism:eIssn":"18761119","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789811032288"}],"prism:volume":"423","prism:pageRange":"19-27","prism:coverDate":"2018-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2018","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-981-10-3229-5_3","dc:description":"Fingerprint-based positioning in Wi-Fi environment has caught much attention recently.

Different from the conventional methods, the proposed one first relies on the gait detection approach and quaternion-based extend Kalman filter algorithm to estimate the velocity and heading of the target. Second, the Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) algorithm is used to calculate the current location of the target in a real-time manner, and meanwhile the data from Wi-Fi module are collected to generate the fingerprint database. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in positioning accuracy and efficient by saving the time and energy.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020620","afid":"60020620","affilname":"Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55506175400","authid":"55506175400","authname":"Tian Z.","surname":"Tian","given-name":"Zengshan","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189267033","authid":"57189267033","authname":"Wu Z.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Zipeng","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55506126300","authid":"55506126300","authname":"Zhou M.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Mu","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56584919400","authid":"56584919400","authname":"Li Z.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Ze","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56585074100","authid":"56585074100","authname":"Jin Y.","surname":"Jin","given-name":"Yue","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020620"}]}],"authkeywords":"Extend Kalman filter | Indoor localization | MEMS | PDR | Wi-Fi fingerprint database","source-id":"19700186822","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"IRT1299","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85034212584"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85034212584?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85034212584&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85034212584&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85034212584","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85034212584","eid":"2-s2.0-85034212584","dc:title":"Garage security system based on gyroscope","dc:creator":"Yimin H.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering","prism:issn":"18761100","prism:eIssn":"18761119","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789811032288"}],"prism:volume":"423","prism:pageRange":"1017-1027","prism:coverDate":"2018-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2018","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-981-10-3229-5_110","dc:description":"With the development of economy and technology, the types and quantity of vehicles are increasing which lead to security problems in storage.

In this paper we show that the same result is true if one removes the hypothesis Ω∩R≠∅ on the domain of the function f. Moreover we find that if a surface S⊂CP3 contains the image of the twistor lift of a slice regular function, then S has to be ruled by lines. Starting from these results we find all the projective classes of algebraic surfaces up to degree 3 in CP3 that contain the lift of a slice regular function. In addition we extend and further explore the so-called twistor transform, that is a curve in Gr2(C4) which, given a slice regular function, returns the arrangement of lines whose lift carries on. With the explicit expression of the twistor lift and of the twistor transform of a slice regular function we exhibit the set of slice regular functions whose twistor transform describes a rational line inside Gr2(C4), showing the role of slice regular functions not defined on R. At the end we study the twistor lift of a particular slice regular function not defined over the reals. This example shows the effectiveness of our approach and opens some questions.","citedby-count":"14","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031624","afid":"60031624","affilname":"Università Politecnica delle Marche","affiliation-city":"Ancona","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56041637600","authid":"56041637600","authname":"Altavilla A.","surname":"Altavilla","given-name":"Amedeo","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031624"}]}],"authkeywords":"Functions of hypercomplex variables | Rational and ruled surfaces | Slice regular functions | Twistor spaces","source-id":"23897","fund-acr":"INdAM","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica \"Francesco Severi\"","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85032337410"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85032337410?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85032337410&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85032337410&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85032337410","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85032337410","eid":"2-s2.0-85032337410","dc:title":"Quantifying the spatial position representation of gait through sensor fusion","dc:creator":"LeMoyne R.","prism:publicationName":"Smart Sensors, Measurement and Instrumentation","prism:issn":"21948402","prism:eIssn":"21948410","prism:volume":"27","prism:pageRange":"105-110","prism:coverDate":"2018-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2018","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-981-10-5684-0_8","dc:description":"Wearable and wireless systems equipped with the ability to mutually record the accelerometer and gyroscope signal can be applied to sensor fusion. Sensor fusion can provide the location of the inertial sensor with trajectory information, such as displacement, velocity, and acceleration as a function of time. In order to achieve the results of sensor fusion multiple subjects must be applied, such as the use of quaternion mathematics and orientation filtering. A traditional orientation filter is the Kalman filter; however, the gradient descent orientation filter offers a more computationally robust alternative that is suitable for wearable and wireless systems. The result information provided by sensor fusion is particularly useful for the assessment of gait trajectory. Sensor fusion is anticipated to enhance Network Centric Therapy with improved visualization of patient status.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023517","afid":"60023517","affilname":"Northern Arizona University","affiliation-city":"Flagstaff","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/112541157","afid":"112541157","affilname":"Independent","affiliation-city":"Pittsburgh","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"ch","subtypeDescription":"Book Chapter","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55902812400","authid":"55902812400","authname":"LeMoyne R.","surname":"LeMoyne","given-name":"Robert","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023517"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24466652800","authid":"24466652800","authname":"Mastroianni T.","surname":"Mastroianni","given-name":"Timothy","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"112541157"}]}],"authkeywords":"Accelerometer | Gait trajectory | Gradient descent orientation filter | Gyroscope | Inertial sensor | Kalman filter | Orientation filter | Quaternion | Sensor fusion | Zero velocity update","source-id":"21100826786","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85029532224"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85029532224?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85029532224&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85029532224&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85029532224","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85029532224","eid":"2-s2.0-85029532224","dc:title":"Enhancing Indoor Localization Using IoT Techniques","dc:creator":"Nabil M.","prism:publicationName":"Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing","prism:issn":"21945357","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783319648606"}],"prism:volume":"639","prism:pageRange":"885-894","prism:coverDate":"2018-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2018","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-64861-3_83","dc:description":"The connection of physical objects to the Internet makes it feasible to access remote sensor data and to control the physical world remotely.

The approach to obtain constraint equations via inverted chains however is rarely considered. We provide a detailed look on the constraint varieties of inverted chains, beginning with the basics of quaternion conjugation. The transformation of the Denavit- Hartenberg parameters needed for the quaternion conjugation is discussed in the paper. The quaternion conjugation is a fast way to obtain the variety corresponding to the inverted kinematic chain. Geometrically the conjugation is a reflection in the kinematic image space ℙ7 with respect to a line and a five- dimensional subspace. Some examples of constraint equations of kinematic chains and their inverted chains complete the paper.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009999","afid":"60009999","affilname":"Universität Innsbruck","affiliation-city":"Innsbruck","affiliation-country":"Austria"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191272266","authid":"57191272266","authname":"Stigger T.","surname":"Stigger","given-name":"Thomas","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009999"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6505996836","authid":"6505996836","authname":"Husty M.","surname":"Husty","given-name":"Manfred L.","initials":"M.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009999"}]}],"authkeywords":"Constraint equations | Dual quaternion conjugation | Inverted kinematic chains | Kinematic chains","source-id":"21100298603","fund-acr":"FWF","fund-no":"I 1750-N26","fund-sponsor":"Austrian Science Fund","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85025165483"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85025165483?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85025165483&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85025165483&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0165168417302451"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85025165483","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85025165483","eid":"2-s2.0-85025165483","dc:title":"Erratum to “Octonion Fourier Transform of real-valued functions of three variables – selected properties and examples” [Signal Process. 136 (2017) 29–37](S0165168416303358)(10.1016/j.sigpro.2016.11.021)","dc:creator":"Błaszczyk Ł.","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing","prism:issn":"01651684","prism:volume":"142","prism:pageRange":"149-151","prism:coverDate":"2018-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"January 2018","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.sigpro.2017.07.005","pii":"S0165168417302451","dc:description":"An error has been discovered in Section 6.2 of the article mentioned in title of this paper (one statement is true in some special cases but not in general).

A Fibonacci transform-based binary CGH technique that uses particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to improve the reconstructed image quality has been proposed to generate a hologram of a watermark. By use of QDCT, the host color image is treated holistically as a vector field. The component of the host color image after QDCT, which is suitable for embedding watermark, is analyzed. With SVD, the mark CGH is inserted into the host color image by modifying the U matrix. To embed the binary CGH, multiple embedding strength factors are used in this study. To withstand the geometric attacks, based on Zernike moment algorithm and invariant centroid, an improved geometric distortion detection algorithm is proposed. Considering the significant color information, this algorithm is performed on the color invariance model. To obtain better imperceptibility and robustness, PSO is used for finding the proper multiple embedding strength factors. Compared with traditional geometric estimation method, the improved algorithm can estimate the transform parameters of the geometric distorted color image more accurately. Experimental results show that the proposed color image watermarking is not only secure and invisible, but also robust against common image processing operations and geometrical distortions..","citedby-count":"33","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073499","afid":"60073499","affilname":"Hanshan Normal University","affiliation-city":"Chaozhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025345","afid":"60025345","affilname":"Guangzhou University","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018205","afid":"60018205","affilname":"Xiamen University","affiliation-city":"Xiamen","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35069699100","authid":"35069699100","authname":"Li J.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Jianzhong","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073499"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36864658300","authid":"36864658300","authname":"Lin Q.","surname":"Lin","given-name":"Qun","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073499"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190880636","authid":"57190880636","authname":"Yu C.","surname":"Yu","given-name":"Chuying","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073499"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401875472","authid":"7401875472","authname":"Ren X.","surname":"Ren","given-name":"Xuechang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018205"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57112844300","authid":"57112844300","authname":"Li P.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Ping","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025345"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image watermarking | Computer-generated hologram | Geometric correction | Quaternion discrete cosine transform","source-id":"28554","fund-acr":"DEGP","fund-no":"2014A030310038","fund-sponsor":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
