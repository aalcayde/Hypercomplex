Radial harmonic Fourier moments (RHFMs) are one of such image descriptors based on a set of orthogonal projection bases, which outperform other moments because of their computational efficiency. However, the conventional computational framework of RHFMs produces geometric error and numerical integration error, which will affect the accuracy of RHFMs, thus degrading the image reconstruction performance. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a new computational framework of RHFMs, namely accurate quaternion radial harmonic Fourier moments (AQRHFMs), for color image processing, and also analyze the properties of AQRHFMs. Firstly, we propose a precise computation method of RHFMs to reduce the geometric and numerical errors. Secondly, by using the algebra of quaternions, we extend the accurate RHFMs to AQRHFMs in order to deal with the color images in a holistic manner. Experimental results show the proposed AQRHFMs achieve promising performance in image reconstruction and object recognition in both noise-free and noisy conditions.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010080","afid":"60010080","affilname":"Nanjing University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/105557632","afid":"105557632","affilname":"National Ocean Technology Center","affiliation-city":"Tianjin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56604552600","authid":"56604552600","authname":"Liu Y.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Yunan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010080"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36620714700","authid":"36620714700","authname":"Zhang S.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Shanshan","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010080"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216506351","authid":"57216506351","authname":"Li G.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Guangyu","initials":"G."},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55688960000","authid":"55688960000","authname":"Wang H.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Houjun","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"105557632"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57251413500","authid":"57251413500","authname":"Yang J.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Jian","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010080"}]}],"authkeywords":"Geometric error | Numerical error | Object recognition | Quaternion | Radial harmonic Fourier moments","source-id":"24822","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"2018QNRC001","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85095862933"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85095862933?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85095862933&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85095862933&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85095862933","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85095862933","eid":"2-s2.0-85095862933","dc:title":"Quaternion-Based Self-Attentive Long Short-term User Preference Encoding for Recommendation","dc:creator":"Tran T.","prism:publicationName":"International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, Proceedings","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781450368599"}],"prism:pageRange":"1455-1464","prism:coverDate":"2020-10-19","prism:coverDisplayDate":"19 October 2020","prism:doi":"10.1145/3340531.3411926","dc:description":"Quaternion space has brought several benefits over the traditional Euclidean space: Quaternions (i) consist of a real and three imaginary components, encouraging richer representations; (ii) utilize Hamilton product which better encodes the inter-latent interactions across multiple Quaternion components; and (iii) result in a model with smaller degrees of freedom and less prone to overfitting. Unfortunately, most of the current recommender systems rely on real-valued representations in Euclidean space to model either user's long-term or short-term interests. In this paper, we fully utilize Quaternion space to model both user's long-term and short-term preferences. We first propose a QUaternion-based self-Attentive Long term user Encoding (QUALE) to study the user's long-term intents. Then, we propose a QUaternion-based self-Attentive Short term user Encoding (QUASE) to learn the user's short-term interests. To enhance our models' capability, we propose to fuse QUALE and QUASE into one model, namely QUALSE, by using a Quaternion-based gating mechanism. We further develop Quaternion-based Adversarial learning along with the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (QABPR) to improve our model's robustness. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets show that our fused QUALSE model outperformed 11 state-of-the-art baselines, improving 8.43% at HIT@1 and 10.27% at NDCG@1 on average compared with the best baseline.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011410","afid":"60011410","affilname":"Worcester Polytechnic Institute","affiliation-city":"Worcester","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195670708","authid":"57195670708","authname":"Tran T.","surname":"Tran","given-name":"Thanh","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011410"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211943867","authid":"57211943867","authname":"You D.","surname":"You","given-name":"Di","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011410"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55587884200","authid":"55587884200","authname":"Lee K.","surname":"Lee","given-name":"Kyumin","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011410"}]}],"authkeywords":"adversarial training. | long-term and short-term user preferences | quaternion-based attention | quaternion-based recommenders","source-id":"21101027248","fund-acr":"NSF","fund-no":"CNS-1755536","fund-sponsor":"National Science Foundation","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099533848"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099533848?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85099533848&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85099533848&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099533848","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85099533848","eid":"2-s2.0-85099533848","dc:title":"Nonlinear control of maneuvering fixed wing UAVs using quaternion logarithm","dc:creator":"Bodo Z.","prism:publicationName":"2020 23rd IEEE International Symposium on Measurement and Control in Robotics, ISMCR 2020","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781665404792"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-10-15","prism:coverDisplayDate":"15 October 2020","prism:doi":"10.1109/ISMCR51255.2020.9263760","dc:description":"The paper deals with the orientation and position control of maneuvering fixed wing UAVs.

Cameras mounted to capture high resolution images on the drone is a unique drone design feature. A large amount of video data is to be processed. Therefore it is important to analyze the gimbal design unit which stabilizes the camera during drone navigation. This can be achieved through hardware unit design and the software processing module which stabilizes the drone camera for horizontal view always. This paper presents the implementation of complementary filter using quaternion angles to mitigate the gimbal lock occurrence. The analysis of gyroscope drift issue and the accelerometer jitter issue discussed, forms the strong base to obtain knowledge to design the complementary filter. This motivates the need for using the low pass filter at the output of the accelerometer angle computation unit, to remove the jitter. It also facilitates the use of high pass filter after the gyroscope data computing process to remove the low frequency noise generated by the drift phenomenon. The mathematical model for the complementary filter illustrated highlights the need for use of quaternion angles, instead of Euler angles to keep track of the drone's position during navigation. Sensor data is obtained for gyroscope and accelerometer interfaced to an ATmega processing unit.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010618","afid":"60010618","affilname":"Vellore Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Vellore","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/115031932","afid":"115031932","affilname":"CEO","affiliation-city":"New Delhi","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57214839859","authid":"57214839859","authname":"Mansur V.","surname":"Mansur","given-name":"Vandana","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010618"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57220032438","authid":"57220032438","authname":"Reddy S.","surname":"Reddy","given-name":"Srinivasulu","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"115031932"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58023527800","authid":"58023527800","authname":"Sujatha R.","surname":"Sujatha","given-name":"R.","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010618"}]}],"authkeywords":"Accelerometer | Complementary filter | Drone | Gimbal | Gyroscope","article-number":"9231126","source-id":"21101028310","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85091090082"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85091090082?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85091090082&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85091090082&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85091090082","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85091090082","eid":"2-s2.0-85091090082","dc:title":"Positive maps from irreducibly covariant operators","dc:creator":"Kopszak P.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical","prism:issn":"17518113","prism:eIssn":"17518121","prism:volume":"53","prism:issueIdentifier":"39","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-10-02","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2 October 2020","prism:doi":"10.1088/1751-8121/abaa04","dc:description":"In this paper, we discuss positive maps induced by (irreducibly) covariant linear operators for finite groups. The application of group theory methods allows deriving some new results of a different kind. In particular, a family of necessary conditions for positivity, for such objects is derived, stemming either from the definition of a positive map or the novel method inspired by the inverse reduction map. In the low-dimensional cases, for the permutation group S(3) and the quaternion group Q, the necessary and sufficient conditions are given, together with the discussion on their decomposability. In higher dimensions, we present positive maps induced by a three-dimensional irreducible representation of the permutation group S(4) and d-dimensional representation of the monomial unitary group MU(d). In the latter case, we deliver if and only if condition for the positivity and compare the results with the method inspired by the inverse reduction. We show that the generalised Choi map can be obtained by considered covariant maps induced by the monomial unitary group. As an additional result, a novel interpretation of the Fujiwara-Algolet conditions for positivity and complete positivity is presented. Finally, in the end, a new form of an irreducible representation of the symmetric group S(n) is constructed, allowing us to simplify the form of certain Choi-Jamiołkowski images derived for irreducible representations of the symmetric group.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026000","afid":"60026000","affilname":"Uniwersytet Gdanski","affiliation-city":"Gdańsk","affiliation-country":"Poland"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016147","afid":"60016147","affilname":"University of Wroclaw","affiliation-city":"Wroclaw","affiliation-country":"Poland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219028688","authid":"57219028688","orcid":"0000-0003-3594-3562","authname":"Kopszak P.","surname":"Kopszak","given-name":"Piotr","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016147"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602259675","authid":"6602259675","orcid":"0000-0003-1905-7595","authname":"Mozrzymas M.","surname":"Mozrzymas","given-name":"Marek","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016147"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55222055000","authid":"55222055000","orcid":"0000-0002-5946-9845","authname":"Studziński M.","surname":"Studziński","given-name":"Michał","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026000"}]}],"authkeywords":"entanglement witness | group covariance | irreducible representation | positive maps","article-number":"395306","source-id":"5700165208","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherhybridgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Hybrid Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85098672007"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85098672007?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85098672007&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85098672007&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85098672007","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85098672007","eid":"2-s2.0-85098672007","dc:title":"Quaternion Harris for Multispectral Keypoint Detection","dc:creator":"Sfikas G.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - International Conference on Image Processing, ICIP","prism:issn":"15224880","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781728163956"}],"prism:volume":"2020-October","prism:pageRange":"11-15","prism:coverDate":"2020-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"October 2020","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICIP40778.2020.9191302","dc:description":"We present a new keypoint detection method that generalizes Harris corners for multispectral images by considering the input as a quaternionic matrix.

The proposed approach relies on a local geometry variation analysis in multi-channel images. Derivative filters are used to estimate the image gradient and a suitable representation of geometric color features is introduced. A gradient norm is provided as an intermediate hash, so we compute subsequently the magnitude of the Fourier spectrum in order to provide a final hash. The aim is to preserve accurately the structural information along with smoothing operations. We conduct experiments on the CASIA-V2 database for the tampering detection task, and the UCID database to demonstrate the hash robustness. We use the metrics of true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) to investigate the performance of the proposed method. A comparison is carried out using two corresponding schemes; the first operates on the quaternion discrete Fourier transform (QDFT) to take into account the image color planes, and the second exploits this transform into the log-polar domain. According to the TPR results, our method is quite robust against different content-preserving operations applied on the UCID database with regard to a predefined threshold. The FPR results over CASIA-V2 further demonstrate a superior capability of the proposed approach in detecting image forgeries.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013717","afid":"60013717","affilname":"La Rochelle Université","affiliation-city":"La Rochelle","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55843794800","authid":"55843794800","authname":"Rouis K.","surname":"Rouis","given-name":"Kais","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013717"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55318882300","authid":"55318882300","authname":"Gomez-Kramer P.","surname":"Gomez-Kramer","given-name":"Petra","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013717"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25631940800","authid":"25631940800","authname":"Coustaty M.","surname":"Coustaty","given-name":"Mickael","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013717"}]}],"authkeywords":"image gradient | Image hashing | local geometric features | tampering detection","article-number":"9190762","source-id":"144684","fund-acr":"ANR","fund-no":"2017-1R50108-00013407","fund-sponsor":"Agence Nationale de la Recherche","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85098645453"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85098645453?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85098645453&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85098645453&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85098645453","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85098645453","eid":"2-s2.0-85098645453","dc:title":"Deformable Quaternion Gabor Convolutional Neural Network for Color Facial Expression Recognition","dc:creator":"Jin L.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - International Conference on Image Processing, ICIP","prism:issn":"15224880","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781728163956"}],"prism:volume":"2020-October","prism:pageRange":"1696-1700","prism:coverDate":"2020-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"October 2020","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICIP40778.2020.9191349","dc:description":"In facial expression recognition (FER), convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown great capability of learning features.

Hence, it is recommended to develop new approaches that are able to represent and retrieve the BMC images efficiently. This work proposes two methods to represent BMC images: Quaternion Associated Laguerre. Moments (Q-ALMs), and Quaternion Chebyshev Moments (Q-CMs). Q-ALMs and Q-CMs are derived by extending the ALMs and CMs to the quaternion field. ALMs and CMs represent discrete orthogonal moments, and they are defined using the Associated Laguerre Polynomials (ALPs) and Chebychev Polynomials, respectively. Hospitals and medical institutes everywhere in the world create and store a large variety of datasets of BMC images during the routine clinical practices; hence, the mastery to retrieve the BMC images correctly is crucial for precise diagnoses and also for the researchers in medical sciences. So that in this study, we also introduced two image retrieval systems for BMC images based on the Q-CMs and Q-ALMs approaches. Our approaches extensively assessed with two standard benchmark datasets: LGG Segmentation dataset for brain magnetic resonance MR images and NEMA-CT for the computed tomography (CT) images.

This paper investigates a secure and robust cryptosystem for color image based on discrete trinion Fourier transform and random-multiresolution singular value decomposition. Firstly, a color image is represented into a trinion matrix by precoding and followed by block-wise discrete trinion Fourier transform. Then a mapping from trinion number domain to real number domain is implemented to facilitate random-multiresolution singular value decomposition. To further enhance the randomness of the transformed data, the scrambling based on chaotic sequence is applied to obtain the cipherimage. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed color image encryption algorithm is feasible. The adoption of logistic map ensures that the proposed cryptosystem attains high level security. Furthermore, the quality of the retrieved image is better than that of the algorithm based on single color channel processing separately and quaternion matrix based algorithms when it is decrypted correctly or under Gaussian noise and shear attacks. Moreover, employing a trinion matrix to represent a color image is more compact than using quaternion matrix. It would have potential applications in digital image protection.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025709","afid":"60025709","affilname":"The University of Sydney","affiliation-city":"Sydney","affiliation-country":"Australia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022381","afid":"60022381","affilname":"Beijing Jiaotong University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020256","afid":"60020256","affilname":"Capital Normal University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013268","afid":"60013268","affilname":"Taiyuan University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Taiyuan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113687661","afid":"113687661","affilname":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Imaging Technology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211333027","authid":"57211333027","authname":"Yao Q.","surname":"Yao","given-name":"Qijun","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55849891700","authid":"55849891700","orcid":"0000-0002-4847-282X","authname":"Shao Z.","surname":"Shao","given-name":"Zhuhong","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101867863","authid":"7101867863","authname":"Shang Y.","surname":"Shang","given-name":"Yuanyuan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020256"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113687661"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56870698700","authid":"56870698700","authname":"Ding H.","surname":"Ding","given-name":"Hui","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56946383200","authid":"56946383200","authname":"Liu X.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Xilin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013268"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57646836600","authid":"57646836600","authname":"Zeng R.","surname":"Zeng","given-name":"Rui","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025709"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16069434400","authid":"16069434400","authname":"Tong Q.","surname":"Tong","given-name":"Qingbin","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022381"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image encryption | Discrete trinion Fourier transform | Logistic map | Multiresolution singular value decomposition","source-id":"25627","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"SQKM201810028018","fund-sponsor":"Beijing Municipal Excellent Talents Foundation","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85087926183"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85087926183?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85087926183&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85087926183&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0923596520301314"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85087926183","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85087926183","eid":"2-s2.0-85087926183","dc:title":"Color image watermark decoder by modeling quaternion polar harmonic transform with BKF distribution","dc:creator":"Liu Y.","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing: Image Communication","prism:issn":"09235965","prism:volume":"88","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"October 2020","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.image.2020.115946","pii":"S0923596520301314","dc:description":"It still remains a challenging problem to improve both of the imperceptibility and robustness for the digital image watermarking task. In this study, a color image watermarking scheme is proposed based on quaternion polar harmonic transform (QPHT) with maximum likelihood decoder, which better balances imperceptibility and robustness in a novel fashion. Thanks to the strong robustness of QPHT, the digital watermark is embedded into the QPHT magnitudes using a multiplicative approach. At the receiver, the watermark decoder can be formulated as a problem of weak signal detection, as the QPHT magnitudes are highly non-Gaussian. In view of this, selection of proper models is of great importance to construct a suitable watermark decoder. Further, we validate that the probability density function of Bessel K form suitably models the heavy tail behavior of QPHT magnitudes, and thus the maximum likelihood decoder is developed by modeling QPHT magnitudes with Bessel K form distribution. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach provides better imperceptibility and robustness against various kinds of attacks compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.","citedby-count":"27","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010080","afid":"60010080","affilname":"Nanjing University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56604552600","authid":"56604552600","authname":"Liu Y.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Yunan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010080"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36620714700","authid":"36620714700","authname":"Zhang S.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Shanshan","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010080"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57251413500","authid":"57251413500","authname":"Yang J.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Jian","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010080"}]}],"authkeywords":"Bessel K form distribution | Color image watermarking | Maximum likelihood decoder | Quaternion polar harmonic transforms","article-number":"115946","source-id":"13803","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"WDZC20195500106","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85084953679"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85084953679?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85084953679&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85084953679&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S016516842030195X"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85084953679","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85084953679","eid":"2-s2.0-85084953679","dc:title":"Multi-image compression-encryption scheme based on quaternion discrete fractional Hartley transform and improved pixel adaptive diffusion","dc:creator":"Ye H.S.","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing","prism:issn":"01651684","prism:volume":"175","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"October 2020","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.sigpro.2020.107652","pii":"S016516842030195X","dc:description":"A new multi-image encryption scheme based on quaternion discrete fractional Hartley transform (QDFrHT) and an improved pixel adaptive diffusion is proposed, which can simultaneously increase the encryption capacity and reduce the consumption of keys.

The original images are compressed into four fusion images by discrete cosine transform (DCT) and Zigzag operations and then the resulting four images are represented as quaternion algebra. Afterward, the quaternion signal is processed with the proposed QDFrHT and the double random phase encoding technique. To enhance the security of the algorithm, the plaintext-related pixel adaptive diffusion and the pixel scrambling operation based on chaotic systems are followed to obtain the final encryption image. Different from the traditional cryptosystem whose secret keys are dependent on the plaintext, the designed cryptosystem ensures the sensitivity of the cryptosystem to plaintext while the selection of the secret keys is independent on plaintext by introducing an improved diffusion mechanism.

The key advantage of such an approach is the ability to guard against the local desynchronization attacks. However, research in this area usually suffers from the following limitations: (1) The feature points focus too much on the high contrast region and are distributed unevenly. (2) The feature point detector is sensitive to the texture region, and some noise feature points are always detected in the texture region. Based on superpixel image segmentation and quaternion wavelet transform, we propose a digital image watermarking approach which is highly robust against common image processing operations and local geometric transformations. First, the entropy rate superpixel segmentation is used to segment the host image into several homogeneous regions. Then, for each segment region, image feature points are extracted using the SIFER detector, and the affine invariant local regions are constructed adaptively. Finally, the digital watermark is embedded into the local regions by modulating the invariant modulus coefficients. Experimental results are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed image watermarking, especially for noise attacks and local desynchronization attacks.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017010","afid":"60017010","affilname":"Liaoning Normal University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16205443400","authid":"16205443400","authname":"Niu P.p.","surname":"Niu","given-name":"Pan pan","initials":"P.p.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209282355","authid":"57209282355","authname":"Wang L.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Li","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57215827554","authid":"57215827554","authname":"Shen X.","surname":"Shen","given-name":"Xin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202335087","authid":"57202335087","authname":"Zhang S.y.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Si yu","initials":"S.y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972239800","authid":"34972239800","authname":"Wang X.y.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiang yang","initials":"X.y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]}],"authkeywords":"Image watermarking | Local desynchronization attacks | Quaternions wavelet transform | SIFER detector | Superpixel segmentation","source-id":"12409","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"LZ2019001","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85079450676"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85079450676?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85079450676&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85079450676&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85079450676","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85079450676","eid":"2-s2.0-85079450676","dc:title":"A generalization of the octonion Fourier transform to 3-D octonion-valued signals: properties and possible applications to 3-D LTI partial differential systems","dc:creator":"Błaszczyk Ł.","prism:publicationName":"Multidimensional Systems and Signal Processing","prism:issn":"09236082","prism:eIssn":"15730824","prism:volume":"31","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"1227-1257","prism:coverDate":"2020-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2020","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11045-020-00706-3","dc:description":"The paper is devoted to the development of the octonion Fourier transform (OFT) theory initiated in 2011 in articles by Hahn and Snopek. It is also a continuation and generalization of earlier work by Błaszczyk and Snopek, where they proved few essential properties of the OFT of real-valued functions, e.g. symmetry properties. The results of this article focus on proving that the OFT is well-defined for octonion-valued functions and almost all well-known properties of classical (complex) Fourier transform (e.g. argument scaling, modulation and shift theorems) have their direct equivalents in octonion setup. Those theorems, illustrated with some examples, lead to the generalization of another result presented in earlier work, i.e. Parseval and Plancherel Theorems, important from the signal and system processing point of view. Moreover, results presented in this paper associate the OFT with 3-D LTI systems of linear PDEs with constant coefficients. Properties of the OFT in context of signal-domain operations such as derivation and convolution of R-valued functions will be stated. There are known results for the QFT, but they use the notion of other hypercomplex algebra, i.e. double-complex numbers. Considerations presented here require defining other higher-order hypercomplex structure, i.e. quadruple-complex numbers. This hypercomplex generalization of the Fourier transformation provides an excellent tool for the analysis of 3-D LTI systems.","citedby-count":"17","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003675","afid":"60003675","affilname":"Politechnika Warszawska","affiliation-city":"Warsaw","affiliation-country":"Poland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56007862100","authid":"56007862100","orcid":"0000-0002-9827-3562","authname":"Błaszczyk Ł.","surname":"Błaszczyk","given-name":"Łukasz","initials":"Ł.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003675"}]}],"authkeywords":"Cayley–Dickson numbers | Hypercomplex algebras | Multidimensional linear time-invariant systems | Octonion Fourier transform","source-id":"12409","fund-acr":"NCN","fund-no":"2016/23/N/ST7/00131","fund-sponsor":"Narodowe Centrum Nauki","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherhybridgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Hybrid Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85096244187"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85096244187?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85096244187&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85096244187&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85096244187","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85096244187","eid":"2-s2.0-85096244187","dc:title":"High performance multiplier-less pipelined FPGA architecture for 2-D non-separable quaternionic filter banks","dc:creator":"Rybenkov E.V.","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing - Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications Conference Proceedings, SPA","prism:issn":"23260262","prism:eIssn":"23260319","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9788362065394"}],"prism:volume":"2020-September","prism:pageRange":"42-47","prism:coverDate":"2020-09-23","prism:coverDisplayDate":"23 September 2020","dc:description":"This paper presents a systematic design of the 2-D non-separable quaternionic paraunitary filter banks (Q-PUFB) based on the integer-to-integer invertible quaternionic multiplier applied to image processing.

In particular, the motion and parameter estimation of an uncooperative target is a challenging task because of the lack of some prior information about the target in unfamiliar environments. In this paper, a novel method is developed for an accurate estimation of the motion and inertial parameters of an unknown target using stereo vision measurements only. Instead of using relative position and pose as observation information, this paper chooses three non-collinear feature points on the target as estimation measurements. This treatment allows us to estimate the principal axis of inertia of the target directly, and avoid estimating the quaternion between the target measurement coordinate system and the principal axis of inertia coordinate system, which is a bilinear problem, and is difficult to obtain global convergence. Based on the relative kinematics and dynamics equations of the target, the state equation and observation equation are derived, and the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is designed. As a result, the developed algorithm realizes the estimation of the complete unknown information of the target, including relative position, relative velocity, attitude quaternion, angular velocity, the direction of the principal axis of inertia, inertia ratio, and the position of center of mass. Numerical simulations and experimental results verify the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed filter estimation method.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60102437","afid":"60102437","affilname":"China Academy of Space Technology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36466416300","authid":"36466416300","authname":"Ge D.","surname":"Ge","given-name":"Dongming","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102437"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57223662725","authid":"57223662725","authname":"Wang D.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Dayi","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102437"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402166747","authid":"7402166747","authname":"Zou Y.","surname":"Zou","given-name":"Yuanjie","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102437"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57207823477","authid":"57207823477","authname":"Shi J.","surname":"Shi","given-name":"Jixin","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102437"}]}],"authkeywords":"Inertial parameters | Motion estimation | Non-cooperative target | Stereo vision","source-id":"12375","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61203093","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85100932594"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85100932594?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85100932594&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85100932594&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85100932594","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85100932594","eid":"2-s2.0-85100932594","dc:title":"A Quaternion-based Approach to Estimate Respiratory Rate from the Vectorcardiogram","dc:creator":"Romero D.","prism:publicationName":"Computing in Cardiology","prism:issn":"23258861","prism:eIssn":"2325887X","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781728173825"}],"prism:volume":"2020-September","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-09-13","prism:coverDisplayDate":"13 September 2020","prism:doi":"10.22489/CinC.2020.382","dc:description":"A novel ECG-derived respiration (EDR) approach is presented to efficiently estimate the respiratory rate. It combines spatial rotations and magnitude variations of the heart's electrical vector due to respiration. Orthogonal leads X, Y and Z from 10 volunteers were analyzed during a tilt table test. The largest vector magnitude (VM) within each QRS loop was assessed, and its 3D coordinates were converted into unit quaternion qb. Angular distances between these quaternions and the axes of the reference coordinate system, ?x, ?y and ?z, were then computed as EDR signals to track their relative variations caused by respiration. The respiratory rate was estimated on the spectrum of individual EDR signals obtained from the angular distances and VM time-series, but also on EDR signals obtained by principal component analysis (PCA). Relative errors (eR) to the reference respiratory signal exhibited relatively low values. The combination of EDR signals' spectrum {?X,?Y,?Z, VM} (eR=0.63±4.15%) and individual signals derived from ?X (eR =0.46±8.22%) and PCA (eR=0.36±6.58%) achieved the overall best results. The proposed method represents a computationally efficient alternative to other EDR approaches, but its robustness should be further investigated.

This method combines quaternion with non-local similarity priors and introduces quaternion Mahalanobis distance. Firstly, the Mahalanobis distance between the image patches is calculated in the eigenspace by singular value decomposition of quaternion since the Mahalanobis distance is not robust in the sample space. Secondly, the image data is analyzed with the principal component analysis method, thus the Mahalanobis distance equation is simplified. The image with noise affected by high noise was first processed with a Gaussian low pass filter (LPF). Experimental results show that the noise reduction effect of this method is better than the non-local means (NLM), generalized non-local Means (GNLM) and QNLM methods. The proposed algorithm can effectively eliminate image noise and efficiently improve the image visual effect.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018273","afid":"60018273","affilname":"University of Science and Technology Beijing","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219180508","authid":"57219180508","authname":"Xu X.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Xudong","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018273"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13805447400","authid":"13805447400","authname":"Zhao J.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Jinling","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018273"}]}],"authkeywords":"color image denoising | Non-local similarity | Quaternion Mahalanobis distance | Quaternion Mahalanobis non-local means (QMNLM)","article-number":"012046","source-id":"130053","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"2017YFF0207401","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85123040655"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85123040655?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85123040655&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85123040655&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85123040655","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85123040655","eid":"2-s2.0-85123040655","dc:title":"Proceedings of the 11th SETN Conference on Artificial Intelligence, SETN 2020","prism:publicationName":"ACM International Conference Proceeding Series","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781450388788"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-09-02","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2 September 2020","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 35 papers.

Color images with or without an additional infrared or depth channel are some of the use-cases that can be handled by the proposed descriptor. Standard keypoint descriptors employ single-channel input gradients, thereby discarding potentially useful content. The proposed descriptor is based on a quaternionic representation of the input image thereby treating each pixel multispectral value holistically. Coupled with a suitable multispectral quaternionic detector, we show that the proposed detector leads to superior experimental results on a keypoint matching scenario.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/122074618","afid":"122074618","affilname":"Information Technologies Institute","affiliation-city":"Ioannina","affiliation-country":"Greece"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36893579300","authid":"36893579300","authname":"Sfikas G.","surname":"Sfikas","given-name":"Giorgos","initials":"G."},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/19638392200","authid":"19638392200","authname":"Ioannidis D.","surname":"Ioannidis","given-name":"Dimosthenis","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"122074618"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13105681700","authid":"13105681700","authname":"Tzovaras D.","surname":"Tzovaras","given-name":"Dimitrios","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"122074618"}]}],"authkeywords":"Harris corners | Polar representation | Quaternions | SIFT","article-number":"3411417","source-id":"11600154611","fund-acr":"H2020","fund-no":"774478","fund-sponsor":"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85090428101"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85090428101?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85090428101&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85090428101&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85090428101","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85090428101","eid":"2-s2.0-85090428101","dc:title":"Fabric defect detection based on illumination correction and visual salient features","dc:creator":"Di L.","prism:publicationName":"Sensors (Switzerland)","prism:issn":"14248220","prism:volume":"20","prism:issueIdentifier":"18","prism:pageRange":"1-21","prism:coverDate":"2020-09-02","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2 September 2020","prism:doi":"10.3390/s20185147","dc:description":"Aiming at the influence of uneven illumination on fabric feature extraction and the limitations of traditional frequency-based visual saliency algorithms, we propose a fabric defect detection method based on the combination of illumination correction and visual salient features—(1) Construct a multi-scale side window box (MS-BOX) filter to extract the illumination component of the image, then use the constructed two-dimensional gamma correction function to perform illumination correction on the image in the global angle, and finally enhance the local contrast of the image in the local angle; (2) Use the L0 gradient minimization method to remove the background texture of fabric images and highlight the defects; (3) Represent the fabric image as a quaternion image, where each pixel in the image is represented by a quaternion consisting of color, intensity and edge characteristics.

To eliminate the influence of magnetic interference on the attitude angle in the quaternion and reduce the heading deviation of the multi-rotor aircraft, a method based on extended Kalman filter is proposed to estimate the attitude and heading information, respectively. According to the magnetic induction intensity of the geomagnetic field and the angle between the geomagnetic field and gravity, an adjustable measurement noise variance matrix is established to adaptively modify the course of the multi-rotor aircraft, which is based on the magnetic induction intensity of the geomagnetic field and the angle between the geomagnetic field and gravity. Meanwhile, to further improve the attitude estimation accuracy, sensor data output model is formulated and calibrated by using a three-dimensional turntable. Finally, experiments are implemented based on independently developed flight control systems. Experimental results show that the method can provide accurate attitude information for multi-rotor aircraft under magnetic interference environment, and the anti-magnetic interference performance is improved.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018326","afid":"60018326","affilname":"Shenyang Aerospace University","affiliation-city":"Shenyang","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56926983700","authid":"56926983700","authname":"Lu Y.","surname":"Lu","given-name":"Yanjun","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018326"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57220861110","authid":"57220861110","authname":"Chen Y.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Yudi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018326"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56928049300","authid":"56928049300","authname":"Zhang X.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Xiaodong","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018326"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35306194000","authid":"35306194000","authname":"Zhang T.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Taining","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018326"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude estimation | Extended Kalman filter | Magnetometer | Multi-rotor aircraft | Sensor calibration","source-id":"15597","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
