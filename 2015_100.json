The proposed algorithm is based on a design of a Maximum Posteriori Estimator (MAP) combined with a Quaternion Wavelet Transform (QWT) that utilizes the Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG) Probability Density Function (PDF). The QWT is a near shift-invariant whose coefficients include one magnitude and three phase values. An NIG PDF which is specified by four real-value parameters is capable of modeling the heavy-tailed QWT coefficients, and describing the intra-scale dependency between the QWT coefficients. The NIG PDF is applied as a prior probability distribution, to model the coefficients by utilizing the Bayesian estimation technique. Additionally, a simple and fast method is given to estimate the parameters of the NIG PDF from the neighboring QWT coefficients. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other existing denoising methods in terms of the PSNR, the structural similarity, and the edge preservation. It is clear that the proposed method can remove Gaussian white noise more effectively.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005244","afid":"60005244","affilname":"Southeast University","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35748407200","authid":"35748407200","authname":"Gai S.","surname":"Gai","given-name":"Shan","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55618730600","authid":"55618730600","authname":"Luo L.","surname":"Luo","given-name":"Limin","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]}],"authkeywords":"Image denoising | Maximum posterior estimator | Normal inverse Gaussian density | Quaternion wavelet transform","source-id":"25627","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61162002","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84922227652"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84922227652?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84922227652&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84922227652&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84922227652","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84922227652","eid":"2-s2.0-84922227652","dc:title":"Online burning material pile detection on color clustering and quaternion based edge detection in boiler","dc:creator":"Wang W.","prism:publicationName":"KSII Transactions on Internet and Information Systems","prism:issn":"19767277","prism:eIssn":"22881468","prism:volume":"9","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"190-207","prism:coverDate":"2015-01-31","prism:coverDisplayDate":"31 January 2015","prism:doi":"10.3837/tiis.2015.01.011","dc:description":"In the combustion engineering, to decrease pollution and increase production efficiency, and to optimally keep solid burning material amount constant in a burner online, it needs a smart method to detect the amount variation of the burning materials in a high temperature environment.

Previous methods for removing this ambiguity are based on analyzing the signal variation during one period of the carrier signals.

Since animated motions comprise of signals, it is no surprise that the Fourier transform has been used to filter animations by transforming joint signals from the spatial domain to the frequency domain and then applying filtering masks. However, in this paper, we filter motion signals by means of a new approach implemented using hyper-complex numbers, often referred to as Quaternions, to represent angular joint displacements. We use the novel quaternion Fourier transform (QFT) to perform filtering by allowing joint motions to be transformed as a 'whole', rather than as individual components. We propose a holistic Fourier transform of the joints to yield a single frequency-domain representation based on the quaternion Fourier coefficients. This opens the door to new types of motion filtering techniques. We apply the concept to the frequency domain for noise reduction of 3-dimensional motions. The approach is based on obtaining the QFT of the joint signals and applying Gaussian filters in the frequency domain. The filtered signals are then reconstructed using the inverse quaternion Fourier transform (IQFT).","citedby-count":"0","prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54391273900","authid":"54391273900","authname":"Kenwright B.","surname":"Kenwright","given-name":"Ben","initials":"B."}],"source-id":"21101021815","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054247175"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054247175?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85054247175&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85054247175&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054247175","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85054247175","eid":"2-s2.0-85054247175","dc:title":"High-dimensional kernel regression: A guide for practitioners","dc:creator":"Tobar F.","prism:publicationName":"Trends in Digital Signal Processing: A Festschrift in Honour of A.

Practical examples of the advantages of the HDK paradigm include multimodal wind prediction, body sensor trajectory tracking, and nonlinear function approximation.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031101","afid":"60031101","affilname":"University of Cambridge","affiliation-city":"Cambridge","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015150","afid":"60015150","affilname":"Imperial College London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book","subtype":"ch","subtypeDescription":"Book Chapter","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/51462344700","authid":"51462344700","authname":"Tobar F.","surname":"Tobar","given-name":"Felipe","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031101"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006513328","authid":"7006513328","authname":"Mandic D.P.","surname":"Mandic","given-name":"Danilo P.","initials":"D.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]}],"source-id":"21100953844","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85023777256"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85023777256?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85023777256&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85023777256&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85023777256","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85023777256","eid":"2-s2.0-85023777256","dc:title":"Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation, ACRA","prism:publicationName":"Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation, ACRA","prism:issn":"14482053","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2015","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 54 papers.

The underlying formulation is based on concepts of planar quaternions, kinematic mapping, and data-fitting. By formulating the kinematic constraints of planar four-bar linkages in a unified form and then fitting the constraints with the given motion data in the image space of planar displacements, we obtain the best type and the dimensions of the linkages.

The unintended vibrations due to tremor causes tip of the microsurgical tools to fluctuate unnecessarily causing unacceptable imprecisions in micro-surgeries. All the existing algorithms such as weighted Fourier Linear Combiner (wFLC), and its extensions, treat three x, y and z axes of tremor as three independent channels. However our correlation and coherence analysis showed that there is significant coupling between tremor channels. More importantly grip force by which a surgeon holds a surgical device also shows significant coupling with three tremor channels, which has never been investigated before. We first modelled the tremor in 3 dimensions (3-D) using quaternion algebra, and found 27% improvement which we have presented in our previous work. In this paper, we show modelling tremor in 4 dimensions by incorporating grip force and three tremor channels further exploits the cross-channel coupling information which is naturally inherent between force and xyz tremor channels. Using quaternion algebra we extract this coupling information to improve the tremor modelling performance. We show that estimation performance of tremor improves by 45% using 4-D model instead 3-D, yielding overall improvement of 65% from 1-D to 4-D.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012704","afid":"60012704","affilname":"Kyungpook National University","affiliation-city":"Daegu","affiliation-country":"South Korea"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006222","afid":"60006222","affilname":"Newcastle University","affiliation-city":"Newcastle","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56808983400","authid":"56808983400","authname":"Adhikari K.","surname":"Adhikari","given-name":"K.","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006222"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54947284700","authid":"54947284700","authname":"Tatinati S.","surname":"Tatinati","given-name":"S.","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012704"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8703318200","authid":"8703318200","authname":"Veluvolu K.C.","surname":"Veluvolu","given-name":"K.

The experiment was developed for the European Student Earth Orbiter (ESEO) satellite. This is the main educational project of the European Space Agency. Being a software-based payload, the experiment shall be loaded onto the satellite's OBDH. It uses sensor and control signal outputs to perform several spacecraft attitude tests in Low Earth Orbit. Four algorithms from different families of estimators are run in parallel and generate telemetry for further analysis and comparison. One of the four algorithms makes use of a maximum information rate filter which computes the information rates of six possible reduced measurement matrices. It selects one for use in the estimation process based on the maximum trace of the associated information rate matrix. The payload shall provide probability distributions for the selection of each different measurement matrix within the telemetry in order to determine the causality underlying the selection of a particular reduced measurement matrix based on features of the orbit and the used measurements. This paper explains the foundation of the attitude determination experiment by first demonstrating the algorithms that are tested. The validity of these algorithms for insitu use is shown through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. The software design is described, as well as the performance analysis results from testing on the actual satellite OBDH hardware. This includes memory usage reports, run-time testing results and code robustness verifications. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are performed in order to correlate the information-based reduced measurement selection with physical features of the simulated orbit and attitude. The proposed analysis is to be further validated by the actual payload during the ESEO mission.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027161","afid":"60027161","affilname":"Ben-Gurion University of the Negev","affiliation-city":"Beer Sheva","affiliation-country":"Israel"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006288","afid":"60006288","affilname":"Delft University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Delft","affiliation-country":"Netherlands"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004956","afid":"60004956","affilname":"Instituto Superior Técnico","affiliation-city":"Lisbon","affiliation-country":"Portugal"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56785568100","authid":"56785568100","authname":"Geers M.","surname":"Geers","given-name":"Martijn","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006288"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36127607900","authid":"36127607900","authname":"Kuiper H.","surname":"Kuiper","given-name":"Hans","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006288"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12778249200","authid":"12778249200","authname":"Choukroun D.","surname":"Choukroun","given-name":"Daniel","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027161"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56786504800","authid":"56786504800","authname":"Salvoldi M.","surname":"Salvoldi","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027161"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56786371500","authid":"56786371500","authname":"Rondao D.","surname":"Rondao","given-name":"Duarte","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004956"}]}],"source-id":"21100255701","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84991670400"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84991670400?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84991670400&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84991670400&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84991670400","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84991670400","eid":"2-s2.0-84991670400","dc:title":"Attitude determination for the unisat-6 microsatellite","dc:creator":"Battistini S.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC","prism:issn":"00741795","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781510818934"}],"prism:volume":"7","prism:pageRange":"5628-5635","prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2015","dc:description":"The Unisat-6 satellite was launched on the 19th of June, 2014. Its main mission was the in-orbit release of a number of on-board carried cubesats and the transmission to the Unisat-6 ground station of telemetry data and images from an on-board mounted camera. The release of the cubesats applied a torque to Unisat-6 and caused a redistribution of its inertia matrix, which of course had an impact on the attitude motion. The importance for future similar missions of a precise reconstruction of Unisat-6 attitude motion lies in the dual possibility of: controlling the direction of ejection of the on-board carried satellites; having an accurate pointing for remote sensing operation. The Unisat-6 satellite is equipped with a three-Axis magnetometer and a set of gyroscopes, which provide with information on the spacecraft's motion along the orbit. Moreover, it has a passive magnetic attitude control system. Sensors data are processed in order to reconstruct the attitude. To this end, a suitable filter has been implemented, which involves a quaternion representation for the attitude of the satellite. Generalized Rodrigues parameters are used in order to preserve the unitary norm property of the quaternions within the filter. This paper shows the reconstruction of the attitude of Unisat-6 using on-board measurements, and allows drawing important conclusions on Unisat-6 attitude motion and control.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60113495","afid":"60113495","affilname":"GAUSS Srl","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024989","afid":"60024989","affilname":"Universidade de Brasília","affiliation-city":"Brasilia","affiliation-country":"Brazil"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/41261064400","authid":"41261064400","authname":"Battistini S.","surname":"Battistini","given-name":"Simone","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024989"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25627559800","authid":"25627559800","authname":"Cappelletti C.","surname":"Cappelletti","given-name":"Chantal","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024989"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34769603100","authid":"34769603100","authname":"Graziani F.","surname":"Graziani","given-name":"Filippo","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60113495"}]}],"source-id":"21100255701","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988476218"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988476218?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84988476218&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84988476218&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988476218","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84988476218","eid":"2-s2.0-84988476218","dc:title":"Moving athlete detection for multimedia physical education","dc:creator":"Chen M.","prism:publicationName":"Open Cybernetics and Systemics Journal","prism:eIssn":"1874110X","prism:volume":"9","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"1922-1928","prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2015","prism:doi":"10.2174/1874110X01509011922","dc:description":"In the process of the multimedia physical education, the moving athlete detection is the key to tracking and recognizing the athlete.

However, since the scene of sports events is complicated, the background is commonly affected by the noise and illumination changes, making the background difficult to remove. In order to solve this problem, a novel motion saliency calculation based method is proposed for detecting the moving athlete in sport videos. In our method, four motion features, as the optic flows, direction vectors and frame difference are fused by the Quaternion Fast Fourier Transform. The motion saliency map is generated to identify the area of the moving athlete.

Therefore, image splicing detection has attracted more and more attention recently in digital forensics. Gray images are used directly, or color images are converted to gray images before processing in previous image splicing detection algorithms. However, most natural images are color images. In order to make use of the color information in images, a classification algorithm is put forward which can use color images directly. In this paper, an algorithm based on Markov in Quaternion discrete cosine transform (QDCT) domain is proposed for image splicing detection. The support vector machine (SVM) is exploited to classify the authentic and spliced images.

Creation of the fault detection algorithm requires the description of the complete set of the SINS algorithms, as well as the algorithms of the SINS correction via data processing of the GPS, magnetometer, and barometric altimeter signals.

The objective is to design an optimal reorientation trajectory for a rigid body spacecraft under constraints, which is originally formulated as a nonlinear programming problem. The attitude forbidden zones are considered to prevent the light-sensitive instruments operated on-board from exposure to bright light while the mandatory zone to keep the communication instrument in certain zones to transmit and receive signals. When unit quaternions are used to represent the attitude of spacecraft, the dynamics and constraints are formulated as quadratic functions. By discretizing the reorientation trajectory into discrete nodes, the optimal attitude control problem can be formulated as general quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP). Due to nonconvexity of general QCQP problems, the traditional semidefinite relaxation method can only obtain a bound on the optimal solution. In this paper, we proposed an iterative rank minimization approach to gradually reduce the gap between the bound and the optimal solution and will finally converges to the optima.

The low latency separable image processing is implemented in the given architecture.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60043973","afid":"60043973","affilname":"Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics","affiliation-city":"Minsk","affiliation-country":"Belarus"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56511553600","authid":"56511553600","authname":"Petrovsky N.","surname":"Petrovsky","given-name":"Nick","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60043973"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35265083400","authid":"35265083400","authname":"Stankevich A.","surname":"Stankevich","given-name":"Andrew","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60043973"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25937204400","authid":"25937204400","authname":"Petrovsky A.","surname":"Petrovsky","given-name":"Alexandr","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60043973"}]}],"authkeywords":"FPGA | lossless image coding","article-number":"7454573","source-id":"21100886232","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964931756"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964931756?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84964931756&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84964931756&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964931756","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84964931756","eid":"2-s2.0-84964931756","dc:title":"SURF Feature Description Method of Color Image Based on Quaternion","dc:creator":"Qian S.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - 2015 10th International Conference on Broadband and Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications, BWCCA 2015","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781467383158"}],"prism:pageRange":"507-511","prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2015","prism:doi":"10.1109/BWCCA.2015.7","dc:description":"To solve the problem of feature description in color image, in this paper, a novel method of SURF (speed up robust features) feature description of color image based on quaternion is proposed according to the influences of color information to image feature attribute.

An index based on the extracted features is calculated and proposed for breast tissue analysis. The results show that the features extracted using Riesz and quaternion Hilbert transform are able to discriminate normal and pathological conditions of breast tissues. The extracted features could capture the thermal variations among various abnormalities that are introduced due to varied metabolic conditions. Also, the index calculated using quaternion features is found to be statistically significant in distinguishing normal and carcinoma tissues. Hence, it appears that the proposed index using quaternion features can be useful for efficient diagnosis of breast pathologies.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60108956","afid":"60108956","affilname":"College of Engineering, Guindy","affiliation-city":"Chennai","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/119074319","afid":"119074319","affilname":"Non-Invasive Imaging and Diagnostics Laboratory","affiliation-city":"Chennai","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57200204600","authid":"57200204600","authname":"Prabha S.","surname":"Prabha","given-name":"S.","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60108956"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55813765700","authid":"55813765700","authname":"Sujatha C.M.","surname":"Sujatha","given-name":"C.

Specifically, linear and widely linear adaptive filter designs based on quaternion data have been presented in the literature. The benefit for quaternion-valued processing in particular includes performing data transformations in 3 or 4-dimensional space conveniently compared to vector algebra. The transformations are performed using quaternion addition and multiplication, which differs from real and complex-valued multiplication in that quaternion multiplication is non-commutative. Recently, new algorithms have been developed that outperform others for these kinds of problems.

Focus of human attention is directed towards the salient targets which interpret the most important information in the image. For the given registered infrared and visible images, firstly, visual features are extracted to obtain the input hypercomplex matrix. Secondly, the Hypercomplex Fourier Transform (HFT) is used to obtain the salient regions of the infrared and visible images respectively, the convolution of the input hypercomplex matrix amplitude spectrum with a low-pass Gaussian kernel of an appropriate scale which is equivalent to an image saliency detector are done. The saliency maps are obtained by reconstructing the 2D signal using the original phase and the amplitude spectrum, filtered at a scale selected by minimizing saliency map entropy. Thirdly, the salient regions are fused with the adoptive weighting fusion rules, and the nonsalient regions are fused with the rule based on region energy (RE) and region sharpness (RS), then the fused image is obtained. Experimental results show that the presented algorithm can hold high spectrum information of the visual image, and effectively get the thermal targets information at different scales of the infrared image.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025761","afid":"60025761","affilname":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010580","afid":"60010580","affilname":"China Three Gorges University","affiliation-city":"Yichang","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003028","afid":"60003028","affilname":"Wuhan Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55969075900","authid":"55969075900","authname":"Chen Y.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Yanfei","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003028"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23992706700","authid":"23992706700","authname":"Sang N.","surname":"Sang","given-name":"Nong","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24922764900","authid":"24922764900","authname":"Dan Z.","surname":"Dan","given-name":"Zhiping","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010580"}]}],"authkeywords":"Hypercomplex Fourier Transform(HFT) | image fusion | infrared | saliency","article-number":"98130G","source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84958039643"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84958039643?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84958039643&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84958039643&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84958039643","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84958039643","eid":"2-s2.0-84958039643","dc:title":"Towards the automatic motion recovery using single-view image sequences acquired from bike","dc:creator":"Kolecki J.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the 2015 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems, FedCSIS 2015","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9788360810651"}],"prism:pageRange":"199-207","prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2015","prism:doi":"10.15439/2015F182","dc:description":"This paper describes the design, implementation and results of the image-based ego-motion estimation algorithm.
