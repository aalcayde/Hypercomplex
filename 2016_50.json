The quaternion-based dynamical model of the GS is first derived, and then the influences of the reaction wheels in the GS structure, under the gravity gradient perturbation that causes a route to chaos through quasi-periodicity mechanism, is investigated. For the suppression of chaos in the system, a chaos control system with the quaternion feedback is designed for the GS based on the extension of the Ott-Grebogi-Yorke (OGY) method using the linearization of the Poincaré map. In the extended OGY controller, the Poincaré map is estimated using the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) technique. After linearization of the Poincaré map, the Discrete-time Linear Quadratic Regulator (DLQR) is applied on the linearized Poincaré map, making the DLQR-OGY controller for chaos. The DLQR-OGY control system stabilizes the orbits to the fixed points providing a small control input signal, which leads to a decrease in the control effort and energy consumption in the GS system.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027666","afid":"60027666","affilname":"Sharif University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016248","afid":"60016248","affilname":"K.

This quaternion domain Fourier transform (QDFT) transforms quaternion valued signals (for example electromagnetic scalar-vector potentials, color data, space-time data, etc.) defined over a quaternion domain (space-time or other 4D domains) from a quaternion position space to a quaternion frequency space. The QDFT uses the full potential provided by hypercomplex algebra in higher dimensions and may moreover be useful for solving quaternion partial differential equations or functional equations, and in crystallographic texture analysis. We define the QDFT and analyze its main properties, including quaternion dilation, modulation and shift properties, Plancherel and Parseval identities, covariance under orthogonal transformations, transformations of coordinate polynomials and differential operator polynomials, transformations of derivative and Dirac derivative operators, as well as signal width related to band width uncertainty relationships.","citedby-count":"16","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016348","afid":"60016348","affilname":"International Christian University","affiliation-city":"Mitaka","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8898269700","authid":"8898269700","authname":"Hitzer E.","surname":"Hitzer","given-name":"Eckhard","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016348"}]}],"authkeywords":"Fourier transform | Orthogonal transformations in three and four dimensions | Quaternionic differential operators | Quaternions | Signal and image processing | Uncertainty","source-id":"4900152804","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84944909145"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84944909145?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84944909145&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84944909145&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84944909145","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84944909145","eid":"2-s2.0-84944909145","dc:title":"Operator Exponentials for the Clifford Fourier Transform on Multivector Fields in Detail","dc:creator":"Eelbode D.","prism:publicationName":"Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras","prism:issn":"01887009","prism:eIssn":"16614909","prism:volume":"26","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"953-968","prism:coverDate":"2016-09-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 September 2016","prism:doi":"10.1007/s00006-015-0600-7","dc:description":"In this paper we study Clifford Fourier transforms (CFT) of multivector functions taking values in Clifford’s geometric algebra, hereby using techniques coming from Clifford analysis (the multivariate function theory for the Dirac operator).

One of the most commonly tampering with a digital image is copy-move forgery, in which a part of image is copied and used to cover another part in a different location in the same image. In this paper, we present an efficient and robust quaternion discrete cosine transform (QDCT) based method to detect this artifact. First, the R, G, B component of a tampered image is divided into overlapping fixed-size blocks, and a quaternion is constructed by using each R, G, B component block. Secondly, QDCT is applied to each quaternion block and using Zig-zag scanning extract finite QDCT coefficients, thus, the feature vectors are extracted from finite QDCT coefficients of overlapping blocks, and reduced features are generated. Finally, feature vectors are sorted lexicographically. The duplicated image blocks will be matched by a preset threshold value. Experiment results show that our proposed scheme can efficiently detect the copy-move forgery.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025945","afid":"60025945","affilname":"Lanzhou University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Lanzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023813","afid":"60023813","affilname":"Shanghai University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36699960500","authid":"36699960500","authname":"Li C.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Ce","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025945"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56912708600","authid":"56912708600","authname":"Ma Q.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Qiang","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025945"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/48261661600","authid":"48261661600","authname":"Xiao L.","surname":"Xiao","given-name":"Limei","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025945"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24451523300","authid":"24451523300","authname":"Ying S.","surname":"Ying","given-name":"Shihui","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023813"}]}],"authkeywords":"Copy-move forgery | Digital image forensics | QDCT | Region duplication detection","source-id":"11600154611","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84984621926"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84984621926?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84984621926&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84984621926&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84984621926","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84984621926","eid":"2-s2.0-84984621926","dc:title":"A semi-widely linear filtering algorithm for ℂ<sup>η</sup>-proper quaternion signals based on randomly modeled observations","dc:creator":"Lopez J.D.J.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications, SPAWC","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781509017492"}],"prism:volume":"2016-August","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2016-08-09","prism:coverDisplayDate":"9 August 2016","prism:doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2016.7536848","dc:description":"The problem of estimating a quaternion random signal is addressed under the condition of ℂη-properness.

The superiority of the proposed semi-widely linear filter over the conventional one is illustrated through a simulation example.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014586","afid":"60014586","affilname":"Universidad de Jaén","affiliation-city":"Jaen","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56589183200","authid":"56589183200","authname":"Lopez J.D.J.","surname":"Lopez","given-name":"Jose D.Jimenez","initials":"J.D.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014586"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6506232550","authid":"6506232550","authname":"Fernandez-Alcala R.M.","surname":"Fernandez-Alcala","given-name":"Rosa M.","initials":"R.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014586"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602299200","authid":"6602299200","authname":"Navarro-Moreno J.","surname":"Navarro-Moreno","given-name":"Jesus","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014586"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701415559","authid":"6701415559","authname":"Ruiz-Molina J.C.","surname":"Ruiz-Molina","given-name":"Juan C.","initials":"J.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014586"}]}],"article-number":"7536848","source-id":"21100777165","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84983784460"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84983784460?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84983784460&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84983784460&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84983784460","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84983784460","eid":"2-s2.0-84983784460","dc:title":"A novel color image hologram watermarking algorithm based on QDFT-DWT","dc:creator":"Xie Y.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the 28th Chinese Control and Decision Conference, CCDC 2016","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781467397148"}],"prism:pageRange":"4349-4354","prism:coverDate":"2016-08-03","prism:coverDisplayDate":"3 August 2016","prism:doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2016.7531749","dc:description":"In this paper, we propose a novel color image hologram watermark algorithm based on quaternion Fourier transform (QDFT) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT).

Quaternion be used in process color image spread image distortion that caused by watermark embed into three channels simultaneously rather than into only one channel and combined transform domain provides a more covert embedding area, that make the algorithm have a good performance in invisibility.

A simplified strapdown inertial mechanization is used to predict the orientation and position of the user while the measurements of the visual odometry are employed to reduce the fast position drift of a pure inertial approach. Within the work the relative orientation and position measurements are considered as a generalized displacement represented as a dual quaternion. Using the framework of stochastic cloning both the rotation and translation measurements are incorporated in a statistically consistent way including a proper treatment of the uncertainties of the previous estimates. An enhanced performance compared to classical dynamical models is obtained for a basic sensor hardware setup and demonstrated for several typical experimental data sets. The described sensor system is completely self-contained and can be used standalone for indoor or combined indoor/outdoor scenarios as well as in hybrid positioning systems.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60102538","afid":"60102538","affilname":"Karlsruher Institut für Technologie","affiliation-city":"Karlsruhe","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025641","afid":"60025641","affilname":"Universität Freiburg","affiliation-city":"Freiburg im Breisgau","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007798","afid":"60007798","affilname":"Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR)","affiliation-city":"Koln","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113098915","afid":"113098915","affilname":"Hahn-Schickard-Gesellschaft Institute of Microsystems and Information Technology (HSG-IMIT)","affiliation-city":"Villingen-Schwenningen","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55605475300","authid":"55605475300","authname":"Schwaab M.","surname":"Schwaab","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113098915"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36716942200","authid":"36716942200","authname":"Romanovas M.","surname":"Romanovas","given-name":"Michailas","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007798"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191611581","authid":"57191611581","authname":"Plaia D.","surname":"Plaia","given-name":"Davide","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113098915"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36731389900","authid":"36731389900","authname":"Schwarze T.","surname":"Schwarze","given-name":"Tobias","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004125957","authid":"7004125957","authname":"Manoli Y.","surname":"Manoli","given-name":"Yiannos","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113098915"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025641"}]}],"article-number":"7527939","source-id":"21100782624","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988517272"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988517272?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84988517272&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84988517272&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988517272","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84988517272","eid":"2-s2.0-84988517272","dc:title":"Direct geolocation of satellite images with the EO-CFI libraries","dc:creator":"De Miguel E.","prism:publicationName":"European Space Agency, (Special Publication) ESA SP","prism:issn":"03796566","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789292213053"}],"prism:volume":"SP-740","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2016-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 August 2016","dc:description":"The INTA Remote Sensing Laboratory has implemented a tool for the direct geolocation of satellite images.

The tool has been already tailored for georeferencing images from the forthcoming Spanish Earth Observation mission SEOS at/Ingenio, and for the camera APIS onboard the INTA cubesat OPTOS. The next step is to configure it for the geolocation of Sentinel 2 L1b images. The tool has been internally validated by different means.

A primary difficulty in applying the Bingham distribution has been the lack of an efficient method for fitting the distribution parameters with respect to the material's underlying crystallographic symmetry or any statistical sample symmetry due to processing. This paper presents a symmetrized distribution, based on the quaternion Bingham, which can account for any general combination of crystallographic or sample symmetries. A numerical scheme is also introduced for estimating the parameters of the symmetrized distribution based on the well known expectation maximization algorithm.This short communication presents a symmetrized Bingham distribution for the modeling of crystallographic texture which can account for arbitrary crystallographic and statistical sample (resulting from material processing) symmetries. Additionally, an efficient computational scheme is presented for parameter estimation.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003500","afid":"60003500","affilname":"The Ohio State University","affiliation-city":"Columbus","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23052031200","authid":"23052031200","authname":"Niezgoda S.R.","surname":"Niezgoda","given-name":"Stephen R.","initials":"S.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003500"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003500"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190524951","authid":"57190524951","authname":"Magnuson E.A.","surname":"Magnuson","given-name":"Eric A.","initials":"E.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003500"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202417761","authid":"7202417761","authname":"Glover J.","surname":"Glover","given-name":"Jared","initials":"J."}],"authkeywords":"Bingham distribution | microtexture | parameter estimation | symmetry | texture","source-id":"24693","fund-acr":"DARPA","fund-no":"D15AP00103","fund-sponsor":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84980383420"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84980383420?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84980383420&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84980383420&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84980383420","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84980383420","eid":"2-s2.0-84980383420","dc:title":"On-ground processing of yaogan-24 remote sensing satellite attitude data and verification using geometric field calibration","dc:creator":"Wang M.","prism:publicationName":"Sensors (Switzerland)","prism:issn":"14248220","prism:volume":"16","prism:issueIdentifier":"8","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2016-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 August 2016","prism:doi":"10.3390/s16081203","dc:description":"Satellite attitude accuracy is an important factor affecting the geometric processing accuracy of high-resolution optical satellite imagery. To address the problem whereby the accuracy of the Yaogan-24 remote sensing satellite’s on-board attitude data processing is not high enough and thus cannot meet its image geometry processing requirements, we developed an approach involving on-ground attitude data processing and digital orthophoto (DOM) and the digital elevation model (DEM) verification of a geometric calibration field. The approach focuses on three modules: on-ground processing based on bidirectional filter, overall weighted smoothing and fitting, and evaluation in the geometric calibration field. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed on-ground processing method is both robust and feasible, which ensures the reliability of the observation data quality, convergence and stability of the parameter estimation model. In addition, both the Euler angle and quaternion could be used to build a mathematical fitting model, while the orthogonal polynomial fitting model is more suitable for modeling the attitude parameter. Furthermore, compared to the image geometric processing results based on on-board attitude data, the image uncontrolled and relative geometric positioning result accuracy can be increased by about 50%.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029306","afid":"60029306","affilname":"Wuhan University","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205635094","authid":"57205635094","authname":"Wang M.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Mi","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029306"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56564608000","authid":"56564608000","authname":"Fan C.","surname":"Fan","given-name":"Chengcheng","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029306"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188670239","authid":"57188670239","authname":"Yang B.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Bo","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029306"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029306"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12781401900","authid":"12781401900","authname":"Jin S.","surname":"Jin","given-name":"Shuying","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029306"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55459046800","authid":"55459046800","authname":"Pan J.","surname":"Pan","given-name":"Jun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029306"}]}],"authkeywords":"Bidirectional filter | Earth observation camera | Gyroscope | Precise attitude estimation | Star sensor | Yaogan-24 remote sensing satellite","article-number":"1203","source-id":"130124","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84978943527"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84978943527?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84978943527&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84978943527&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84978943527","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84978943527","eid":"2-s2.0-84978943527","dc:title":"Sparse representation based on vector extension of reduced quaternion matrix for multiscale image denoising","dc:creator":"Gai S.","prism:publicationName":"IET Image Processing","prism:issn":"17519659","prism:volume":"10","prism:issueIdentifier":"8","prism:pageRange":"598-607","prism:coverDate":"2016-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 August 2016","prism:doi":"10.1049/iet-ipr.2015.0611","dc:description":"Sparse representations of multi-channel signals have drawn considerable interest in recent years.

The present study introduces a novel correlation technique that exploits the crystallographic orientation field as a surface pattern to measure crystal motions. Introducing a quaternion-based formalism reveals crystal symmetry that is very convenient to handle and orientation extraction. Spatial regularization is provided by a penalty to deviation of displacement fields from being the solution to a homogeneous linear elastic problem. This procedure allows the large scale features of the displacement field to be captured, mostly from grain boundaries, and a fair interpolation of the displacement to be obtained within the grains. From these data, crystal rotations can be estimated very accurately. Both synthetic and real experimental cases are considered to illustrate the method.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60277576","afid":"60277576","affilname":"Laboratoire de Mécanique Paris-Saclay","affiliation-city":"Gif-sur-Yvette","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029873","afid":"60029873","affilname":"Electricité de France","affiliation-city":"Paris","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191043449","authid":"57191043449","authname":"Shi Q.","surname":"Shi","given-name":"Qiwei","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60277576"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029873"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24474983400","authid":"24474983400","authname":"Latourte F.","surname":"Latourte","given-name":"Félix","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029873"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006834830","authid":"7006834830","authname":"Hild F.","surname":"Hild","given-name":"François","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60277576"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7103057909","authid":"7103057909","authname":"Roux S.","surname":"Roux","given-name":"Stéphane","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60277576"}]}],"authkeywords":"digital image correlation | displacement | EBSD | regularization | rotation","article-number":"095006","source-id":"15526","fund-acr":"H2020","fund-no":"661913","fund-sponsor":"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84983609902"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84983609902?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84983609902&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84983609902&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84983609902","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84983609902","eid":"2-s2.0-84983609902","dc:title":"Quaternion support vector classifier","dc:creator":"López-González G.","prism:publicationName":"Intelligent Data Analysis","prism:issn":"1088467X","prism:eIssn":"15714128","prism:volume":"20","prism:issueIdentifier":"s1","prism:pageRange":"S109-S119","prism:coverDate":"2016-07-13","prism:coverDisplayDate":"13 July 2016","prism:doi":"10.3233/IDA-160849","dc:description":"This paper is concerned with the Quaternion Support Vector Machines for classification as a generalization of the real- and complex-valued Support Vector Machines.

Therefore, modern flight management systems are reliant on multiple redundant sensors to monitor and control the rotations of the aircraft. To this end, a novel distributed quaternion Kalman filtering algorithm is developed for tracking the rotation and orientation of an aircraft in the three-dimensional space. The algorithm is developed so as to distribute computation among the sensors in a manner that forces them to consent to a unique solution while being robust to sensor and link failure, a desirable characteristic for flight management systems. In addition, the underlying quaternion-valued state space model allows to avoid problems associated with gimbal lock. The performance of the developed algorithm is verified through simulations.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015150","afid":"60015150","affilname":"Imperial College London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56297174200","authid":"56297174200","authname":"Talebi S.P.","surname":"Talebi","given-name":"Sayed Pouria","initials":"S.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56135784800","authid":"56135784800","authname":"Kanna S.","surname":"Kanna","given-name":"Sithan","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25958477900","authid":"25958477900","authname":"Xia Y.","surname":"Xia","given-name":"Yili","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006513328","authid":"7006513328","authname":"Mandic D.P.","surname":"Mandic","given-name":"Danilo P.","initials":"D.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]}],"authkeywords":"distributed adaptive filtering | fly-by-wire | Quaternion-valued adaptive signal processing | quaternion-valued state space modeling","article-number":"7868509","source-id":"21100933017","fund-acr":"EPSRC","fund-no":"EP/H026266/1","fund-sponsor":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85015164267"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85015164267?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85015164267&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85015164267&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85015164267","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85015164267","eid":"2-s2.0-85015164267","dc:title":"Hyperspectral fluorescence data fusion using quaternion and octonion phase","dc:creator":"Bauer S.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781467397087"}],"prism:volume":"0","prism:pageRange":"615-621","prism:coverDate":"2016-07-02","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2 July 2016","prism:doi":"10.1109/MFI.2016.7849555","dc:description":"While common hyperspectral images comprise two spatial and one spectral dimension, hyperspectral fluorescence images can have the excitation wavelength as an additional fourth dimension. We consider hyperspectral fluorescence spectra of minerals for which the emitted fluorescence spectra vary with the irradiated excitation wavelength. In comparison with reflectance spectra, the fluorescence spectra at a fixed excitation wavelength exhibit far less characteristic details and are rather flat. Using these spectra for object classification leads to low classification rates. For this reason, the data contained in the fourth dimension (excitation wavelength) is fused to obtain more characteristic spectra. In this contribution, we will use quaternions and octonions for the fusion: By considering their phase, the information contained in the fourth dimension is compressed and a three-dimensional image containing 'pseudo spectra' in the original spectral dimension is derived. Doing so results in more discriminative spectra that allow for a more robust classification. We will demonstrate the benefit of the proposed method applied to a hyperspectral fluorescence dataset of mineral samples.

The accelerometer and gyroscope inertia measurement unit helped estimate human arm's joint angles in stress test conditions. Four inertia measurement units were mounted on the following human arm parts: humerus, ulna, hand and finger. The estimation of human arm unfolding was done on a plane perpendicular to the earth by using free fall decomposition based on quaternions model. In dynamic environment accelerometer axis signals contain noise usually higher than base signal in addition to gravitational component. Coming from the approach of Maximum relative Entropy we construct posterior distribution based on Bayes Theorem. The likelihood distribution includes both observed values and nonlinear model relationships. In comparison, the prediction stage of Kalman Filter contains the model translation. Whereas the main difference is that we use multiple most recent observed samples instead of recursive approach. This allowed to stably decompose gravitational acceleration vector from measurement data. High speed data filtering performs Bayesian updating and finds the mean of posterior probability density function derived from maximization of relative entropy. This enables the control of remote robotic arm in harsh environments where shocks and vibrations exist. We experimented with this robotic system and demonstrated expected behavior of the manipulator when artificial shocks and vibrations were applied.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60042282","afid":"60042282","affilname":"Kaunas University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Kaunas","affiliation-country":"Lithuania"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57215320307","authid":"57215320307","authname":"Root K.","surname":"Root","given-name":"Karolis","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60042282"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/37089751700","authid":"37089751700","authname":"Urniezius R.","surname":"Urniezius","given-name":"Renaldas","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60042282"}]}],"article-number":"7849513","source-id":"94992","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85011805581"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85011805581?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85011805581&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85011805581&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85011805581","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85011805581","eid":"2-s2.0-85011805581","dc:title":"Remarks on Hypercomplex-Valued Neural Network-Based Direct Adaptive Controller","dc:creator":"Takahashi K.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - 2016 International Conference on Multimedia Systems and Signal Processing, ICMSSP 2016","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781509045198"}],"prism:pageRange":"85-89","prism:coverDate":"2016-07-02","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2 July 2016","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICMSSP.2016.027","dc:description":"In this study, we investigate the control performance of an adaptive controller using multilayer hypercomplex-valued neural networks, such as complex, hyperbolic, bicomplex and quaternion neural networks.

Experimental results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed controller.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010726","afid":"60010726","affilname":"Doshisha University","affiliation-city":"Kyoto","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7409417392","authid":"7409417392","authname":"Takahashi K.","surname":"Takahashi","given-name":"Kazuhiko","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010726"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193225311","authid":"57193225311","authname":"Wakaume Y.","surname":"Wakaume","given-name":"Yuka","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010726"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194786271","authid":"57194786271","authname":"Hirayama T.","surname":"Hirayama","given-name":"Takahiro","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010726"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211218398","authid":"57211218398","authname":"Hashimoto M.","surname":"Hashimoto","given-name":"Masafumi","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010726"}]}],"authkeywords":"adaptive control | hypercomplex number | neural network | nonlinear system","article-number":"7946042","source-id":"21100962727","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
