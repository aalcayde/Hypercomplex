Multi-dimensional signals exhibit a complex nonlinear relationship and couple among different components. Considering that quaternion has huge advantage in terms of the representation of 3D and 4D signal, quaternion algebra is employed to derive the quaternion least mean square (QLMS) algorithm for hypercomplex signal processes. However, QLMS originates from the least mean square (LMS) algorithm, which may result in performance degradation when the signal is non-Gaussian. Due to the desirable performance of the least mean kurtosis (LMK) algorithm in non-Gaussian situation, in the present work we extend the original LMK algorithm to quaternion domain to manage the 3D and 4D signal processes. The analysis shows that QLMK provides a solution that is responsive to dynamically changing environments. Simulations on prediction of 4D Saito's chaotic circuit and 3D Lorenz attractor confirm the desirable performance of the proposed method.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026981","afid":"60026981","affilname":"Xi'an University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018308","afid":"60018308","affilname":"Xi'an Jiaotong University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016835","afid":"60016835","affilname":"Beijing Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56225950700","authid":"56225950700","authname":"Chen T.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Tao","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018308"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16177239100","authid":"16177239100","authname":"Chen B.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Badong","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018308"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55617149400","authid":"55617149400","authname":"Ma W.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Wentao","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026981"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55492932100","authid":"55492932100","authname":"Sun L.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Lei","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive filtering | prediction | quaternion | signal processing","article-number":"8009739","source-id":"21100830468","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61372152","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85030214386"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85030214386?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85030214386&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85030214386&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85030214386","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85030214386","eid":"2-s2.0-85030214386","dc:title":"Proceedings of 8th International Conference on Recent Advances in Space Technologies, RAST 2017","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of 8th International Conference on Recent Advances in Space Technologies, RAST 2017","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781538616031"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2017-08-04","prism:coverDisplayDate":"4 August 2017","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 93 papers.

Currently, many image enhancement methods are capable of enhancing the details of the color image. However, these methods only process the red, green and blue (RGB) color channels separately, which leads to color distortion easily. In order to overcome this problem, the paper presents an approach to integrate the quaternion theory into the traditional guided filter to obtain a quaternion guided filter (QGF). This method makes full use of the color information of an image to realize the holistic processing of RGB color channels. So as to preserve color information while enhancing details, this paper proposes a color image detail enhancement algorithm based on the QGF. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is effective in the applications of the color image detail enhancement, and enables image's edges to be more prominent and texture clearer while avoiding color distortion. Compared with the existing image enhancement methods, the proposed method achieves better enhancement performance in terms of the visual quality and the objective evaluating indicators.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027363","afid":"60027363","affilname":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60004828","afid":"60004828","affilname":"Changchun Institute of Optics Fine Mechanics and Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57198359368","authid":"57198359368","authname":"Kun W.","surname":"Kun","given-name":"Wu","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027363"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57509827100","authid":"57509827100","authname":"Guiju L.","surname":"Guiju","given-name":"Li","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/22734448900","authid":"22734448900","authname":"Guangliang H.","surname":"Guangliang","given-name":"Han","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57198347178","authid":"57198347178","authname":"Hang Y.","surname":"Hang","given-name":"Yang","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57198352098","authid":"57198352098","authname":"Peixun L.","surname":"Peixun","given-name":"Liu","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60004828"}]}],"authkeywords":"detail enhancement | quaternion guided filter | self-adaptive enhancement transform","source-id":"4700153604","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61401425","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85029186863"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85029186863?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85029186863&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85029186863&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85029186863","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85029186863","eid":"2-s2.0-85029186863","dc:title":"Quaternion Common Spatial Patterns","dc:creator":"Enshaeifar S.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","prism:issn":"15344320","prism:volume":"25","prism:issueIdentifier":"8","prism:pageRange":"1278-1286","prism:coverDate":"2017-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"August 2017","prism:doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2016.2625039","dc:description":"A novel quaternion-valued common spatial patterns (QCSP) algorithm is introduced to model co-channel coupling of multi-dimensional processes.

The proposed algorithm divides the steering vector into three parts, and estimates each part separately, thus DOA and polarization parameters can be estimated only by N times one-dimensional spectral peak search, where N denotes the sources number.

Finally, simulation examples demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025578","afid":"60025578","affilname":"Xidian University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56729271200","authid":"56729271200","authname":"Zhao J.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Jichao","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202328081","authid":"7202328081","authname":"Tao H.","surname":"Tao","given-name":"Haihong","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"}]}],"authkeywords":"dimension reduction quaternion MUSIC (DRQMUSIC) | direction of arrival (DOA) | polarization","source-id":"26195","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85018771027"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85018771027?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85018771027&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85018771027&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85018771027","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85018771027","eid":"2-s2.0-85018771027","dc:title":"Attitude algorithm and initial alignment method for SINS applied in short-range aircraft","dc:creator":"Zhang R.H.","prism:publicationName":"Modern Physics Letters B","prism:issn":"02179849","prism:volume":"31","prism:issueIdentifier":"19-21","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2017-07-30","prism:coverDisplayDate":"30 July 2017","prism:doi":"10.1142/S0217984917400814","dc:description":"This paper presents an attitude solution algorithm based on the Micro-Electro-Mechanical System and quaternion method.

Despite the pivotal role of this motion, it has received relatively few formal investigations in regards to real-time data measurement due to the limitations in image acquisition speeds. This study used inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors to examine the ranges of flexion-extension and radial-ulnar deviation movements measured in anatomical plane and oblique plane. The trials involved 15 healthy subjects and 8 patients having four-corner fusion and radioscapholunate fusion. The results from the experiments demonstrated a significant difference between the range of flexion-extension motion in the anatomical plane and in the oblique plane while the results did not imply the same conclusion for the radial-ulnar deviation range. Thus, our findings emphasized the importance of using dart-thrower's motion to examine the functionality of the wrist rather than basic motions in the anatomical plane.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021050","afid":"60021050","affilname":"Barwon Health","affiliation-city":"Geelong","affiliation-country":"Australia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018805","afid":"60018805","affilname":"Deakin University","affiliation-city":"Geelong","affiliation-country":"Australia"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189329604","authid":"57189329604","authname":"Nguyen N.","surname":"Nguyen","given-name":"Nhan","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018805"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56647566700","authid":"56647566700","authname":"Pham T.","surname":"Pham","given-name":"Trieu","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018805"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195514342","authid":"57195514342","authname":"Mahani T.","surname":"Mahani","given-name":"Tarun","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018805"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35587472100","authid":"35587472100","authname":"Pathirana P.N.","surname":"Pathirana","given-name":"Pubudu N.","initials":"P.N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018805"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35188652700","authid":"35188652700","authname":"Babazadeh S.","surname":"Babazadeh","given-name":"Sina","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021050"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195512937","authid":"57195512937","authname":"Ling F.","surname":"Ling","given-name":"Ferraby","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021050"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402109999","authid":"7402109999","authname":"Page R.","surname":"Page","given-name":"Richard","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021050"}]}],"authkeywords":"Dart-thrower's motion | Inertial measurement unit | Quaternion | Ranges of motions of the wrist joint | Real-time human motion capturing | Wrist kinematic coupling motion","article-number":"7993486","source-id":"21100828705","fund-acr":"NICTA","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"National ICT Australia","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027858750"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027858750?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85027858750&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85027858750&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027858750","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85027858750","eid":"2-s2.0-85027858750","dc:title":"High-precision attitude estimation method of star sensors and gyro based on complementary filter and unscented kalman filter","dc:creator":"Guo C.","prism:publicationName":"International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives","prism:issn":"16821750","prism:volume":"42","prism:issueIdentifier":"3W1","prism:pageRange":"49-53","prism:coverDate":"2017-07-25","prism:coverDisplayDate":"25 July 2017","prism:doi":"10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-3-W1-49-2017","dc:description":"Determining the attitude of satellite at the time of imaging then establishing the mathematical relationship between image points and ground points is essential in high-resolution remote sensing image mapping. Star tracker is insensitive to the high frequency attitude variation due to the measure noise and satellite jitter, but the low frequency attitude motion can be determined with high accuracy. Gyro, as a short-term reference to the satellite's attitude, is sensitive to high frequency attitude change, but due to the existence of gyro drift and integral error, the attitude determination error increases with time. Based on the opposite noise frequency characteristics of two kinds of attitude sensors, this paper proposes an on-orbit attitude estimation method of star sensors and gyro based on Complementary Filter (CF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). In this study, the principle and implementation of the proposed method are described. First, gyro attitude quaternions are acquired based on the attitude kinematics equation. An attitude information fusion method is then introduced, which applies high-pass filtering and low-pass filtering to the gyro and star tracker, respectively. Second, the attitude fusion data based on CF are introduced as the observed values of UKF system in the process of measurement updating. The accuracy and effectiveness of the method are validated based on the simulated sensors attitude data. The obtained results indicate that the proposed method can suppress the gyro drift and measure noise of attitude sensors, improving the accuracy of the attitude determination significantly, comparing with the simulated on-orbit attitude and the attitude estimation results of the UKF defined by the same simulation parameters.","citedby-count":"13","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073652","afid":"60073652","affilname":"Tongji University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100335817","afid":"100335817","affilname":"China International Engineering Consulting Corporation","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "8", "$" :"8"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188987354","authid":"57188987354","authname":"Guo C.","surname":"Guo","given-name":"Chengcheng","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073652"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55500134600","authid":"55500134600","authname":"Tong X.","surname":"Tong","given-name":"Xiaohua","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073652"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55724717800","authid":"55724717800","authname":"Liu S.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Shijie","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073652"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/38662862600","authid":"38662862600","authname":"Liu S.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Sicong","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073652"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195409059","authid":"57195409059","authname":"Lu X.","surname":"Lu","given-name":"Xiaojun","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"100335817"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56881783400","authid":"56881783400","authname":"Chen P.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Peng","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073652"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57213001021","authid":"57213001021","authname":"Jin Y.","surname":"Jin","given-name":"Yanming","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073652"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "8", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36117406500","authid":"36117406500","authname":"Xie H.","surname":"Xie","given-name":"Huan","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073652"}]}],"authkeywords":"Attitude accuracy | Complementary filter | Gyro | Star tracker | Unscented Kalman filter","source-id":"21100248929","fund-no":"41325005","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85025427152"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85025427152?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85025427152&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85025427152&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85025427152","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85025427152","eid":"2-s2.0-85025427152","dc:title":"Copyright protection for elemental image array by hypercomplex Fourier transform and an adaptive texturized holographic algorithm","dc:creator":"Li X.W.","prism:publicationName":"Optics Express","prism:eIssn":"10944087","prism:volume":"25","prism:issueIdentifier":"15","prism:pageRange":"17076-17098","prism:coverDate":"2017-07-24","prism:coverDisplayDate":"24 July 2017","prism:doi":"10.1364/OE.25.017076","dc:description":"In practical applications of three-dimensional integral imaging, the captured elemental image array (EIA) needs to be stored and delivered through the Internet. Therefore, there is an urgent need for protecting the copyright of EIA against piracy and malicious manipulation. In our work, we propose a copyright protection algorithm for EIA by combining the use of the modified hypercomplex Fourier transform (HFT) and the adaptive texturized holographic algorithm. The modified HFT can accurately extract the features from each elemental image. According to these features, we embed watermark into the visually less noticeable regions of the EIA to increase the visual perception. In addition, an adaptive texturized holographic algorithm is proposed to increase the robustness. Finally, the analytical performances are contrasted with simulation results where the imperceptibility and robustness of the proposed method are evaluated against standard attacks.","citedby-count":"14","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016521","afid":"60016521","affilname":"Sichuan University","affiliation-city":"Chengdu","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011883","afid":"60011883","affilname":"Pukyong National University","affiliation-city":"Busan","affiliation-country":"South Korea"}],"pubmed-id":"28789204","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57556299700","authid":"57556299700","authname":"Li X.W.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Xiao Wei","initials":"X.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016521"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/50161654900","authid":"50161654900","authname":"Kim S.T.","surname":"Kim","given-name":"Seok Tae","initials":"S.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011883"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/22936217300","authid":"22936217300","authname":"Wang Q.H.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Qiong Hua","initials":"Q.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016521"}]}],"source-id":"12862","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"JZX2016-0606/Y267","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85037352178"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85037352178?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85037352178&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85037352178&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85037352178","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85037352178","eid":"2-s2.0-85037352178","dc:title":"A new method for compressed sensing color images reconstruction based on total variation model","dc:creator":"Liao F.","prism:publicationName":"ACM International Conference Proceeding Series","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781450352871"}],"prism:volume":"Part F131840","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2017-07-17","prism:coverDisplayDate":"17 July 2017","prism:doi":"10.1145/3144789.3144810","dc:description":"A new method based on the total variation model, applicable to reconstruct the compressed sensing color images, is proposed.

The solar vector measuring device comprises the transparent shell, the photocell array, the real-time clock and the controller. When the sun shines through the transparent shell illuminates the photocell array, the photocell array can convert the solar energy into the electric potential signal. According to the size of the solar energy and the angle of the photocell laying, combining with the accurate time provided by the real time clock, the solar vector of this time is obtained through the main controller processes data.

Considering the influences brought by the nonlinear dynamics and external disturbances, the above nonlinear model is simplified to be a new convex hull linear model. Then, an observer based convex hull robust filter is further constructed to generate the desired residual signal, and significant existence conditions of the desired filter can be solved by the LMI convex optimization method, where the system's stability and robust performance can be guaranteed.

Taking into account the array output vector and its three involutions simultaneously, a quaternion-valued augmented signal model is established to exploit the noncircular information of the desired signal. The involution augmented adaptive beamforming is finally fulfilled based on the quaternion-valued widely linear processing. Compared with the conventional quaternion beamformers, the proposed beamformer has an improved reception capability for noncircular signals. The aperture of the array is extended and hence the degree-of-freedom of interference suppression is increased via widely linear processing.

Recently quaternions or Clifford algebras have been used to perform color image processing. This paper uses the embedding of color information into the imaginary part of a Quaternion. From this coding strategy, discrete Hypercomplex 2D polynomial transform is presented as generalizing the real polynomial transform to the Hypercomplex domain. We illustrate how this numerical approach can be used to define Wavelet filter bank transform for color image, with piecewise Hypercomplex polynomial. From this, the connection between discrete polynomial representation and multiscale, filter bank algorithm already defined for Grayscale image is described and the proposed color representation is discussed. This new hypercomplex polynomial-wavelet transform has an extra parameter: an imaginary unit quaternion corresponding to a privileged color direction. This new color representation satisfies the conditions of orthogonality, perfect reconstruction and linear phase filter. Moreover, a link between hypercomplex polynomial projections and discrete multiscale differentiators is studied. We also give a practical study of this new Hypercomplex transform in the contexts of image denoising, which validates the interest of our construction.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032653","afid":"60032653","affilname":"Universite de Poitiers","affiliation-city":"Poitiers","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005276736","authid":"7005276736","authname":"Augereau B.","surname":"Augereau","given-name":"Bertrand","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032653"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36008284700","authid":"36008284700","authname":"Carré P.","surname":"Carré","given-name":"Philippe","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032653"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image | Filter bank | Polynomial transform | Quaternion | Wavelet","source-id":"25548","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028258557"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028258557?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85028258557&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85028258557&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0165168416303255"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028258557","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85028258557","eid":"2-s2.0-85028258557","dc:title":"Characterisation and extraction of a Rayleigh-wave mode in vertically heterogeneous media using quaternion SVD","dc:creator":"Sajeva A.","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing","prism:issn":"01651684","prism:volume":"136","prism:pageRange":"43-58","prism:coverDate":"2017-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 July 2017","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.sigpro.2016.11.011","pii":"S0165168416303255","dc:description":"We propose a method that identifies a mode of Rayleigh waves and separates it from body waves and from other modes, using quaternions to represent multi-component data.

Our method decomposes the signal into narrow-frequency bands, which undergo both a velocity correction and a polarisation correction. The aim of these corrections is to reduce the mode of interest to a quasi-monochromatic wave packet with infinite apparent velocity and quasi-circular polarisation. Once written in quaternion notation, we refer to this wave packet as “quaternion brick”. Based on theoretical considerations, we prove that this quaternion brick maps into the first quaternion eigenimage of the quaternion singular value decomposition. We apply this method to synthetic datasets derived from two vertically heterogeneous models to extract the fundamental mode and we prove that it is correctly separated from either a higher mode of propagation or body waves with negligible residual. Results are presented in both time–offset and frequency–phase slowness domains.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028868","afid":"60028868","affilname":"Università di Pisa","affiliation-city":"Pisa","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35235033000","authid":"35235033000","authname":"Sajeva A.","surname":"Sajeva","given-name":"Angelo","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028868"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35520110300","authid":"35520110300","authname":"Menanno G.","surname":"Menanno","given-name":"Giovanni","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028868"}]}],"authkeywords":"Multi-component arrays | Quaternion SVD | Rayleigh waves | Seismic | Wavefield separation","source-id":"25548","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028247664"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028247664?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85028247664&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85028247664&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0165168416302730"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028247664","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85028247664","eid":"2-s2.0-85028247664","dc:title":"Cost-effective quaternion minimum mean square error estimation: From widely linear to four-channel processing","dc:creator":"Xiang M.","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing","prism:issn":"01651684","prism:volume":"136","prism:pageRange":"81-91","prism:coverDate":"2017-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 July 2017","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.sigpro.2016.10.007","pii":"S0165168416302730","dc:description":"Widely linear estimation plays an important role in quaternion signal processing, as it caters for both proper and improper quaternion signals. However, widely linear algorithms are computationally expensive owing to the use of augmented variables and statistics. To reduce the computation cost while maintaining the performance level, we propose a four-channel estimation framework as an efficient alternative to quaternion widely linear estimation. This is achieved by using four linear models to estimate the four components of quaternion signals. We also show that any of the four channels is able to replace a strictly linear quaternion estimator when estimating strictly linear systems. The proposed method is shown to reduce computational complexity and provide more flexible algorithms, while preserving the physical meaning inherent in the quaternion domain. The proposed framework is next applied to quaternion minimum mean square error estimation to yield the reduced-complexity versions of the quaternion least mean square (QLMS), quaternion recursive least squares (QRLS), and quaternion nonlinear gradient decent (QNGD) algorithms. For the proposed QLMS algorithm, an adaptive step-size strategy is also explored. The effectiveness of the so introduced estimation techniques is validated by simulations on synthetic and real-world signals.","citedby-count":"17","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021097","afid":"60021097","affilname":"University of Surrey","affiliation-city":"Guildford","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015150","afid":"60015150","affilname":"Imperial College London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189332044","authid":"57189332044","authname":"Xiang M.","surname":"Xiang","given-name":"Min","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56614550100","authid":"56614550100","authname":"Cheong Took C.","surname":"Cheong Took","given-name":"Clive","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021097"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006513328","authid":"7006513328","authname":"Mandic D.P.","surname":"Mandic","given-name":"Danilo P.","initials":"D.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]}],"authkeywords":"Computational complexity | Four-channel model | Mean square error | Quaternion filter | Widely linear estimation","source-id":"25548","fund-acr":"EPSRC","fund-no":"EP/H026266/1","fund-sponsor":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028245547"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028245547?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85028245547&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85028245547&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S016516841630322X"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028245547","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85028245547","eid":"2-s2.0-85028245547","dc:title":"Feed forward neural network with random quaternionic neurons","dc:creator":"Minemoto T.","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing","prism:issn":"01651684","prism:volume":"136","prism:pageRange":"59-68","prism:coverDate":"2017-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 July 2017","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.sigpro.2016.11.008","pii":"S016516841630322X","dc:description":"A quaternionic extension of feed forward neural network, for processing multi-dimensional signals, is proposed in this paper.

systems with intermittent observations by using a widely linear processing. The uncertainty of the observations is modeled by a Bernoulli distributed quaternion variable with known parameters. An augmented linear state–space model is developed to describe the evolution of both the quaternion state and their noisy observations. On the basis of that model, the optimal widely linear filter, predictor and smoothers (fixed-point and fixed-interval), that only depend on probabilities, are obtained via an innovation analysis approach. The special case of semi-widely linear estimators, which appears under Cη-properness, is also studied. Simulation examples demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed estimators.","citedby-count":"15","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014586","afid":"60014586","affilname":"Universidad de Jaén","affiliation-city":"Jaen","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56589183200","authid":"56589183200","authname":"Jiménez-López J.D.","surname":"Jiménez-López","given-name":"José Domingo","initials":"J.D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014586"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6506232550","authid":"6506232550","authname":"Fernández-Alcalá R.M.","surname":"Fernández-Alcalá","given-name":"Rosa María","initials":"R.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014586"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602299200","authid":"6602299200","authname":"Navarro-Moreno J.","surname":"Navarro-Moreno","given-name":"Jesús","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014586"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701415559","authid":"6701415559","authname":"Ruiz-Molina J.C.","surname":"Ruiz-Molina","given-name":"Juan Carlos","initials":"J.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014586"}]}],"authkeywords":"Cη-properness | Filtering | Intermittent observations | Prediction and smoothing problems | Quaternion signals | Widely linear processing","source-id":"25548","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027958171"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027958171?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85027958171&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85027958171&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0165168416303358"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027958171","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85027958171","eid":"2-s2.0-85027958171","dc:title":"Octonion Fourier Transform of real-valued functions of three variables - selected properties and examples","dc:creator":"Błaszczyk Ł.","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing","prism:issn":"01651684","prism:volume":"136","prism:pageRange":"29-37","prism:coverDate":"2017-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 July 2017","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.sigpro.2016.11.021","pii":"S0165168416303358","dc:description":"The paper is devoted to properties of the Octonion Fourier Transform (OFT) defined in 2011 by Hahn and Snopek, i.e. symmetry properties, Parseval-Plancherel and Wiener-Khintchine Theorems. This work has been inspired by the Hermitian symmetry of the Complex Fourier Transform and known symmetry relations of the Quaternion Fourier Transform that were defined by Bülow. Similar symmetry relations for the OFT are derived using the notion of octonion involutions. The proof of the corresponding theorem is presented and the result is illustrated with multiple examples. Also the octonion analogues of Parseval and Plancherel Theorems are derived. Those results, along with the shift property of OFT, lead to the proof of the octonion version of Wiener-Khintchine Theorem and the octonion definitions of autocorrelation function and power spectral density of a signal.","citedby-count":"24","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60013756","afid":"60013756","affilname":"University of Warsaw","affiliation-city":"Warsaw","affiliation-country":"Poland"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003675","afid":"60003675","affilname":"Politechnika Warszawska","affiliation-city":"Warsaw","affiliation-country":"Poland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56007862100","authid":"56007862100","authname":"Błaszczyk Ł.","surname":"Błaszczyk","given-name":"Łukasz","initials":"Ł.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60013756"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003675"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56071249400","authid":"56071249400","authname":"Snopek K.M.","surname":"Snopek","given-name":"Kajetana M.","initials":"K.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003675"}]}],"authkeywords":"Hermitian symmetry | Octonion Fourier Transform | Octonions | Parseval-Plancherel Theorems | Wiener-Khintchine Theorem","source-id":"25548","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027705357"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027705357?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85027705357&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85027705357&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027705357","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85027705357","eid":"2-s2.0-85027705357","dc:title":"Image fusion scheme based on quaternion wavelet transform and sparse representation","dc:creator":"Chang L.","prism:publicationName":"Xi Tong Gong Cheng Yu Dian Zi Ji Shu/Systems Engineering and Electronics","prism:issn":"1001506X","prism:volume":"39","prism:issueIdentifier":"7","prism:pageRange":"1633-1639","prism:coverDate":"2017-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 July 2017","prism:doi":"10.3969/j.issn.1001-506X.2017.07.29","dc:description":"A novel image fusion scheme based on quaternion wavelet transform and sparse representation (QWTS) is proposed. This method complements the defects existing in traditional multi-scale analysis based image fusion and sparse representation based image fusion. The proposed QWTS based image fusion scheme performs the three stages. Firstly, the quaternion wavelet multiscale decomposition of each source image is performed to obtain their low-pass and high-pass coefficients.Secondly, the fused quaternion wavelet coefficients are obtained in the low-pass bands with a sparse representation based fusion approach while in the high-pass bands by fusing the largest absolution values. Thirdly, the fused image is reconstructed by taking inverse quaternion wavelet transform. Furthermore, the proposed image fusion scheme is analyzed theoretically. The performance of the proposed image fusion scheme is evaluated on six groups testing images, and the fused results is compared with those results obtained by the sparse representation, the discrete wavelet transform, the dual-tree complex wavelet transform and the quaternion wavelet transform image fusion schemes subjectively and objectively. Experimental results show that the proposed fusion scheme is very effective.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073423","afid":"60073423","affilname":"Baoji University of Arts and Sciences","affiliation-city":"Baoji","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025578","afid":"60025578","affilname":"Xidian University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55891753000","authid":"55891753000","authname":"Chang L.","surname":"Chang","given-name":"Lihong","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073423"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403047090","authid":"7403047090","authname":"Feng X.","surname":"Feng","given-name":"Xiangchu","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57258861600","authid":"57258861600","authname":"Zhang R.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Rui","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073423"}]}],"authkeywords":"Image fusion | Multi-scale transform | Quaternion wavelet | Sparse representation","source-id":"15141","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
