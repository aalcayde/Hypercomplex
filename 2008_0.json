In contrast to other visual servoing system in the literature, the one presented here, which was derived from [4], uses a quaternion representation of the rotation instead of the more common matrix representation. By doing so, the proposed system avoids potential singularities introduced by the rotational matrix representation. After performing exhaustive tests in a simulated environment, our controller was applied to a Kawasaki UX150. In the case of simulation, the movement of the camera and the image processing were performed using Matlab-Simulink, which allowed us to test the controller regardeless of the mechanism in which the camera was moved and the underlying controller that was needed for this movement. In the case of the real robot, the controller was tested initially using another simulation program provided by Kawasaki Japan and later with the real Kawasaki robot.

The aim of this paper is to present the notion of kinematic convexity as a key element for a new framework for spherical kinematic geometry that allows for the development of more elegant and efficient algorithms for geometric computations in kinematic applications. The resulting framework, called computational spherical kinematic geometry, is developed by combining the oriented projective geometry with the kinematic geometry of spherical motions. By extending the idea of convexity in affine geometry to an oriented image space of spherical displacements, the notion of kinematic convexity is proposed.

It relies on the knowledge of the variances in the measurement and process noises and is therefore prone to divergence due to modeling errors. The algorithm presented here is an adaptive Optimal-REQUEST procedure, based on the idea of covariance matching, which adjusts the noise variances in the filter in an on-line and optimal manner. For this purpose, non-classical residuals are designed by exploiting the structure of the so-called if-matrix and their statistical properties are investigated. As a result, although processing the same vector observation, two distinct algorithms can be developed for measurement noise adaptive filtering and for process noise adaptive filtering. The special case of zero-mean white measurement and process noises is considered. A simulation study is used to demonstrate the performance of the various adaptive algorithms. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations show that the process noise adaptive procedure can compensate for large unknown biases in the process noise.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027161","afid":"60027161","affilname":"Ben-Gurion University of the Negev","affiliation-city":"Beer Sheva","affiliation-country":"Israel"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12778249200","authid":"12778249200","authname":"Choukroun D.","surname":"Choukroun","given-name":"Daniel","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027161"}]}],"source-id":"21100217010","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84863768460"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84863768460?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84863768460&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84863768460&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84863768460","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84863768460","eid":"2-s2.0-84863768460","dc:title":"The ℍ-analytic signal","dc:creator":"Le Bihan N.","prism:publicationName":"European Signal Processing Conference","prism:issn":"22195491","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2008-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2008","dc:description":"We consider the extension of the analytic signal concept known for real valued signals to the case of complex signals.

The best benefit of dual-quaternion is that it is able to handle rotation and translation simultaneously and apply continuous product of dual quaternion operating with a kind of special vector dual vector to express a serious of rotation and translation. We find that dual quaternion has special relationship in 3-D transformation and 2-D image plane, and use this relationship to estimate object s transformation from 2-D observing image. Because of the benefit of dual quaternion easily to handle and express a serious of transformation, we make above estimation more practically and reality using dual-quaternion. At last, we design a simulation to prove our method has better practicality and is more convenient to estimate 3-D transformation.

This reference frame transformation problem has, however, never been considered for velocity signals. Therefore we asked whether a separate 3D visuomotor transformation of velocity signals was theoretically required by modeling the underlying geometry. We used quaternions to model the 3D eye-in-head geometry. Our model predicted that a visuomotor velocity transformation would require extra-retinal 3D eye-in-head position to convert the retinal velocity input into spatially accurate behavior and includes three different components; (1) the same retinal velocity results in different eye rotation axes depending on eyein-head position, (2) false torsion due to off-axes eye positions must be compensated for and (3) ocular torsion (e.g. due to the VOR) must be accounted for. To test these predictions, subjects were required either to pursue a moving target viewed under different vertical (prediction 1) or oblique (prediction 2) eye positions, or viewed under different head roll angles generating VOR-induced eye torsion (prediction 3). We measured 3D eye and head orientation and analyzed the openloop gaze pursuit response, i.e. the first 100ms after pursuit onset. We then compared the observed pursuit response to the predictions of the model: if no transformation was performed, pursuit direction should best correlate with the retinal target movement direction; a complete 3D velocity transformation would be reflected in spatially accurate pursuit. We found that for all 3 predictions, the direction of pursuit initiation was spatially accurate and did not follow the retinal (no transformation) hypothesis. This suggests that the brain performs a complete 3D visuomotor velocity transformation for smooth pursuit eye movements that is different from the previously described visuomotor transformation of position signals for saccades. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60086834","afid":"60086834","affilname":"Queen's University, Centre for Neuroscience Studies, Kingston","affiliation-city":"Kingston","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000874","afid":"60000874","affilname":"Université Catholique de Louvain","affiliation-city":"Louvain-la-Neuve","affiliation-country":"Belgium"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603426101","authid":"6603426101","authname":"Blohm G.","surname":"Blohm","given-name":"Gunnar","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000874"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60086834"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35181075600","authid":"35181075600","authname":"Daye P.","surname":"Daye","given-name":"P.","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000874"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35563872600","authid":"35563872600","authname":"Lefevre P.","surname":"Lefevre","given-name":"P.","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000874"}]}],"authkeywords":"Geometry | Reference frames | Retinal slip | Smooth pursuit | Visuomotor transformation","source-id":"19400157277","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70349370714"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70349370714?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=70349370714&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=70349370714&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70349370714","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:70349370714","eid":"2-s2.0-70349370714","dc:title":"Quaternion colour representations and derived total orderings for morphological operators","dc:creator":"Angulo J.","prism:publicationName":"Society for Imaging Science and Technology - 4th European Conference on Colour in Graphics, Imaging, and Vision and 10th International Symposium on Multispectral Colour Science, CGIV 2008/MCS'08","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781605607023"}],"prism:pageRange":"417-422","prism:coverDate":"2008-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2008","dc:description":"The definition of morphological operators for colour images needs a total ordering between the colour points.

Based on that the magnitude and phase of the transfer function of the THz-TDS system are primarily governed by the material's intrinsic complex refractive index and its thickness, two functions are given to construct hyper-complex numbers in Clifford Algebra, and then several properties of data distributions in the THz-TDS signal vector space are discussed with Clifford Algebra analysis. Finally, experiments are given to show the potential of the proposed method.© 2008 IEEE.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025578","afid":"60025578","affilname":"Xidian University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000937","afid":"60000937","affilname":"Shenzhen University","affiliation-city":"Shenzhen","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401940431","authid":"7401940431","authname":"Xie W.","surname":"Xie","given-name":"Weixin","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000937"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57276245000","authid":"57276245000","authname":"Li J.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Jing","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000937"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7103298591","authid":"7103298591","authname":"Pei J.","surname":"Pei","given-name":"Jihong","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000937"}]}],"authkeywords":"Clifford Algebra | Hyper-complex number | THz-TDS","article-number":"4697086","source-id":"120046","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/67249090439"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/67249090439?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=67249090439&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=67249090439&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/67249090439","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:67249090439","eid":"2-s2.0-67249090439","dc:title":"Wavelet decomposition 4-feature parallel fusion by quaternion euclidean product distance matching score for palmprint verification","dc:creator":"Liu D.","prism:publicationName":"International Conference on Signal Processing Proceedings, ICSP","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781424421794"}],"prism:pageRange":"2104-2107","prism:coverDate":"2008-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2008","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICOSP.2008.4697560","dc:description":"Parallel fusion is conventionally defined as a form of complex number for 2-feature.

Based on that, we proposed a new quality index which could be seen as an expanded index of the global quality measurement Q4. In our method, we first measured the spectral information preserving quality between the MS image and the fusion result. Then, we constructed a virtual spatial detail image considering the spatial resolution ratio between the source MS image and the PAN image, and also extracted the detail image contained in the merged image using the same technology, followed by a spatial information preserving quality index calculated from these two detail images. At last, we integrated the two indices by means of weighted addition determined by fusion model. To illustrate the superiority of this new index, we took experiments on two pairs of ZY-2 PAN and ASTER MS (1 2 3 bands) remote sensing imageries, and adopted the tradeoff FIHS fusion method in which the tradeoff parameter was set to different values standing for different fusion models. After using the proposed index to assess the quality of fusion, we think that the new index is compliant with subjective evaluations and could therefore be used to compare different image fusion or to find the best parameters for a given fusion model. Finally, we gave an experiential weight parameter of the quality index while assessing the tradeoff FIHS fusion with images from these two sensors by the author's experiments. © 2008 SPIE.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033466","afid":"60033466","affilname":"Institute of Remote Sensing Application Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24781508900","authid":"24781508900","authname":"Wang Z.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Zhongwu","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033466"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404147874","authid":"7404147874","authname":"Zhao Z.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Zhongminga","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033466"}]}],"authkeywords":"Fusion model | Non-reference quality assessment | Pan-sharpen | Quaternion algebra | Weight parameter","article-number":"71460V","source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/58249134232"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/58249134232?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=58249134232&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=58249134232&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/58249134232","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:58249134232","eid":"2-s2.0-58249134232","dc:title":"A new satellite attitude determination system integrating antennas with attitude sensors","dc:creator":"Xia K.","prism:publicationName":"Xibei Gongye Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Northwestern Polytechnical University","prism:issn":"10002758","prism:volume":"26","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"727-731","prism:coverDate":"2008-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2008","dc:description":"Aim. To our knowledge, existing methods in the open literature [1, 2] still use attitude sensors alone; in our opinion, they cannot satisfy the increasing precision of satellite attitude determination required by satellite missions now. We propose utilizing attitude information inherently contained in antenna measurements to increase greatly the precision of attitude determination. In the full paper, we explain our attitude determination system in some detail; in this abstract, we just add some pertinent remarks to naming the first three sections of the full paper. Section 1 is: The residual error model of antenna measurements. In section 1, we analyze the information contained in antenna signals to be used for attitude determination and then establish the residual error model of antenna measurements expressed in terms of error quaternions as shown in eq. (11). Section 2 is: The residual error model of attitude sensor measurements. Section 3 is: The satellite attitude determination system integrating antennas with attitude sensors. In this section, using the residual error model of attitude sensor measurements and that of antenna measurements, we set up our satellite attitude determination system that integrates gyros, antennas, infrared horizon sensors and solar sensors by using the working principles of our system given in the block diagram as shown in Fig. 1. Then we estimate the attitude of a satellite by fusing the measurements and utilizing the Kalman filtering. Finally we simulate our satellite attitude determination system. The simulation results, shown in Fig. 2, indicate preliminarily that both the accuracy and convergence speed of attitude determination can be improved greatly by introducing the attitude information of antenna signals.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003977","afid":"60003977","affilname":"Northwestern Polytechnical University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58360646100","authid":"58360646100","authname":"Xia K.","surname":"Xia","given-name":"Keqiang","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401723088","authid":"7401723088","authname":"Zhou F.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Fengqi","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55224627900","authid":"55224627900","authname":"Zhou J.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Jun","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192565976","authid":"57192565976","authname":"Liu Y.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Yingying","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003977"}]}],"authkeywords":"Antennas | Attitude determination | Error quaternion | Kalman filters | Sensors","source-id":"15242","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/58249092884"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/58249092884?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=58249092884&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=58249092884&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/58249092884","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:58249092884","eid":"2-s2.0-58249092884","dc:title":"Online calibration of camera with changeable extrinsic parameters based on DSP","dc:creator":"Jiang J.","prism:publicationName":"Yi Qi Yi Biao Xue Bao/Chinese Journal of Scientific Instrument","prism:issn":"02543087","prism:volume":"29","prism:issueIdentifier":"12","prism:pageRange":"2617-2621","prism:coverDate":"2008-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"December 2008","dc:description":"A method of online camera calibration with changeable extrinsic parameters is proposed.

Thus, after calibrating the camera in the initial position, based on real-time control of the rotating time using DSP, the extrinsic parameters after each rotation can be calculated quickly.

The latter representation is being intensively exploited in many applications, because of the compact description and interesting properties. In the paper the filtering method for rotational trajectories is proposed. We generalize anisotropic diffusion process defined for two dimensional images, taking into consideration specific properties of rotational motion. Filtering of trajectories in Euclidean space has already been researched in detail using different approaches. However, the straightforward application of well known filtering methods for the rotational space fails to produce appropriate results.

According to the quaternion singular value decomposition theory, in a color image, the singular values on the diagonal matrix, which were obtained through QSVD, represent the color images in different channels. The additive noise of a color image can be eliminated effectively by keeping the proper singular values, that represent normal image signal, and discarding the noise values. Through the color image energy model, we can reconstruct the image singular values and selectively eliminate the singular values which represent the noise. As the result, the proposed algorithm can de-noise color image rapidly, and also it can be implemented easily in practice.
