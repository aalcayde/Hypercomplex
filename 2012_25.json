However, conventional Pan-sharpening processes are based on color separation (RGB decomposition for example) of color (spectral) images resulting in significant loss of color information. The aim of this work is to investigate the potential of hypercomplex numbers representation of color images, in particular Quaternion model, for satellite images pan-sharpening. Quaternion model allows color images to be handled as a whole, rather than as color-separated components. That is, the values of the color components (R, G and B for example) of each pixel of a color image are represented as a single pure quaternion valued pixel. The proposed fusion method is based on Quaternion intensity-hue-saturation (QIHS) transform and consists of three steps. First, the color (spectral) image is represented as a pure quaternion image to take into account its particular nature. Then, the IHS transform is applied to the pure quaternion image resampled at the scale of panchromatic (Pan) image. Finally, the image fusion process is done by IHS-based component substitution. The efficiency of the proposed method is tested on Quickbird dataset. A comparative evaluation among the proposed technique and the standard IHS-based method available in the commercial software ENVI is then conducted. © 2012 SPIE.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60090986","afid":"60090986","affilname":"Centre National des Techniques Spatiale, Oran","affiliation-city":"Arzew","affiliation-country":"Algeria"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23097976100","authid":"23097976100","authname":"Serief C.","surname":"Serief","given-name":"Chahira","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60090986"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55196174500","authid":"55196174500","authname":"Mahi H.","surname":"Mahi","given-name":"Habib","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60090986"}]}],"authkeywords":"Image fusion | Pan-sharpening | Quaternion intensity-hue-saturation (QIHS) transform | Quaternion model | Satellite images","article-number":"85371N","source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84875616687"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84875616687?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84875616687&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84875616687&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84875616687","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84875616687","eid":"2-s2.0-84875616687","dc:title":"Image denoising using selective neighboring quaternionic wavelet coefficients","dc:creator":"Kadiri M.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the International Conference on Microelectronics, ICM","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781467352925"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2012-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICM.2012.6471420","dc:description":"Removing noise for image is a classical problem in image processing but it is still relevant issue. In this paper, we adopt an innovative and original approach, which is combined between a recent quaternionic wavelet transform and selective neighbouring coefficients to image denoising. The choice of quaternionic transformation is justified by the fact that it gives a very good separation of the coefficients in terms of amplitude and 3-angles phase. This representation generalizes better the concept of analytic signal to the image. Quaternionic transformation retains property of shift invariant but it allows the introduction of a true 2D analysis compared with the traditional complex wavelet transform. After decomposition, selective neighbouring coefficients are used for denoising. Interesting results are obtained by comparing in term of PSNR with the complex wavelet transform and the discrete wavelet transform. © 2012 IEEE.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60068748","afid":"60068748","affilname":"Université Djillali Liabes de Sidi Bel Abbes","affiliation-city":"Sidi Bel Abbes","affiliation-country":"Algeria"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032653","afid":"60032653","affilname":"Universite de Poitiers","affiliation-city":"Poitiers","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55355545400","authid":"55355545400","authname":"Kadiri M.","surname":"Kadiri","given-name":"Mohammed","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60068748"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14062847200","authid":"14062847200","authname":"Djebbouri M.","surname":"Djebbouri","given-name":"Mohamed","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60068748"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36008284700","authid":"36008284700","authname":"Carré P.","surname":"Carré","given-name":"Pilippe","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032653"}]}],"authkeywords":"Complex Wavelet Transform | Image denoising | Neighboring coefficients | Quaternionic Wavelet Transform | Thresholding","article-number":"6471420","source-id":"144854","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84875038502"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84875038502?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84875038502&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84875038502&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84875038502","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84875038502","eid":"2-s2.0-84875038502","dc:title":"Real-time motion recognition based on skeleton animation","dc:creator":"Hong C.","prism:publicationName":"2012 5th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, CISP 2012","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781467309622"}],"prism:pageRange":"1648-1652","prism:coverDate":"2012-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","prism:doi":"10.1109/CISP.2012.6469956","dc:description":"We propose a novel real-time motion recognition method based on hierarchical skeleton model.

Often such navigation systems use an on-board computer to combine the IMU's gyro and accelerometer measurements with the star tracker's attitude measurements using a Kalman filter. The proposed alignment method adds three states to this navigation filter to estimate the error in a given coarse alignment quaternion. On ground, the alignment quaternion can be accurately measured by navigating with the on-board system while the star tracker points towards the night sky and takes measurements. The vehicle is rotated in several positions to image the night sky from different angles. Each change of orientation provides the navigation system with additional measurements of gravity, Earth rate, angle slews and star tracker quaternions, all of which help improve the filter's estimate of the alignment quaternion. Alignment can also be done during the mission, however gravity and Earth rate measurements may not be available. Alignment accuracy depends on the IMU's error characteristics and the star tracker's accuracy. This technique is used for the Hybrid Navigation System and is compared to a traditional indoor alignment method which uses a checkerboard optical target.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007798","afid":"60007798","affilname":"Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR)","affiliation-city":"Koln","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8454301500","authid":"8454301500","authname":"Steffes S.","surname":"Steffes","given-name":"Stephen R.","initials":"S.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007798"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004187653","authid":"7004187653","authname":"Samaan M.","surname":"Samaan","given-name":"Malak A.","initials":"M.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007798"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6604025103","authid":"6604025103","authname":"Theil S.","surname":"Theil","given-name":"Stephan","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007798"}]}],"source-id":"12376","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84874577412"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84874577412?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84874577412&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84874577412&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84874577412","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84874577412","eid":"2-s2.0-84874577412","dc:title":"3D point tracking and pose estimation of a space object using stereo images","dc:creator":"Oumer N.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - International Conference on Pattern Recognition","prism:issn":"10514651","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9784990644109"}],"prism:pageRange":"796-800","prism:coverDate":"2012-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","dc:description":"In this paper, we present a novel method for stereo camera-based 3D tracking which integrates point-kinematics, associated to each visual feature into Kalman filters. The approach utilizes optical flow and stereo correspondence of visible, predominatly specular features on a target satellite surface, in order to estimate translational and rotational velocities of the rigid body. The motion of each 3D point cloud can be predicted, since all point clouds are constrained by the common, rigid motion. A dual quaternion-based pose estimator, robustified with median statistics, is further applied to the estimated points. In case of temporarily missing measurements, the last estimated body velocity is used to predict the next poses. Experimental results based on images of a satellite simulator are shown to demonstrate performances for on-orbit servicing. © 2012 ICPR Org Committee.","citedby-count":"33","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007798","afid":"60007798","affilname":"Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR)","affiliation-city":"Koln","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55365179500","authid":"55365179500","authname":"Oumer N.","surname":"Oumer","given-name":"Nassir W.","initials":"N.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007798"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23397732500","authid":"23397732500","authname":"Panin G.","surname":"Panin","given-name":"Giorgio","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007798"}]}],"article-number":"6460254","source-id":"24282","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84874577131"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84874577131?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84874577131&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84874577131&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84874577131","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84874577131","eid":"2-s2.0-84874577131","dc:title":"Gyro fault prediction algorithm based on UKF","dc:creator":"Jun C.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of 2012 International Conference on Image Analysis and Signal Processing, IASP 2012","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781467325455"}],"prism:pageRange":"196-199","prism:coverDate":"2012-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","prism:doi":"10.1109/IASP.2012.6425022","dc:description":"Aimed at the gradient failure of the gyro drift increases, an algorithm based on estimating the angular rate according to the UKF and attitude kinematic equation for gyro fault prediction is presented in this paper. We use quaternion to describe the attitude kinematics equation, and the UKF filter model is created, which takes the satellite attitude angle and the gyro angular rate as the state variable, and the attitude angle is based on a sun sensor and an earth sensor as the observed variable. According to the residuals of the estimated angular rate and gyro measurement values, the gyro failure prediction method is presented. This method may avoid the error caused by kinetic equation, which may be limited by the spacecraft's inertial and control moment and the shortage of the EKF and the PF. A simulation system is developed. The result shows that the algorithm can predict the gradient failure of the gyro drift increasing timely and accurately.

Such areas include communications, image processing and biological systems. Quaternion valued data has also been drawing recent interest in various areas of statistical signal processing, including adaptive filtering, image pattern recognition, and modeling and tracking of motion. The benefit for quaternion valued processing includes performing data transformations in a 3 or 4-dimensional space in a more convenient fashion than using vector algebra. In this paper we describe an alternative kernel adaptive filter for quaternion valued data we refer to as the involution Quaternion Kernel Least Mean Square (iQuat-KLMS) algorithm. The approach is based on the Quaternion KLMS (Quat-KLMS) algorithm obtained previously, as well as the recently-developed involution gradient (i-gradient). A modified HR Calculus for Hilbert spaces is used for finding cost function gradients defined on a quaternion RKHS. Simulation tests with a synthetic quaternion channel are used to verify the benefit of iQuat-KLMS in convergence compared to Quat-KLMS. © 2012 APSIPA.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010451","afid":"60010451","affilname":"Santa Clara University","affiliation-city":"Santa Clara","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004919562","authid":"7004919562","authname":"Ogunfunmi T.","surname":"Ogunfunmi","given-name":"Tokunbo","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010451"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26435566700","authid":"26435566700","authname":"Paul T.","surname":"Paul","given-name":"Thomas","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010451"}]}],"article-number":"6411856","source-id":"21100229828","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84874424552"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84874424552?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84874424552&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84874424552&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84874424552","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84874424552","eid":"2-s2.0-84874424552","dc:title":"Salient traffic sign recognition based on sparse representation of visual perception","dc:creator":"Li C.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision in Remote Sensing, CVRS 2012","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781467312738"}],"prism:pageRange":"273-278","prism:coverDate":"2012-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","prism:doi":"10.1109/CVRS.2012.6421274","dc:description":"This paper proposes a new approach to recognize salient traffic signs, which is based on sparse representation of visual perception via visual saliency and speeded up robust features (SURF) algorithm.

This can be used for the high precision determination of a vehicle attitude. The use of these measurements requires the determination of the integer carrier phase ambiguities, which is a problem usually addressed with dual-frequency receivers. However, the high cost of these receivers lead to a strong motivation regarding the development of techniques using low-cost single-frequency receivers. In this paper, a high precision attitude determination technique, using a quaternion-based Extended Kalman Filter, based on multiple baselines is proposed, using low cost single frequency L1 GPS receivers. Test results with real data are presented. © 2012 IEEE.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104136","afid":"60104136","affilname":"Instituto de Sistemas e Robótica","affiliation-city":"Lisbon","affiliation-country":"Portugal"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017375","afid":"60017375","affilname":"Instituto de Telecomunicações","affiliation-city":"Aveiro","affiliation-country":"Portugal"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55366230000","authid":"55366230000","authname":"Coias J.","surname":"Coias","given-name":"Joao","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017375"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24469075900","authid":"24469075900","authname":"Sanguino J.","surname":"Sanguino","given-name":"Jose","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017375"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55751743873","authid":"55751743873","authname":"Oliveira P.","surname":"Oliveira","given-name":"Paulo","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104136"}]}],"authkeywords":"Ambiguity Filter | Attitude determination | GPS | LAMBDA method | RTK","article-number":"6423076","source-id":"21100229240","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84873980239"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84873980239?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84873980239&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84873980239&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84873980239","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84873980239","eid":"2-s2.0-84873980239","dc:title":"Quaternion model of video quality assessment weighted by gray-level co-occurrence","dc:creator":"Li G.","prism:publicationName":"2012 International Conference on Wavelet Active Media Technology and Information Processing, ICWAMTIP 2012","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781467346856"}],"prism:pageRange":"193-196","prism:coverDate":"2012-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICWAMTIP.2012.6413472","dc:description":"In this paper, we proposed a new video quality metric model, which describe the video quality feature using quaternion matrix.

In addition we extract gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) of each block, then calculate differential entropy of GLCM as the weight of the block.

One outstanding feature of ISSAC is its tilting capability in cross-track direction so that a wide area can be covered. At a relatively low altitude, the ISS, where the ISSAC will be hosted, experiences a large variation in attitude. Additionally, the optics window on ISS where the ISSAC sees through is not at the center of mass of the ISS. All these factors need to be taken care of in the algorithm.

Real multipliers related to lifting steps are approximated using 2D CORDIC iterations, or bit shifts and additions. The resulting multiplierless scheme requires less chip area than a direct fixed-point implementation of the multiplications and is better suited to pipelining. However its design and implementation are difficult, which has been verified by VHDL/FPGA-based development of a universal processing unit for multiplying quaternions which is also described herein. Although the precision of CORDIC-based computations is finite, the lifting scheme ensures that obtainable approximations of hypercomplex multiplications are perfectly invertible. Because of this property, the solution can find applications in lossless compression of audio and video data. © 2012 IEEE.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60043973","afid":"60043973","affilname":"Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics","affiliation-city":"Minsk","affiliation-country":"Belarus"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002096","afid":"60002096","affilname":"Bialystok University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Bialystok","affiliation-country":"Poland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56511553600","authid":"56511553600","authname":"Petrovsky N.A.","surname":"Petrovsky","given-name":"Nicolai A.","initials":"N.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60043973"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6506558733","authid":"6506558733","authname":"Parfieniuk M.","surname":"Parfieniuk","given-name":"Marek","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002096"}]}],"article-number":"6382236","source-id":"21100226437","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84872153794"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84872153794?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84872153794&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84872153794&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84872153794","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84872153794","eid":"2-s2.0-84872153794","dc:title":"Tracking articulator movements using orientation measurements","dc:creator":"Ji A.","prism:publicationName":"ICALIP 2012 - 2012 International Conference on Audio, Language and Image Processing, Proceedings","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781467301718"}],"prism:pageRange":"292-296","prism:coverDate":"2012-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICALIP.2012.6376628","dc:description":"This paper introduces a new method to track articulator movements, specifically jaw position and angle, using 5 degree of freedom (5 DOF) orientation data.

However, the RGB color space is a relatively weak color space for face recognition due to the strong correlation between the three color channels. A technique named color space normalization (CSN) technique can reduce the correlation between the three channels of the RGB color space, and enhance the discriminating power of the normalized color space RGB-N. Therefore, in this paper, a method based on normalized color space RGB-N and quaternion matrix representation is firstly proposed. The proposed method not only has the advantage of quaternion matrix representation model, but also has the strong discriminating power due to CSN.

Brain function originates in the precise integration of activities of different neural structures. The peculiar richness of the brain's integrative output is dependent upon the development of multiple anatomical subregions, each having cytological and functional specificity. This requires stringent developmental patterning in space and time of the molecular and cellular processes that build up the hypercomplex structure of the brain. A delicate balance between spatio-temporal sequences of gene expression regulates normal brain development, forming a complex causal network. It reviews the cartography of genes which is known to represent key factors for brain development in the neural tube, focusing mainly on those that code for morphogenetic information: signaling molecules and transcription factors. The neuroepithelium of the neural plate and tube contains the progenitors for the neural cells-neurons and glia-that will jointly form operative brain structures. Cells at different initial domains of these primordia receive multiple morphogenetic positional signals, encoded by graded distribution of signaling molecules produced at restricted sites within or outside the developmental field. These signals act upon specific receptors expressed in the neuroepithelial cells and regulate at each locus the expression of a specific set of transcription factors controlling proliferation, neurogenesis, and cellular differentiation and eventually, the emergence of connections and functional properties. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The vertices of the four-dimensional semiregular polytope snub 24-cell and its symmetry group (W(D 4)/C 2): S 3 of order 576 are obtained from the quaternionic representation of the CoxeterWeyl group W(D 4). The symmetry group is an extension of the proper subgroup of the CoxeterWeyl group W(D 4) by the permutation symmetry of the CoxeterDynkin diagram D 4. The 96 vertices of the snub 24-cell are obtained as the orbit of the group when it acts on the vector Λ = (τ, 1, τ, τ) or on the vector Λ = (σ, 1, σ, σ) in the Dynkin basis with τ = 1+√5/2 and σ = 1-√5/2. The two different sets represent the mirror images of the snub 24-cell. When two mirror images are combined it leads to a quasiregular four-dimensional polytope invariant under the CoxeterWeyl group W(F 4). Each vertex of the new polytope is shared by one cube and three truncated octahedra. Dual of the snub 24-cell is also constructed. Relevance of these structures to the Coxeter groups W(H 4) and W(E 8) has been pointed out. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60071768","afid":"60071768","affilname":"Sultan Qaboos University","affiliation-city":"Muscat","affiliation-country":"Oman"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55119162500","authid":"55119162500","authname":"Koca M.","surname":"Koca","given-name":"Mehmet","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60071768"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195349633","authid":"57195349633","authname":"Koca N.O.","surname":"Koca","given-name":"Nazife Ozdes","initials":"N.O.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60071768"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602956774","authid":"6602956774","authname":"Al-Barwani M.","surname":"Al-Barwani","given-name":"Muataz","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60071768"}]}],"authkeywords":"quaternions | Snub 24-cell | the CoxeterWeyl group W(D  ) 4","article-number":"1250068","source-id":"4700152702","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84869782365"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84869782365?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84869782365&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84869782365&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84869782365","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84869782365","eid":"2-s2.0-84869782365","dc:title":"Hypercomplex Bark-scale filter bank design based on allpass-phase specifications","dc:creator":"Alfsmann D.","prism:publicationName":"European Signal Processing Conference","prism:issn":"22195491","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781467310680"}],"prism:pageRange":"519-523","prism:coverDate":"2012-11-27","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","dc:description":"With telephony and hearing aids in mind, we present in this research paper an I-channel Bark-scale filter bank approach (I=2D, Dε ℕ) that employs a hypercomplex (i.e. multi-hyperbolic) allpass filter as a filter bank. Efficient computation is assured by maximal orthogonal decomposition of the selected multi-hyperbolic algebra. The main advantages of this approach are: i) parallel processing of the subband signals, ii) designability of arbitrarily non-uniform filter banks, and iii) robustness (=losslessness) as a result of the double complementarity of (hypercomplex) allpass functions. © 2012 EURASIP.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005322","afid":"60005322","affilname":"Ruhr-Universitat Bochum","affiliation-city":"Bochum","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16032739100","authid":"16032739100","authname":"Alfsmann D.","surname":"Alfsmann","given-name":"Daniel","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005322"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6505819339","authid":"6505819339","authname":"Göckler H.","surname":"Göckler","given-name":"Heinz G.","initials":"H.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005322"}]}],"article-number":"6333826","source-id":"21100204301","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
