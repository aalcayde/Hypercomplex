By using the theory of singular perturbation and the globally nonsingular unit quaternion representation for the orientation error, a nonlinear feedback control is designed. The use of quaternions allows us to avoid the drawbacks of Euler angle approach, namely singularities which can occur in large maneuvers. The feedback control system exhibits robustness properties with respect to disturbances and plant parametric uncertainties. The resulting control signal remains, after a fast transient, in a neighborhood of the well-defined equivalent control avoiding the peaking phenomenon of high gain systems. The proposed control technique is then applied to a complete satellite rotation about a fixed axis.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/101477116","afid":"101477116","affilname":"Seconda Universita degli Sudi di","affiliation-city":"Aversa","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101973817","authid":"7101973817","authname":"Cavallo A.","surname":"Cavallo","given-name":"Alberto","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"101477116"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006281223","authid":"7006281223","authname":"De Maria G.","surname":"De Maria","given-name":"Giuseppe","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"101477116"}]}],"source-id":"95750","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030383380"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030383380?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0030383380&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0030383380&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030383380","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0030383380","eid":"2-s2.0-0030383380","dc:title":"Combined filter for GPS-based attitude and baseline estimation","dc:creator":"Ward L.M.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of ION GPS","prism:volume":"1","prism:pageRange":"1047-1061","prism:coverDate":"1996-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1996","dc:description":"This paper describes a methodology for combining attitude and baseline estimation into one comprehensive filter. The nominal filter states include attitude quaternion errors, angular velocity errors, and baseline errors. The approach in terms of baseline errors is to estimate a scalar correction to one baseline, an angle correction to the second baseline, and a vector correction to the third. Reducing the baseline error states in this way provides the necessary attitude observability while allowing for baseline calibration. Previous approaches have relied on determining accurate baselines first (either on-orbit or on the ground) and then using those baselines for attitude estimation. The method presented here combines these two steps into one algorithm. The advantage is that baseline calibration can be performed while simultaneously producing attitude information. Results from simulated data as well as flight data from the RADCAL and CRISTA-SPAS satellites are presented.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000221","afid":"60000221","affilname":"University of Colorado Boulder","affiliation-city":"Boulder","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201849914","authid":"7201849914","authname":"Ward L.M.","surname":"Ward","given-name":"Lisa M.","initials":"L.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000221"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003948630","authid":"7003948630","authname":"Axelrad P.","surname":"Axelrad","given-name":"Penina","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000221"}]}],"source-id":"65743","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030260155"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030260155?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0030260155&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0030260155&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030260155","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0030260155","eid":"2-s2.0-0030260155","dc:title":"Fourier transforms of colour images using quaternion or hypercomplex, numbers","dc:creator":"Sangwine S.","prism:publicationName":"Electronics Letters","prism:issn":"00135194","prism:volume":"32","prism:issueIdentifier":"21","prism:pageRange":"1979-1980","prism:coverDate":"1996-10-10","prism:coverDisplayDate":"10 October 1996","prism:doi":"10.1049/el:19961331","dc:description":"The 2D quaternion, or hypercomplex, Fourier transform is introduced.

But automatic digitizing for 3D objects is the key challenge for todays 3D computer graphics. The goal of this paper is to present research avenues towards direct 3D digitizing with multi-views cameras, in order to design 3D objects as simply as 2D scanning. Recent advances in low level vision analysis gave interesting results related to Automatic neurofocalisation, and perceptive grouping, mainly thanks to Professor Burnod researches and his team in the field of Neuro Visual hardware models. These techniques are based on multiscale hypercomplex filters such as Gaussian, Laplacian derivatives, and are able to automatically compute highly informative points or zones such as: vertices, vectors, lips, eyes, mouth etc...on natural scenes. These informations can be the basis of keypoints for spline control points.These image analysis tools are giving Neurofocalisation output informations. They simulate the low level attractiveness of the Neuro-Visual system in the brain: Neurons can be considered functionnally as hardware filters, as they perform sum of products. Neuro-visual simulations demonstrate for example that neuron ouputs are giving directly matrix transform coefficients, and edge transition in the brain. It would be envisageable to consider a new kind of filter-based data structures instead of splines/polygons. Such data base could facilitate the gap between 3D objetcs and image processing elements. (The terms used in MPEG4/SNHC is VOP for video object planes: It's the first time that an image element other than contour, edge, etc, is considered as an object. Some demonstrations and hardware simulations will be presented. Moreover, these results can be implemented in hardware. The cortical column as defined by Professor Burnod is a set of complex filters which can be simulated and integrated as well as classic digital filters. Such informations can be used as inputs for new modelling systems which could design 3D objects without interactive graphical interface via software modellers. At present, only interactive US commercial products are available. These products need an operator who must interactively input in the system vertices and polygon positions. These tasks are very long and boring, thus already a little bit easier than traditionnal modelling systems which need a complete construction with mathematical shapes, or adaptive meshing. The real take-off for 3D graphics will begin when 3D digitizing will be as simple as a camera or scanner. Some NASA systems are beginning to automate this digitizing task. Such techniques could enhance classical input design for a large sets of objects. Moreover, it would be possible to define new data structures based on generalized multiscale filters more than splines/polygons. A new direct bridge could be created between image analysis and svnthesis, and for mixing hybrid scenes, (as in MPEG4-SNHC goals). Recent simulation models of the Neural Visual Cortex in the brain have been developped for merging 3D image & object analysis with 3D Synthesis for ultra-high image compression (MPEG4) and analysis research environment.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104081","afid":"60104081","affilname":"Orange Labs","affiliation-city":"Issy-les-Moulineaux","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602174786","authid":"6602174786","authname":"Leray P.","surname":"Leray","given-name":"P.","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104081"}]}],"authkeywords":"30 image analysis &amp; synthesis | Compression | Functionnalities | MPEG4 | Neural networks | Simulation | Visual systems","source-id":"21101074759","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030469636"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030469636?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0030469636&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0030469636&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030469636","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0030469636","eid":"2-s2.0-0030469636","dc:title":"Analytic signals for multivariate data","dc:creator":"Craig M.","prism:publicationName":"Mathematical Geology","prism:issn":"08828121","prism:volume":"28","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"315-329","prism:coverDate":"1996-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1996","prism:doi":"10.1007/BF02083203","dc:description":"Hilbert transformation is a standard tool in univariate signal-processing. It leaves the information content unaffected for, apart from a change of sign, the iterated transform reproduces the original data. As we know from Fourier transforms, such alternative representations of the same information, notwithstanding their theoretical equivalence with the data, can assist powerfully with extracting and interpreting that information. Although the extension to multivariate data is not so obvious for Hilbert as for Fourier transforms, Nabighian gave a treatment of the bivariate situation in 1984. Fueter, some 50 years earlier, had worked on an analogous extension problem, seeking to generalize complex function theory. On comparing these two developments we learn that, although Nabighian's transforms fit naturally into Fueter's theory, they are only one among many alternative possibilities.

The realization is considered for the case where the two arbitrary complex coefficient transfer functions do and do not have a common denominator. It is shown that the transfer functions can be realized by the hypercomplex coefficient network of the same order in the former case and by the hypercomplex coefficient network with the half-order in the latter case. The realization of the transfer functions with the common denominator is interesting, but the general method to derive the transfer functions is not known. From such a viewpoint, this paper proposes the discrete-type Kautz approximation with the positive frequency as the domain of approximation, including the optimal pole determination algorithm. By this approach, two complex coefficient transfer functions with an n-thorder common denominator are derived from the two 2n-th-order real or complex coefficient transfer functions. The method can be considered as one that simultaneously approximates the amplitude and the phase. The proposed approximation method is an approximation only for the positive frequency domain, and the property of the analytic signal that the negative frequency component is zero can be utilized. As a result, the method proposed in this paper has the advantages that the degree of freedom in the filter design is enhanced and the sampling frequency can be halved. In addition, the network structure can be simplified.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025997","afid":"60025997","affilname":"Keio University","affiliation-city":"Tokyo","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36985613900","authid":"36985613900","authname":"Ueda K.","surname":"Ueda","given-name":"Kazuhiro","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025997"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7407711000","authid":"7407711000","authname":"Takahashi S.I.","surname":"Takahashi","given-name":"Shin Ichi","initials":"S.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025997"}]}],"authkeywords":"Digital filter | Hypercomplex number | Orthonormal functions | Positive frequency approximation | Simultaneous approximation of amplitude and phase","source-id":"24908","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030190165"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030190165?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0030190165&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0030190165&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030190165","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0030190165","eid":"2-s2.0-0030190165","dc:title":"Attitude control for low lift/drag re-entry vehicles","dc:creator":"Cavallo A.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics","prism:issn":"07315090","prism:eIssn":"15333884","prism:volume":"19","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"816-822","prism:coverDate":"1996-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July/August 1996","prism:doi":"10.2514/3.21704","dc:description":"We propose an attitude control system for a re-entry capsule with a low lift/drag ratio (0.3). The control law is based on quaternions and on a sliding manifold approach. By using the singular perturbation theory, a feedback controller is designed with robustness properties with respect to structural parametric uncertainties and environmental disturbances. The system state remains in a neighborhood of a reference attitude and the control signal is close to the well-defined equivalent control. The reference attitude is commanded by a trajectory controller that steers the vehicle on a reference precalculated path. This controller is based on a time-varying linear quadratic and a variable structure system strategy to meet landing accuracy requirements. Moreover, a new modulator scheme is proposed to modulate the thrust torque commanded by the attitude controller. The overall control law is tested by using a six-degree-of-freedom model of the capsule, taking into account an oblate rotating Earth, and gravitational field, aerodynamics, propulsive forces, and moments. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy in meeting the requirements on landing accuracy and on heating and load factor limits.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60082509","afid":"60082509","affilname":"Centro Italiano Ricerche Aerospaziali","affiliation-city":"Capua","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026777","afid":"60026777","affilname":"Università degli Studi della Campania Luigi Vanvitelli","affiliation-city":"Naples","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101973817","authid":"7101973817","authname":"Cavallo A.","surname":"Cavallo","given-name":"Alberto","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026777"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006281223","authid":"7006281223","authname":"De Maria G.","surname":"De Maria","given-name":"Giuseppe","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026777"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101981299","authid":"7101981299","authname":"Ferrara F.","surname":"Ferrara","given-name":"Ferdinando","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60082509"}]}],"source-id":"29586","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030150550"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030150550?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0030150550&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0030150550&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030150550","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0030150550","eid":"2-s2.0-0030150550","dc:title":"Attitude determination and control of Clementine during lunar mapping","dc:creator":"Creamer G.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics","prism:issn":"07315090","prism:eIssn":"15333884","prism:volume":"19","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"505-511","prism:coverDate":"1996-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May/June 1996","prism:doi":"10.2514/3.21650","dc:description":"The Clementine spacecraft, launched in early 1994, recently completed a two-month lunar mapping mission in which it recorded high-resolution images over the entire surface of the moon.

The attitude control subsystem consisted of a simple proportional-integral-derivative algorithm operating on quaternion and rate feedback signals to provide pointing, tracking, and slewing functions. The primary actuating devices were three reaction wheels used for feedback error compensation and 12 thrusters used for occasional momentum dumping. During lunar mapping the attitude determination and control subsystems maintained vehicle pointing to within a three-axis rss value of 0.05 deg.

Gleicher and A. Witkin [Comput. Graphics 26(2), 1992, 331-340], provides a powerful user interface for the control of the virtual camera in 3D computer graphics and animation. Their techique is based on locally inverting the nonlinear perspective viewing transformation. However, given m image control points, the Jacobian matrix is derived as a quite complex 2m × 8 matrix; furthermore, the Jacobian matrix always has at least one redundant column since its rank can be 7 at most. For the overconstrained case of m ≥ 4, the Lagrange equation is always singular since its 2m × 2m square matrix has rank 7 at most. All these complications result from removing the constraint q2w + q2x + q2y + q2z = 1 for unit quaternions (qw, qx, qy, qz) ∈ S3 which represent the camera rotations. In this paper, we interpret the problem as a target tracking problem and formulate it as a constrianed nonlinear inversion problem. The problem is then solved by integrating a tangent vector field defined on the configuration space of the virtual camera. The vector field is given by the least-squares solutions of the Jacobian matrix equations. The row and column weighting scheme for the Jacobian matrix provides a convenient way to control the desired least-squares solutions and the associated vector field. The Lie group structure of the unit quaternion space S3 enables us to derive a simple 2m × 7 Jacobian matrix, which improves both the computational efficiency and numerical stability of the overall algorithm. For the overconstrained case of m ≥ 4, the Jacobian matrix equation is solved (in the least-squares sense) by using an efficient projection method with O(m) time complexity. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032330","afid":"60032330","affilname":"Pohang University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Pohang","affiliation-country":"South Korea"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603616833","authid":"6603616833","authname":"Kyung M.H.","surname":"Kyung","given-name":"Min Ho","initials":"M.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032330"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56163274100","authid":"56163274100","authname":"Kim M.S.","surname":"Kim","given-name":"Myung Soo","initials":"M.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032330"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/17136921800","authid":"17136921800","authname":"Hong S.J.","surname":"Hong","given-name":"Sung Je","initials":"S.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032330"}]}],"source-id":"36249","fund-acr":"MEST","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Ministry of Education, Science and Technology","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030081690"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030081690?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0030081690&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0030081690&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0030081690","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0030081690","eid":"2-s2.0-0030081690","dc:title":"Feature-specific vector quantization of images","dc:creator":"Wegmann B.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","prism:issn":"10577149","prism:volume":"5","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"274-288","prism:coverDate":"1996-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1996","prism:doi":"10.1109/83.480763","pii":"S1057714996014121","dc:description":"A new interband vector quantization of a human vision-based image representation is presented. The feature-specific vector quantizer (FVQ) is suited for data compression beyond second-order decorrelation. The scheme is derived from statistical investigations of natural images and from the processing principles of biological vision systems. The initial stage of the coding algorithm is a hierarchical, size-and orientation-selective, analytic bandpass decomposition, realized by even- and odd-symmetric filter pairs that are modeled after the simple cells of the visual cortex. The outputs of each even- and odd-symmetric filter pair are interpreted as real and imaginary parts of an analytic bandpass signal, which is transformed into a local amplitude and a local phase component according to the operation of cortical complex cells. Feature-specific multidimensional vector quantization is realized by combining the amplitude/phase samples of all orientation niters of one resolution layer. The resulting vectors are suited for a classification of the local image features with respect to their intrinsic dimensionality, and enable the exploitation of higher order statistical dependencies between the subbands. This final step is closely related to the operation of cortical hypercomplex or end-stopped cells. The codebook design is based on statistical as well as psychophysical and neurophysiological considerations, and avoids the common shortcomings of perceptually implausible mathematical error criteria. The resulting perceptual quality of compressed images is superior to that obtained with standard vector quantizers of comparable complexity. © 1996 IEEE.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028717","afid":"60028717","affilname":"Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München","affiliation-city":"Munich","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028673","afid":"60028673","affilname":"Siemens AG","affiliation-city":"Munich","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"re","subtypeDescription":"Review","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6604002019","authid":"6604002019","authname":"Wegmann B.","surname":"Wegmann","given-name":"Bernhard","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028673"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56021568900","authid":"56021568900","authname":"Zetzsche C.","surname":"Zetzsche","given-name":"Christoph","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028717"}]}],"source-id":"25534","fund-acr":"DFG","fund-no":"Re 337/7","fund-sponsor":"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0029696308"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0029696308?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0029696308&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0029696308&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0029696308","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0029696308","eid":"2-s2.0-0029696308","dc:title":"Novel block truncation coding of color images by using quaternion-moment-preserving principle","dc:creator":"Pei S.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","prism:issn":"02714310","prism:volume":"2","prism:pageRange":"684-687","prism:coverDate":"1996-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1996","dc:description":"To compress color-pixel blocks, a novel color BTC algorithm, called the quaternion-moment block truncation coding (QMBTC), is presented in this paper.

In this paper, we apply Shoemake's quaternion interpolation formula to pairs of quaternions, known as biquaternions, to obtain an interpolation procedure for spatial motion. A biquaternion represents a rotation in four dimensional space, an element of SO(4). Because a spatial displacement can be viewed as special case of a four dimensional rotation, we can use a biquaternion as an image point of a spatial con_guration and a biquaternion curve to represent spatial movement. We present an example of biquaternion interpolation using four key con_gurations. The result is a smooth movement in SO(4), which we then map to a spatial movement. A comparison with a similar technique based on dual quaternions is provided.","citedby-count":"22","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007278","afid":"60007278","affilname":"University of California, Irvine","affiliation-city":"Irvine","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701389315","authid":"6701389315","authname":"Etzel K.R.","surname":"Etzel","given-name":"Karl R.","initials":"K.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007278"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57212350998","authid":"57212350998","authname":"Michael McCarthy J.","surname":"Michael McCarthy","given-name":"J.","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007278"}]}],"source-id":"21101039466","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0000137005"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0000137005?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0000137005&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0000137005&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0000137005","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:0000137005","eid":"2-s2.0-0000137005","dc:title":"Motion fairing","dc:creator":"Lee J.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - Computer Animation, CA 1996","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"0818675888"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780818675881"}],"prism:pageRange":"136-143","prism:coverDate":"1996-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1996","prism:doi":"10.1109/CA.1996.540496","dc:description":"Motion capturing is widely used for generating realistic motions. A 3D input device captures a sequence of 6 DOF rigid motion samples. The sampled data consists of two components, translation and orientation; the former is represented by a vector in R 3 and the latter by a rotation matrix in the rotation group, SO(3). Since the sequence of data contains sampling noises, the captured motion is now smooth and wiggles along the moving path. There are well-known fairing algorithms in Euclidean space based on difference geometry. Extending these for the motion data, we present a new fairing algorithm. The new algorithm iteratively minimizes the energy function reflecting the forces and torques, exerted on a moving object, to perform motion fairing.","citedby-count":"31","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032144","afid":"60032144","affilname":"Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Daejeon","affiliation-country":"South Korea"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55689897000","authid":"55689897000","authname":"Lee J.","surname":"Lee","given-name":"Jehee","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032144"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403646855","authid":"7403646855","authname":"Shin S.","surname":"Shin","given-name":"Sung Yong","initials":"S.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032144"}]}],"authkeywords":"fairing | Quaternion | rotation | S0(3) | S  3 | signal processing","article-number":"540496","source-id":"21100897145","fund-acr":"MEST","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Ministry of Education, Science and Technology","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
