A rigorous sensor model, which is based on initialization quaternion attitudes and refinement Euler bias angles, is presented. Compared to those models only with quaternion parameters, the proposed model can avoid the difficulties in the decorrelation of attitude parameters, in the refinement model for irregular changing attitudes, and in combined adjustment with attitude angles and other observed values. While comparable to those other models only in the Euler parameters, our model overcomes the problem of multiple solutions and possible singularity. The proposed model exploits existing mature methods found in traditional POS-supported bundle block adjustment to realize rigorous positioning in ECEF with airborne optical images. Tests using frame and three line sensor (TLS) images show that our model is effective and is not restricted by the range of image coverage. It can provide a reference for multiple image positioning including airborne optical images.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60103823","afid":"60103823","affilname":"Changchun Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073462","afid":"60073462","affilname":"Chinese Academy of Surveying and Mapping","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/107984487","afid":"107984487","affilname":"State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35753127200","authid":"35753127200","authname":"Cheng C.","surname":"Cheng","given-name":"Chunquan","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073462"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"107984487"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56058752000","authid":"56058752000","authname":"Zhang J.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Jixian","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073462"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"107984487"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35233640500","authid":"35233640500","authname":"Huang G.","surname":"Huang","given-name":"Guoman","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073462"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57199107533","authid":"57199107533","authname":"Ma J.","surname":"Ma","given-name":"Jing","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"107984487"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60103823"}]}],"authkeywords":"Airborne optical images | Bundle block adjustment | ECEF | Euler bias angles | Quaternion","source-id":"27930","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84966393253"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84966393253?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84966393253&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84966393253&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84966393253","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84966393253","eid":"2-s2.0-84966393253","dc:title":"Reference sensor pattern noise with quaternion-based encryption for DICOM images","dc:creator":"Saraladeve L.","prism:publicationName":"International Journal of Applied Engineering Research","prism:issn":"09734562","prism:eIssn":"09739769","prism:volume":"11","prism:issueIdentifier":"7","prism:pageRange":"5008-5013","prism:coverDate":"2016-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 May 2016","dc:description":"Unwanted artifacts in DICOM images has to be suppressed to improve the quality of images.

This method remains more resistant to JPEG images. After attenuation of noise a quaternion-based lossless encryption is used by modifying the DICOM network which increases the encryption speed of DICOM images. The DICOM image is decomposed in to 8-bit gray tone image which implements Feistel network and uses quaternion rotations in 3D space. Lipschitz quaternions are used to write the image. Quaternion operations are performed using modular arithmetic.

A key parameter in the algorithms is noise level. As a novel tool of image analysis, quaternion wavelet owns some superior properties compared to discrete wavelets, such as nearly shift-invariant wavelet coefficients and phase based texture presentation. We aim to propose an easy and efficient method to estimate the noise level accurately via quaternion wavelet and further improve the denoising performance. We find that the variance sum of high frequency coefficients of quaternion wavelet is approximately equal to the noise level. However, with the advent of strong edges and/or less smooth regions, this metric would overestimate the noise level. Phases in the quaternion wavelet domain can represent the image texture information. On the premise of detecting smooth regions via phases operation, i.e. without many textures, the proposed noise level estimation method is also suitable to images with complex scenes. The performance of the proposed noise level estimation algorithm is demonstrated superior to classical algorithms. Also, the proposed algorithm can enhance those noise level dependent techniques to improve the denoising performances which are competitive to the state-of-art denoising algorithms.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031225","afid":"60031225","affilname":"Kyoto

of interpolation point by calculating the weighted average.We compared the improved method with the spectral quaternion method and the Log-Euclidean method by the simulation data and the real data.The results showed that the improved method could not only keep the monotonicity of the fractional anisotropy(FA)and the determinant of tensors,but also preserve the tensor anisotropy at the same time.In conclusion,the improved method provides a kind of important interpolation method for diffusion tensor image

However, the COLD sensor does not make full use of the two component spatial aperture. The uniform linear array, which consists of COLD sensors, is considered. In order to extend the spatial aperture, all loop-components maintain the same, and all dipole-components are sparsely uniformly stretched along the orthogonal direction, thus an L-shaped array is formed. A generalized rotational invariance based dimension reduction multiple signal classification method (GRIDR-MUSIC) is proposed. The proposed algorithm uses the L-shaped array geometry to separate the steering vector into three parts, and uses the generalized rotational invariance matrix to estimate each part separately, thus direction of arrival (DOA) and polarization parameters can be estimated by only one-dimensional spectral peak search. In addition, a dipole is added in the conference point, and the quaternion model is used to resolve the phase cyclic ambiguity caused by sparsely stretching operation. Finally, the numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025578","afid":"60025578","affilname":"Xidian University","affiliation-city":"Xi'an","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56729271200","authid":"56729271200","authname":"Zhao J.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Jichao","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202328081","authid":"7202328081","authname":"Tao H.","surname":"Tao","given-name":"Haihong","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57214147193","authid":"57214147193","authname":"Gao Z.","surname":"Gao","given-name":"Zhiqi","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025578"}]}],"authkeywords":"COLD sensor | DOA | GRIDR-MUSIC | Polarization","source-id":"96848","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84966460002"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84966460002?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84966460002&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84966460002&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84966460002","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84966460002","eid":"2-s2.0-84966460002","dc:title":"Space resection of big attitude image based on levenberg-marquardt method","dc:creator":"Guo Z.","prism:publicationName":"Wuhan Daxue Xuebao (Xinxi Kexue Ban)/Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University","prism:issn":"16718860","prism:volume":"41","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"565-568","prism:coverDate":"2016-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 April 2016","prism:doi":"10.13203/j.whugis20130706","dc:description":"Determining the exterior orientation parameters of photogrammetry image is an important task, and a lot of classic methods are in use. In the case of large attitude angle in low-altitude remote sensing image, the model of space resection algorithm based on unit quaternion has been used in many experimentations. In this paper, the stable Levenberg-Marquardt method (LM) algorithm is employed to solve the space resection problem of large attitude angle photogrammetry image. The feasibility of the proposed method is validated based on simulation data, Meanwhile, the comparing experimentations between LM algorithm andunit quaternion method show that the LM method is less sensitive to the initialization of exterior orientation parameters. The experiment also shows that the reliability of LM method is equivalent to unit quaternion method. Furthermore, if the damped factor is set suitable, LM method will be more efficient and reliable.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60088582","afid":"60088582","affilname":"PLA Dalian Naval Academy","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100376949","afid":"100376949","affilname":"Naval Institute of Hydrographic Surveying and Charting","affiliation-city":"Tianjin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189246513","authid":"57189246513","authname":"Guo Z.","surname":"Guo","given-name":"Zhonglei","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60088582"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"100376949"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102948323","authid":"7102948323","authname":"Zhai J.","surname":"Zhai","given-name":"Jingsheng","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"100376949"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56213476900","authid":"56213476900","authname":"Deng K.","surname":"Deng","given-name":"Kailiang","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"100376949"}]}],"authkeywords":"Levenberg-Marquardt method | Low-altitude remote sensing | Space resection | Unit quaternions","source-id":"27930","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"41404001","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84955061691"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84955061691?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84955061691&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84955061691&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84955061691","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84955061691","eid":"2-s2.0-84955061691","dc:title":"Unsupervised Quaternion Feature Learning for Remote Sensing Image Classification","dc:creator":"Risojevic V.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","prism:issn":"19391404","prism:eIssn":"21511535","prism:volume":"9","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"1521-1531","prism:coverDate":"2016-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April 2016","prism:doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2513898","dc:description":"Bag-of-words image representations based on local descriptors are common in image classification and retrieval tasks. However, in order to achieve state-of-the-art results, complex hand-crafted feature filters and/or support vector classifiers with nonlinear kernels are needed. Compared with hand-crafted features, unsupervised feature learning is a popular alternative, which results in feature filters adapted to the problem domain at hand. Although both color and intensity are important cues for remote sensing image classification and color images are commonly used for unsupervised feature learning, most of the existing algorithms do not take into account interrelationships between intensity and color information. We address this problem using quaternion representation for color images and propose unsupervised learning of quaternion feature filters, as well as feature encoding using quaternion orthogonal matching pursuit (Q-OMP). By using quaternion representation, we are able to jointly encode intensity and color information in an image. We obtain local descriptors by soft thresholding and computing absolute values of scalar and three vector parts of the quaternion-valued sparse code. Local descriptors are pooled, power-law transformed, and normalized, yielding the resulting image representation. The experimental results on UC Merced Land Use and Brazilian Coffee Scenes datasets are comparable or better than the state of the art, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The proposed method for quaternion feature learning is able to adapt to the characteristics of the available data, and being fully unsupervised, it emerges as a viable alternative to both hand-crafted representations and convolutional neural networks, especially in application scenarios with scarce-labeled training data.","citedby-count":"30","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104200","afid":"60104200","affilname":"University of Banja Luka","affiliation-city":"Banja Luka","affiliation-country":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6504241952","authid":"6504241952","authname":"Risojevic V.","surname":"Risojevic","given-name":"Vladimir","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104200"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8597226400","authid":"8597226400","authname":"Babic Z.","surname":"Babic","given-name":"Zdenka","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104200"}]}],"authkeywords":"Quaternion image processing | remote sensing image classification | sparse image representations | Unsupervised feature learning","article-number":"7387668","source-id":"17700155033","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960081447"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960081447?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84960081447&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84960081447&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960081447","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84960081447","eid":"2-s2.0-84960081447","dc:title":"Quaternion-based signal analysis for motor imagery classification from electroencephalographic signals","dc:creator":"Batres-Mendoza P.","prism:publicationName":"Sensors (Switzerland)","prism:issn":"14248220","prism:volume":"16","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2016-03-05","prism:coverDisplayDate":"5 March 2016","prism:doi":"10.3390/s16030336","dc:description":"Quaternions can be used as an alternative to model the fundamental patterns of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals in the time domain.

The hypercomplex number theory is utilized to derive novel lattice structures in which quaternion multipliers replace Givens (planar) rotations. Unlike the conventional algorithms, the proposed computational schemes maintain losslessness regardless of their coefficient quantization. Moreover, the one regularity conditions can be expressed directly in terms of the quaternion lattice coefficients and thus easily satisfied even in finiteprecision arithmetic. In this paper, a novel approach to realizingCORDIC-lifting factorization of paraunitary filter banks is presented, which is based on the embedding of the CORDIC algorithm inside the lifting scheme. Lifting allows for making multiplications invertible. The 2D CORDIC engine using sparse iterations and asynchronous pipeline processor architecture based on the embedded CORDIC engine as stage of processor is reported. Also it is necessary to notice, that the quaternion multiplier lifting scheme based on the 2D CORDIC algorithm is the structural decision for the lossless digital signal processing. This approach applies to very practical filter banks, which are essential for image processing, and addresses interesting theoretical questions.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60043973","afid":"60043973","affilname":"Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics","affiliation-city":"Minsk","affiliation-country":"Belarus"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56511553600","authid":"56511553600","authname":"Petrovsky N.","surname":"Petrovsky","given-name":"Nick","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60043973"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35265083400","authid":"35265083400","authname":"Stankevich A.","surname":"Stankevich","given-name":"Andrew","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60043973"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25937204400","authid":"25937204400","authname":"Petrovsky A.","surname":"Petrovsky","given-name":"Alexander","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60043973"}]}],"authkeywords":"Hypercomplex numbers | Image coding | Losslessness | Paraunitary fillter bank | Quaternion | Regularity","source-id":"12409","fund-acr":"BRFFR","fund-no":"F12MB-030","fund-sponsor":"Belarusian Republican Foundation for Fundamental Research","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84957850769"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84957850769?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84957850769&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84957850769&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84957850769","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84957850769","eid":"2-s2.0-84957850769","dc:title":"Novel uncertainty principles associated with 2D quaternion Fourier transforms","dc:creator":"Yang Y.","prism:publicationName":"Integral Transforms and Special Functions","prism:issn":"10652469","prism:eIssn":"14768291","prism:volume":"27","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"213-226","prism:coverDate":"2016-03-03","prism:coverDisplayDate":"3 March 2016","prism:doi":"10.1080/10652469.2015.1114482","dc:description":"The quaternion Fourier transform has been widely employed in the colour image processing.

The experiment results show that the proposed method can obtain better visual effect, it is robust enough to rotation attack, meanwhile, it is also robust enough to some mage degradation process such as filtering, JPEG compression and cropping attack.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60089926","afid":"60089926","affilname":"Weinan Teachers University","affiliation-city":"Weinan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/116578696","afid":"116578696","affilname":"Center of X Ray Detection and Application of Shaanxi Province","affiliation-city":"Weinan","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56498362300","authid":"56498362300","authname":"He B.","surname":"He","given-name":"Bing","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60089926"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"116578696"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image | Invariant moments | Quaternion | Radon transform | Zero watermarking","source-id":"29715","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963988900"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963988900?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84963988900&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84963988900&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963988900","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84963988900","eid":"2-s2.0-84963988900","dc:title":"Adaptive Beamforming for Vector-Sensor Arrays Based on a Reweighted Zero-Attracting Quaternion-Valued LMS Algorithm","dc:creator":"Jiang M.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","prism:issn":"15497747","prism:eIssn":"15583791","prism:volume":"63","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"274-278","prism:coverDate":"2016-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"March 2016","prism:doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2015.2482464","dc:description":"In this brief, reference signal-based adaptive beamforming for vector sensor arrays consisting of crossed dipoles is studied.

As a solution, a reweighted zero-attracting quaternion-valued least-mean-square algorithm is proposed.

Moments and moment invariants have become a powerful tool in robust image watermarking owing to their image description capability and geometric invariance property. However, the existing moment-based watermarking schemes were mainly designed for gray images but not for color images, and detection quality and robustness will be lowered when watermark is directly embedded into the luminance component or three color channels of color images. Furthermore, the imperceptibility of the embedded watermark is not well guaranteed. Based on algebra of quaternions and exponent moments theory, a new color image watermarking algorithm robust to geometric distortions is proposed in this paper. We firstly introduce the quaternion exponent moments to deal with the color images in a holistic manner, and it is shown that the quaternion exponent moments can be obtained from the conventional exponent moments of each channel. Then we provide a theoretical framework to construct a set of combined invariants with respect to geometric distortions (rotation, scaling, and translation). And finally, we present a new color image watermarking algorithm robust to geometric distortions, which is based on a set of quaternion exponent moments invariants. Experimental results show that the proposed color image watermarking is not only invisible and robust against common signals processing such as median filter, noise adding, and JPEG compression, but also robust against the geometric distortions.","citedby-count":"14","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017010","afid":"60017010","affilname":"Liaoning Normal University","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972239800","authid":"34972239800","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xiangyang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34972350300","authid":"34972350300","authname":"Yang H.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Hongying","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16205443400","authid":"16205443400","authname":"Niu P.","surname":"Niu","given-name":"Panpan","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55318994100","authid":"55318994100","authname":"Wang C.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Chunpeng","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017010"}]}],"authkeywords":"Algebra of quaternions | Color image watermarking | Exponent moments | Geometric distortions | Quantization","source-id":"26714","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61272416","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962744176"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962744176?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84962744176&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84962744176&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962744176","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84962744176","eid":"2-s2.0-84962744176","dc:title":"The SINS' SRC-KF attitude estimation modeling algorithm","dc:creator":"Ding G.","prism:publicationName":"Wuhan Daxue Xuebao (Xinxi Kexue Ban)/Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University","prism:issn":"16718860","prism:volume":"41","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"367-372","prism:coverDate":"2016-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 March 2016","prism:doi":"10.13203/j.whugis20140115","dc:description":"We propose the spherical-radial cubature integral Kalman filtering (SRC-KF) algorithm based on the high-precision requirements for oSINS' attitude determination on aircraft according to Bayesian optimal estimation theory.

In this work we present a non-trivial generalization of Gabor frames to the quaternionic case and give new density results. The key tool is the two-sided windowed quaternionic Fourier transform (WQFT). As in the complex case, we want to write the WQFT as an inner product between a quaternion-valued signal and shifts and modulates of a real-valued window function. We demonstrate a Heisenberg uncertainty principle and for the results regarding the density, we employ the quaternionic Zak transform to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure that a quaternionic Gabor system is a quaternionic Gabor frame. We conclude with a proof that the Gabor conjecture does not hold true in the quaternionic case.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024825","afid":"60024825","affilname":"Universidade de Aveiro","affiliation-city":"Aveiro","affiliation-country":"Portugal"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56781045600","authid":"56781045600","authname":"Hartmann S.","surname":"Hartmann","given-name":"Stefan","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024825"}]}],"authkeywords":"Critical density | Quaternionic Gabor frames | Quaternionic Zak transform | Windowed quaternionic Fourier transform","source-id":"4900152804","fund-acr":"FCT","fund-no":"UID/MAT/ 0416/2013","fund-sponsor":"Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84958600048"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84958600048?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84958600048&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84958600048&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84958600048","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84958600048","eid":"2-s2.0-84958600048","dc:title":"Tighter Uncertainty Principles Based on Quaternion Fourier Transform","dc:creator":"Yang Y.","prism:publicationName":"Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras","prism:issn":"01887009","prism:eIssn":"16614909","prism:volume":"26","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"479-497","prism:coverDate":"2016-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 March 2016","prism:doi":"10.1007/s00006-015-0579-0","dc:description":"The quaternion Fourier transform (QFT) and its properties are reviewed in this paper.

Consequently, the PH curves admit many exact computations that otherwise require approximations. The Pythagorean structure is achieved by specifying x'(t), y'(t), z'(t) in terms of polynomials u(t),v(t),p(t),q(t) through a construct that can be interpreted as a mapping from R4 to R3 defined by a quaternion product or the Hopf map.

The generation of S(t,ϕ) through a family of four-dimensional rotations of a \"base curve\" is described, and the first fundamental form, Gaussian curvature, total area, and total curvature of S(t,ϕ) are derived. Furthermore, if r'(t) is non-degenerate, S(t,ϕ) is not developable (a non-trivial fact in R4). It is also shown that the pre-images of spatial PH curves equipped with a rotation-minimizing orthonormal frame (comprising the tangent and normal-plane vectors with no instantaneous rotation about the tangent) are geodesics on the surface S(t,ϕ). Finally, a geometrical interpretation of the algebraic condition characterizing the simplest non-trivial instances of rational rotation-minimizing frames on polynomial space curves is derived.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014439","afid":"60014439","affilname":"University of California, Davis","affiliation-city":"Davis","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006823457","authid":"7006823457","authname":"Farouki R.T.","surname":"Farouki","given-name":"Rida T.","initials":"R.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014439"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56579750600","authid":"56579750600","authname":"Gutierrez R.","surname":"Gutierrez","given-name":"Robert","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014439"}]}],"authkeywords":"Four-dimensional geometry | Gaussian curvature | Hopf map | Pythagorean-hodograph curves | Quaternion polynomials | Ringed surfaces | Rotation-minimizing frames","source-id":"28503","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84919372533"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84919372533?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84919372533&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84919372533&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84919372533","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84919372533","eid":"2-s2.0-84919372533","dc:title":"An integrated similarity metric for graph-based color image segmentation","dc:creator":"Li X.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","prism:issn":"13807501","prism:eIssn":"15737721","prism:volume":"75","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"2969-2987","prism:coverDate":"2016-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 March 2016","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11042-014-2416-1","dc:description":"Graph-based method has become one of the major trends in image segmentation. In this paper, we focus on how to build the affinity matrix which is one of the key issues in graph-based color image segmentation. Four different metrics are integrated in order to build an effective affinity matrix for segmentation. First, the quaternion-based color distance is utilized to measure color differences between color pixels and the oversegmented regions (superpixels), which is more accurate than the commonly used Euclidean distance. In order to describe the superpixels well, especially for texture images, we combine the mean and the variance information to represent the superpixels. Then the image boundary information is used to merge the oversegmented regions to preserve the image edge and reduce the computational complexity. An object for recognition may be cut into nonadjacent sub-parts by clutter or shadows, the affinities between adjacent and nonadjacent superpixels are computed in our study. This feature of affinity is not considered in other methods which only consider the similarity of adjacent regions. Experimental results on the Berkeley segmentation dataset (BSDS) and Weizmann segmentation evaluation datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared with some existing popular image segmentation methods.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025761","afid":"60025761","affilname":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Wuhan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001604","afid":"60001604","affilname":"Ministry of Education China","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189218464","authid":"57189218464","authname":"Li X.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Xiang","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001604"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15922652500","authid":"15922652500","authname":"Jin L.","surname":"Jin","given-name":"Lianghai","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001604"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23767272300","authid":"23767272300","authname":"Song E.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Enmin","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001604"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26642874300","authid":"26642874300","authname":"He Z.","surname":"He","given-name":"Zeng","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025761"}]}],"authkeywords":"Graph-based method | Image segmentation | Quaternion | Similarity metrics","source-id":"25627","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61075010","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84969832860"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84969832860?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84969832860&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84969832860&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84969832860","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84969832860","eid":"2-s2.0-84969832860","dc:title":"The modified HR calculus to reproducing kernel hilbert space and the quaternion kernel least mean square algorithm","dc:creator":"Xu W.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - 8th International Conference on Internet Computing for Science and Engineering, ICICSE 2015","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781509004546"}],"prism:pageRange":"50-55","prism:coverDate":"2016-02-29","prism:coverDisplayDate":"29 February 2016","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICICSE.2015.19","dc:description":"Recently, kernel methods for nonlinear processing have been gained widely attention.

We provide a general framework to attack the problem of adaptive filtering of quaternion signals, using both methods. In addition, we modified HR calculus with the concept of inner product in quaternion Hilbert space. The quaternion gradient is provided in quaternion Hilbert spaces.

Saliency detection is a fundamental characteristic of the human visual system. Finding computational models which are able to detect salient regions is a challenging task for image processing and computer vision applications. Salient regions of various sizes can be detected from different scales. Therefore, selecting the best scales is an important issue. In this paper, an efficient multi-scale method to find salient regions is proposed. In order to include more features in evaluating saliency of a pixel, feature maps are generated using components of both the RGB and YUV color spaces. These features are combined into quaternions. Detecting salient regions of different sizes is addressed by utilizing a scale space analysis. Salient regions are detected by convolving the image amplitude spectrum with a low-pass Gaussian kernel of multiple scales. To incorporate more meaningful information, more than one scale is considered based on entropy criterion. The final saliency map is generated by normalizing the weighted saliency maps of these scales. Experiments are conducted on a dataset of natural images to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method provides larger values of area under receiver operating characteristics curve, precision, recall and F-measure, in comparison to some of the state-of-the-art methods.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033154","afid":"60033154","affilname":"Concordia University","affiliation-city":"Montreal","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/48161197300","authid":"48161197300","authname":"Abkenar M.","surname":"Abkenar","given-name":"Masoumeh Rezaei","initials":"M.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033154"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55665250800","authid":"55665250800","authname":"Ahmad M.","surname":"Ahmad","given-name":"M.

In this paper, we propose a novel recognition framework formulti-class RS objects based on the discriminative sparse representation. In this framework, the recognition problem is implemented in two stages. In the first, or discriminative dictionary learning stage, considering the characterization of remote sensing objects, the scale-invariant feature transform descriptor is first combined with an improved bag-of-words model for multi-class objects feature extraction and representation. Then, information about each class of training samples is fused into the dictionary learning process; by using the K-singular value decomposition algorithm, a discriminative dictionary can be learned for sparse coding. In the second, or recognition, stage, to improve the computational efficiency, the phase spectrum of a quaternion Fourier transform model is applied to the test image to predict a small set of object candidate locations. Then, a multi-scale sliding window mechanism is utilized to scan the image over those candidate locations to obtain the object candidates (or objects of interest). Subsequently, the sparse coding coefficients of these candidates under the discriminative dictionary are mapped to the discriminative vectors that have a good ability to distinguish different classes of objects. Finally, multi-class object recognition can be accomplished by analyzing these vectors. The experimental results show that the proposed work outperforms a number of state-of-the-art methods for multi-class remote sensing object recognition.","citedby-count":"35","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020258","afid":"60020258","affilname":"Nanjing Normal University","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010851","afid":"60010851","affilname":"Hohai University","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55983785200","authid":"55983785200","authname":"Wang X.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Xin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010851"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56673329200","authid":"56673329200","authname":"Shen S.","surname":"Shen","given-name":"Siqiu","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010851"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56104331000","authid":"56104331000","authname":"Ning C.","surname":"Ning","given-name":"Chen","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020258"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12798269500","authid":"12798269500","authname":"Huang F.","surname":"Huang","given-name":"Fengchen","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010851"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34770690700","authid":"34770690700","authname":"Gao H.","surname":"Gao","given-name":"Hongmin","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010851"}]}],"source-id":"29593","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61271386","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84969642537"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84969642537?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84969642537&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84969642537&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84969642537","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84969642537","eid":"2-s2.0-84969642537","dc:title":"Automated ball tracking in tennis videos","dc:creator":"Qazi T.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of 2015 3rd International Conference on Image Information Processing, ICIIP 2015","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781509001484"}],"prism:pageRange":"236-240","prism:coverDate":"2016-02-19","prism:coverDisplayDate":"19 February 2016","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICIIP.2015.7414772","dc:description":"Sports video analysis tools are gaining enormous popularity as they enable enhanced visualization and analysis of the game. An intriguing problem is localizing and tracking the ball in a game of tennis. However, achieving a practically suitable tradeoff between high detection accuracy and speed of the ball is a challenging problem in automatic ball tracking algorithms. In this paper, we propose a machine learning based automated ball tracking algorithm in tennis match videos acquired by a camera mounted on a quadcopter. We begin with applying a video stabilization technique followed by random forest segmentation for detecting tennis ball candidates in the video frames. The yellow color plane intensity and Phase Quaternion Fourier Transform (PQFT) saliency are used as features for random forest segmentation. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on datasets from real-world tennis videos. The experimental results show that our algorithm is robust and achieves 94% accuracy in best case and successfully detects the ball even in cases of partial occlusion by net or racket.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60113155","afid":"60113155","affilname":"Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women","affiliation-city":"New Delhi","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032730","afid":"60032730","affilname":"Indian Institute of Technology Delhi","affiliation-city":"New Delhi","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189351655","authid":"57189351655","authname":"Qazi T.","surname":"Qazi","given-name":"Tayeba","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60113155"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57044104800","authid":"57044104800","authname":"Mukherjee P.","surname":"Mukherjee","given-name":"Prerana","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032730"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57844854200","authid":"57844854200","authname":"Srivastava S.","surname":"Srivastava","given-name":"Siddharth","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032730"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003946630","authid":"7003946630","authname":"Lall B.","surname":"Lall","given-name":"Brejesh","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032730"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189354517","authid":"57189354517","authname":"Chauhan N.R.","surname":"Chauhan","given-name":"Nathi Ram","initials":"N.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60113155"}]}],"authkeywords":"Ball Tracking | Random Forest Segmentation | Tennis video | Video Stabilization","article-number":"7414772","source-id":"21100462827","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
