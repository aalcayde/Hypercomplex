Firstly, based on the augmented quaternion, the proposed algorithm uses the noncircular characteristic of the signals to achieve the virtual array expansion; secondly, the DOA and range parameters can be completely separated in the principle of rank reduction, and finally, the parameters of DOA and range are estimated through one dimensional search. Compared with direct mutil-dimensional (M-D) searching algorithms, the proposed method merely requires several one-dimension (1-D) spectral peak search which does not need parameter pairing. Simulation results verify the performance promotion of the proposed approach.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031419","afid":"60031419","affilname":"Ningbo University","affiliation-city":"Ningbo","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/120817950","afid":"120817950","affilname":"Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Advanced Control of State Ethnic Affairs Commission","affiliation-city":"Dalian","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219005346","authid":"57219005346","orcid":"0000-0002-3161-1002","authname":"Zhao T.","surname":"Zhao","given-name":"Tianyi","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031419"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216398555","authid":"57216398555","orcid":"0000-0001-7156-1639","authname":"Zhang Z.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Zehao","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031419"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57141118300","authid":"57141118300","orcid":"0000-0002-2918-8735","authname":"Chen H.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Hua","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031419"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"120817950"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57220181191","authid":"57220181191","orcid":"0000-0002-0975-6395","authname":"Qi L.","surname":"Qi","given-name":"Lin","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031419"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16319185100","authid":"16319185100","orcid":"0000-0003-3879-6094","authname":"Liu W.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Weiyue","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031419"}]}],"authkeywords":"COLD array | near-field source | noncircular signals | Quaternion","article-number":"9266761","source-id":"21100374601","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"IF2020112","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85097144647"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85097144647?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85097144647&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85097144647&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85097144647","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85097144647","eid":"2-s2.0-85097144647","dc:title":"Quaternion Neural Networks: State-of-the-Art and Research Challenges","dc:creator":"García-Retuerta D.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783030623647"}],"prism:volume":"12490 LNCS","prism:pageRange":"456-467","prism:coverDate":"2020-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2020","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-62365-4_43","dc:description":"Machine Learning has recently emerged as a new paradigm for processing all types of information.

We designed and trained two neural networks to achieve reliable 6D object pose estimation on such images. The first neural network detects fiducial points of objects, which are then fed to a PnP algorithm responsible for pose estimation. The second one is an rotation regression network delivering at the output the quaternion. The neural networks were trained on our datasets containing both real images as well as photo-realistic images, which have been rendered on the basis of our 3D models. The performance of neural networks for object segmentation and 6D pose estimation was evaluated using both real and synthesized images. Experimental results demonstrate a high potential of our approach to pose estimation of texture-less objects observed by RGB camera and mounted on arm of the Franka-Emika robot.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017351","afid":"60017351","affilname":"AGH University of Krakow","affiliation-city":"Krakow","affiliation-country":"Poland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57220032042","authid":"57220032042","authname":"Lopatin V.","surname":"Lopatin","given-name":"Vladyslav","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017351"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55948049900","authid":"55948049900","authname":"Kwolek B.","surname":"Kwolek","given-name":"Bogdan","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017351"}]}],"authkeywords":"6D object pose estimation | Convolutional neural networks | Robotics","source-id":"25674","fund-acr":"NCN","fund-no":"2017/27/B/ST6/01743","fund-sponsor":"Narodowe Centrum Nauki","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85096535538"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85096535538?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85096535538&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85096535538&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85096535538","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85096535538","eid":"2-s2.0-85096535538","dc:title":"Surface Fitting Using Dual Quaternion Control Points with Applications in Human Respiratory Modelling","dc:creator":"Grafton A.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783030618636"}],"prism:volume":"12221 LNCS","prism:pageRange":"421-433","prism:coverDate":"2020-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2020","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-61864-3_36","dc:description":"In this paper we present a method for representing surfaces using a set of dual quaternion control points, with the goal of fitting to point clouds. Each control point is defined by a position and radius, which specify the area of the surface it affects, and a dual quaternion defining the transformation it applies. A point is mapped using the surface by a weighted sum of the control points, in a similar method to dual quaternion skinning. A surface is then represented as the transformation of an original surface, such as a unit square plane, using the control points. We demonstrate how we may fit surfaces to point clouds using a modified iterative gradient descent algorithm, adding control points to regions of the surface that are most poorly modelled at the current step. These methods are applied to the problem of representing human breathing by fitting surfaces to a subject’s chest as recorded by an RGB-D (image plus depth) camera and parameterizing the breathing using each control point’s parameters. Variations in the breathing pattern are shown before and after exercise.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031101","afid":"60031101","affilname":"University of Cambridge","affiliation-city":"Cambridge","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57220043671","authid":"57220043671","orcid":"0000-0003-1613-9683","authname":"Grafton A.","surname":"Grafton","given-name":"Alex","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031101"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701831900","authid":"6701831900","orcid":"0000-0002-0571-0218","authname":"Lasenby J.","surname":"Lasenby","given-name":"Joan","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031101"}]}],"authkeywords":"Clifford algebra | Dual quaternions | Respiration | Surface modelling","source-id":"25674","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85096403396"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85096403396?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85096403396&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85096403396&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85096403396","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85096403396","eid":"2-s2.0-85096403396","dc:title":"Mobile Multimedia/Image Processing, Security, and Applications 2020","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","prism:issn":"0277786X","prism:eIssn":"1996756X","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781510635753"}],"prism:volume":"11399","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2020","dc:description":"The proceedings contain 24 papers.

Recently several image segmentations tools have been developed. However, these tools have limitations and sometimes not aureate since the capture devices usually generate low-resolution images, which are mostly noise and blurry. The goal of this study are: (1) To map optimally images into color images to enhance their contrast and the visibility of otherwise obscured details; (2) To perform an automated segmentation analysis using modified Chan and Vese method; and (3) To study the impact of the segmentation evaluation method. Computer simulations on the thermal dataset show that the new segmentation algorithm exhibits better results compared to state-of-the-art techniques.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018011","afid":"60018011","affilname":"Donskoj Gosudarstvennyj Tehniceskij Universitet","affiliation-city":"Rostov-on-Don","affiliation-country":"Russian Federation"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014196","afid":"60014196","affilname":"Moscow State Technological University Stankin","affiliation-city":"Moscow","affiliation-country":"Russian Federation"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007033","afid":"60007033","affilname":"City University of New York","affiliation-city":"New York","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55802371401","authid":"55802371401","authname":"Voronin V.","surname":"Voronin","given-name":"V.","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014196"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018011"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56572834900","authid":"56572834900","authname":"Semenishchev E.","surname":"Semenishchev","given-name":"E.","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014196"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204649388","authid":"57204649388","authname":"Zelensky A.","surname":"Zelensky","given-name":"A.","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014196"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57197804464","authid":"57197804464","authname":"Tokareva O.","surname":"Tokareva","given-name":"O.","initials":"O.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018011"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35321805400","authid":"35321805400","authname":"Agaian S.","surname":"Agaian","given-name":"S.","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007033"}]}],"authkeywords":"Image enhancement | Image segmentation | Quaternion | Remote sensing","article-number":"113990G","source-id":"40067","fund-acr":"Minobrnauka","fund-no":"No075-03-2020-079/2","fund-sponsor":"Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85096361627"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85096361627?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85096361627&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85096361627&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85096361627","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85096361627","eid":"2-s2.0-85096361627","dc:title":"Thermal and night vision image visibility and enhancement","dc:creator":"Grigoryan A.M.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","prism:issn":"0277786X","prism:eIssn":"1996756X","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781510635753"}],"prism:volume":"11399","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2020","prism:doi":"10.1117/12.2558724","dc:description":"This paper offers a review of effective methods of image representation, or visibility images in enhancement applied to the thermal images and night vision images.

The concept of quaternion two-qubit is considered and applied for image representation in each quantum pixel. The colors at each pixel are processed as one unit in quaternion representation. Other new models for quaternion image representation are also described. It is shown that a quaternion image or a four component image of N × M pixels, can be represented by (r + s + 2) qubits, when N = 2r and M = 2s, r, s > 1. The number of qubits for representing the image can be reduced to (r + s), when using the quaternion 2-qubit concept.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007033","afid":"60007033","affilname":"City University of New York","affiliation-city":"New York","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003212","afid":"60003212","affilname":"The University of Texas at San Antonio","affiliation-city":"San Antonio","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006123399","authid":"7006123399","authname":"Grigoryan A.M.","surname":"Grigoryan","given-name":"Artyom M.","initials":"A.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003212"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003395533","authid":"7003395533","authname":"Agaian S.S.","surname":"Agaian","given-name":"Sos S.","initials":"S.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007033"}]}],"authkeywords":"Image color analysis | Quantum computing | Quaternion image | Qubit image representation","article-number":"113990O","source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85096359804"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85096359804?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85096359804&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85096359804&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85096359804","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85096359804","eid":"2-s2.0-85096359804","dc:title":"Quaternion based neural network for hyperspectral image classification","dc:creator":"Rao S.P.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","prism:issn":"0277786X","prism:eIssn":"1996756X","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781510635753"}],"prism:volume":"11399","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2020","prism:doi":"10.1117/12.2558808","dc:description":"Neural networks have emerged to be the most appropriate method for tackling the classification problem for hyperspectral images (HIS). Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), being the current state-of-art for various classification tasks, have some limitations in the context of HSI. These CNN models are very susceptible to overfitting because of 1) lack of availability of training samples, 2) large number of parameters to fine-tune. Furthermore, the learning rates used by CNN must be small to avoid vanishing gradients, and thus the gradient descent takes small steps to converge and slows down the model runtime. To overcome these drawbacks, a novel quaternion based hyperspectral image classification network (QHIC Net) is proposed in this paper. The QHIC Net can model both the local dependencies between the spectral channels of a single-pixel and the global structural relationship describing the edges or shapes formed by a group of pixels, making it suitable for HSI datasets that are small and diverse. Experimental results on three HSI datasets demonstrate that the QHIC Net performs on par with the traditional CNN based methods for HSI Classification with a far fewer number of parameters.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023143","afid":"60023143","affilname":"Tufts University","affiliation-city":"Medford","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007033","afid":"60007033","affilname":"City University of New York","affiliation-city":"New York","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191541404","authid":"57191541404","authname":"Rao S.P.","surname":"Rao","given-name":"Shishir Paramathma","initials":"S.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6507727793","authid":"6507727793","authname":"Panetta K.","surname":"Panetta","given-name":"Karen","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023143"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35321805400","authid":"35321805400","authname":"Agaian S.","surname":"Agaian","given-name":"Sos","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007033"}]}],"authkeywords":"Classification | Deep learning | Hyperspectral imaging | Spectral-spatial feature learning","article-number":"113990S","source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85096358942"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85096358942?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85096358942&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85096358942&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85096358942","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85096358942","eid":"2-s2.0-85096358942","dc:title":"Theoretical analysis of quaternion image matching performance","dc:creator":"DelMarco S.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","prism:issn":"0277786X","prism:eIssn":"1996756X","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781510635753"}],"prism:volume":"11399","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2020","prism:doi":"10.1117/12.2558728","dc:description":"Recently, quaternions have been applied to multi-channel image processing such as color image registration, edge detection, and image matching. The general approach consists of using up to four image components as separate components in a quaternion-valued image. Techniques from quaternion algebra and analysis, such as quaternion Fourier transforms and correlation, are exploited to implement the desired image processing operations. The motivation underlying use of quaternions involves the concept of holistic data processing. That is, information in separate channels is processed jointly, thereby leveraging correlations across channel. Furthermore, quaternion transforms, such as the Fourier and wavelet transforms, have been defined and can be applied to process quaternion-valued imagery. For example, analogues from classical signal processing, such as the convolution theorem, have been derived and can be used to reduce computational burden. Such quaternion-based image processing techniques can provide performance superior to classical approaches which process image components independently. However, under certain conditions, performance of quaternion-based methods fails to meet performance of independent channel processing methods. In this paper, we perform a theoretical analysis of the performance of quaternion image matching. We present conditions under which quaternion-based processing outperforms, or falls short of, independent channel processing methods. We produce numerical image matching results validating the theoretical performance analysis using synthetic data. We define and solve a linear system of equations to generate the synthetic data. Receiver Operating Characteristics curves are provided to demonstrate the improved performance of the quaternion image matching approach under the favorable conditions predicted by the theory.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017016","afid":"60017016","affilname":"BAE Systems Inc.","affiliation-city":"Arlington","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8835566600","authid":"8835566600","authname":"DelMarco S.","surname":"DelMarco","given-name":"Stephen","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017016"}]}],"authkeywords":"Correlation | Hypercomplex | Image matching | Multi-channel | Quaternions","article-number":"1139908","source-id":"40067","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85096357590"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85096357590?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85096357590&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85096357590&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85096357590","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85096357590","eid":"2-s2.0-85096357590","dc:title":"Optimal restoration of multiple signals in quaternion algebra","dc:creator":"Grigoryan A.M.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","prism:issn":"0277786X","prism:eIssn":"1996756X","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781510635753"}],"prism:volume":"11399","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2020","prism:doi":"10.1117/12.2558209","dc:description":"This paper offers a new multiple signal restoration tool to solve the inverse problem, when signals are convoluted with a multiple impulse response and then degraded by an additive noise signal with multiple components. Inverse problems arise practically in all areas of science and engineering and refers to as methods of estimating data/parameters, in our case of multiple signals that cannot directly be observed. The presented tool is based on the mapping multiple signals into the quaternion domain, and then solving the inverse problem. Due to the non-commutativity of quaternion arithmetic, it is difficult to find the optimal filter in the frequency domain for degraded quaternion signals. As an alternative, we introduce an optimal filter by using special 4×4 matrices on the discrete Fourier transforms of signal components, at each frequency-point. The optimality of the solution is with respect to the mean-square-root error, as in the classical theory of the signal restoration by the Wiener filter. The Illustrative example of optimal filtration of multiple degraded signals in the quaternion domain is given.

Applications to image processing include color image registration, edge detection, filtering, and color space correction, and multi-channel image matching. These techniques represent multiple image channels, such as three color channels, as image functions taking values in a finite-dimensional algebra, for example, the algebra of quaternions. Use of these algebras enables processing a multichannel image as a single entity, holistically. This holistic processing provides the opportunity to exploit cross-channel dependencies for improved performance, for example, improved matching performance in image matching or registration applications. In this paper, we make a critical analysis of the foundations of quaternion-valued image matching. We investigate standard alternatives to using quaternions for four-channel image matching including image tiling, image averaging, independent component processing, and coordinated component translation approaches. We examine the advantages that quaternion-based processing provides over these alternatives. We interpret the quaternion match metric as an inner product, which provides motivation for image matching using quaternion correlation.

For 3-D scene reconstruction, one approach is to employ multiple cameras for creating a multiview image with the aim to make interactive free-viewpoint selection possible in 3-D data. In most cases, such a 3-D scene contains missing holes on depth maps that appear during the synthesis from multi-views. This paper presents an automated pipeline for processing multi-view satellite images to 3-D digital surface models. The proposed approach uses the modified exemplar-based technique. We propose an algorithm using the concepts of a sparse representation of quaternions, which use a new gradient to calculate the priority function by integrating the structure of quaternions with LPA-ICI (local polynomial approximation - the intersection of confidence intervals) and the saliency map. Moreover, the color information incorporates into the optimization criteria to obtain sharp inpainting results. For this purpose, we use the Hamiltonian quaternion framework. Compared with state-of-the-art techniques, the proposed algorithm provides plausible restoration of the depth map from multi-view satellite images, which makes them a promising tool for surveillance applications.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022381","afid":"60022381","affilname":"Beijing Jiaotong University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018011","afid":"60018011","affilname":"Donskoj Gosudarstvennyj Tehniceskij Universitet","affiliation-city":"Rostov-on-Don","affiliation-country":"Russian Federation"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014196","afid":"60014196","affilname":"Moscow State Technological University Stankin","affiliation-city":"Moscow","affiliation-country":"Russian Federation"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55802371401","authid":"55802371401","authname":"Voronin V.","surname":"Voronin","given-name":"V.","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014196"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56157301500","authid":"56157301500","authname":"Gapon N.","surname":"Gapon","given-name":"N.","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018011"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219971735","authid":"57219971735","authname":"Zhdanova M.","surname":"Zhdanova","given-name":"M.","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014196"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56572834900","authid":"56572834900","authname":"Semenishchev E.","surname":"Semenishchev","given-name":"E.","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014196"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57215374719","authid":"57215374719","authname":"Cen Y.","surname":"Cen","given-name":"Y.","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022381"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204649388","authid":"57204649388","authname":"Zelensky A.","surname":"Zelensky","given-name":"A.","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014196"}]}],"authkeywords":"3-D reconstruction | Depth map reconstruction | Gradient | Inpainting | Satellite Images | Surveillance","article-number":"115420P","source-id":"40067","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"20-57-53012","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85096354253"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85096354253?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85096354253&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85096354253&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85096354253","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85096354253","eid":"2-s2.0-85096354253","dc:title":"Image enhancement in a quaternion framework for remote sensing applications","dc:creator":"Voronin V.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","prism:issn":"0277786X","prism:eIssn":"1996756X","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781510638990"}],"prism:volume":"11543","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2020","prism:doi":"10.1117/12.2574242","dc:description":"Image enhancement refers to processing images to make them more suitable for display or further image analysis.

Through experiments on aerial photographic camera that was taken almost vertically, it was possible to determine the exterior orientation parameters using three ground control points, but the Procrustes algorithm was sensitive to the configuration of the ground control points. Even in experiments with a close-range amateur camera where the attitude angles of the camera change significantly, the algorithm was sensitive to the configuration of the ground control points, and the other algorithms required at least six ground control points.

Recently, low-rank quaternion matrix completion (LRQMC) methods have proven very useful for color image inpainting. In this article, we propose three novel LRQMC methods based on three quaternion-based bilinear factor (QBF) matrix norm minimization models. Specifically, we define quaternion double Frobenius norm (Q-DFN), quaternion double nuclear norm (Q-DNN), and quaternion Frobenius/nuclear norm (Q-FNN), and then show their relationship with quaternion-based matrix Schatten-p (Q-Schatten-p) norm for certain p values. The proposed methods can avoid computing quaternion singular value decompositions (QSVD) for large quaternion matrices, and thus can effectively reduce the calculation time compared with existing (LRQMC) methods. Furthermore, we also analyze the convergence of the algorithms, and introduce a rank estimation method for the quaternion matrix. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods over some state-of-the-art low-rank (quaternion) matrix completion methods.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201452670","authid":"57201452670","orcid":"0000-0001-5663-8749","authname":"Miao J.","surname":"Miao","given-name":"Jifei","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003837546","authid":"7003837546","orcid":"0000-0003-1924-9087","authname":"Kou K.I.","surname":"Kou","given-name":"Kit Ian","initials":"K.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]}],"authkeywords":"Bilinear factor matrix norm | color image inpainting | low-rank | quaternion matrix completion","article-number":"9204671","source-id":"17391","fund-acr":"STDF","fund-no":"FDCT/085/2018/A2","fund-sponsor":"Science and Technology Development Fund","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85091769935"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85091769935?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85091769935&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85091769935&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85091769935","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85091769935","eid":"2-s2.0-85091769935","dc:title":"Local rotation pattern: A local descriptor of color textures","dc:creator":"Jebali H.","prism:publicationName":"ICSOFT 2020 - Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Software Technologies","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789897584435"}],"prism:pageRange":"567-573","prism:coverDate":"2020-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2020","dc:description":"Describing color textures is an extremely challenging problem in pattern recognition and computer vision. In this paper, a new texture feature is proposed and investigated for color texture image classification. Based on quaternion representation of color images and quaternion rotation, a Local Rotation Pattern descriptor (LRP) is proposed. Using quaternion to represent color images is done by encoding the three RGB channels into the three imaginary parts of a quaternion. The distance between two color can be expressed as the angle of rotation between two unit quaternions using the geodesic distance to obtain finally our LRP histograms. Performance in texture classification is assessed for three challenging datasets: Vistex, Outex-TC13 and USPtex databases facing to the recent results from the state-of-the-art.

However, it is well known that GPS signals are weakened or blocked in tunnels, urban canyons, or indoor environments. A solution is to use multiple IMU(Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors. In this paper, we present a federated fusion algorithm for GPS-free localization using multiple MEMS IMUs. The federated filter uses a master fusion algorithm to combine the outputs of independent sensors so that the current position can be estimated. The proposed structure exploits a quaternion-based extended Kalman filter and a linear Kalman filter for attitude estimations and velocity estimations, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was demonstrated with MATLAB simulation.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012704","afid":"60012704","affilname":"Kyungpook National University","affiliation-city":"Daegu","affiliation-country":"South Korea"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55085902200","authid":"55085902200","orcid":"0000-0002-5560-3664","authname":"Kim J.","surname":"Kim","given-name":"Jiyeon","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012704"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25930551000","authid":"25930551000","orcid":"0000-0002-5917-3921","authname":"Song M.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Moogeun","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012704"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202767865","authid":"57202767865","orcid":"0000-0001-7033-4258","authname":"Kim J.","surname":"Kim","given-name":"Jaehoon","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012704"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55698910600","authid":"55698910600","orcid":"0000-0003-2689-9846","authname":"Lee D.","surname":"Lee","given-name":"Dongik","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012704"}]}],"authkeywords":"Extended Kalman filter | Federated filter | Multiple IMUs | Position estimation | Quaternion","source-id":"21100201073","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85091322424"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85091322424?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85091322424&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85091322424&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85091322424","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85091322424","eid":"2-s2.0-85091322424","dc:title":"Banknote Classification Based on Convolutional Neural Network in Quaternion Wavelet Domain","dc:creator":"Huang X.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Access","prism:eIssn":"21693536","prism:volume":"8","prism:pageRange":"162141-162148","prism:coverDate":"2020-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2020","prism:doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3021181","dc:description":"In this paper, we propose a new framework for banknote classification based on quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) and deep convolutional neural network.

Then we design a deep convolutional neural network which is trained on banknote images along with the magnitude and phase of quaternion wavelet coefficients. We assign the neural weights on the output probabilities of deep convolutional neural network and update these weights by utilizing the back propagation algorithm. Finally, the trained networks with decision of a weighted sum and the magnitude and the phase of quaternion wavelet networks are utilized for banknote image classification. The performance of our algorithm is experimentally verified on a variety of banknote databases. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance compared with other state-of-the-art banknote classification algorithms.

Image watermarking is an important method for copyright protection. Considering that color images dominate the real-world image data, designing copyright protection techniques specially for color images are very meaningful. In this paper, we propose a robust blind watermarking scheme for color images based on quaternion Fourier transform (QFT). After converting the color image data into QFT coefficients, we embed the watermark message into the four channels in QFT domain, to improve the embedding capacity and robustness. We also conduct experiment to investigate the performance of visual quality and robustness, by comparing with some other common signal transforms. The experimental results show that our scheme achieves a satisfactory performance.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021182","afid":"60021182","affilname":"Sun Yat-Sen University","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219115098","authid":"57219115098","authname":"Liang R.","surname":"Liang","given-name":"Renjie","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021182"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54793734200","authid":"54793734200","authname":"Zheng P.","surname":"Zheng","given-name":"Peijia","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021182"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403457875","authid":"7403457875","authname":"Fang Y.","surname":"Fang","given-name":"Yanmei","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021182"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216287593","authid":"57216287593","authname":"Song T.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Tingting","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021182"}]}],"authkeywords":"Blind watermarking | Color image watermarking | Quaternion Fourier transform | Robust watermarking","source-id":"25674","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61502547","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85091233649"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85091233649?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85091233649&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85091233649&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85091233649","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85091233649","eid":"2-s2.0-85091233649","dc:title":"Bohr theorems for slice regular functions over octonions","dc:creator":"Xu Z.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh Section A: Mathematics","prism:issn":"03082105","prism:eIssn":"14737124","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2020-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2020","prism:doi":"10.1017/prm.2020.74","dc:description":"In this paper, we mainly investigate two versions of the Bohr theorem for slice regular functions over the largest alternative division algebras of octonions O.

GA unifies and generalizes real numbers and complex, quaternion, and vector algebra, and converts complicated relations and operations into intuitive algebra independent of coordinate systems. It also provides a solution for solving multidimensional information processing with a high correlation among the dimensions and avoids the loss of information. Traditional methods of computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) provide robust results in multidimensional processing after being combined with GA and give additional feature analysis facility to remote sensing images. In this paper, we provide a detailed review of GA in different fields of AI and computer vision regarding its applications and the current developments in geospatial research. We also discuss the Clifford-Fourier transform (CFT) and quaternions (sub-algebra of GA) because of their necessity in remote sensing image processing. We focus on how GA helps AI and solves classification problems, as well as improving these methods using geometric algebra processing.

be a polynomial in several non-commuting variables with coefficients in a field K of arbitrary characteristic. It has been conjectured that for any n, for p multilinear, the image of p evaluated on the set Mn(K) of n by n matrices is either zero, or the set of scalar matrices, or the set sln(K) of matrices of trace 0, or all of Mn(K). This expository paper describes research on this problem and related areas. We discuss the solution of this conjecture for n = 2 in Section 2, some decisive results for n = 3 in Section 3, and partial information for n ≥ 3 in Section 4, also for non-multilinear polynomials. In addition we consider the case of K not algebraically closed, and polynomials evaluated on other finite dimensional simple algebras (in particular the algebra of the quaternions). This review recollects results and technical material of our previous papers, as well as new results of other researches, and applies them in a new context. This article also explains the role of the Deligne trick, which is related to some nonassociative cases in new situations, underlying our earlier, more straightforward approach. We pose some problems for future generalizations and point out possible generalizations in the present state of art, and in the other hand providing counterexamples showing the boundaries of generalizations.","citedby-count":"28","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60080064","afid":"60080064","affilname":"Ariel University","affiliation-city":"Ariel","affiliation-country":"Israel"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002765","afid":"60002765","affilname":"Bar-Ilan University","affiliation-city":"Ramat Gan","affiliation-country":"Israel"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57217180353","authid":"57217180353","authname":"Kanel-Belov A.","surname":"Kanel-Belov","given-name":"Alexei","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002765"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15750889700","authid":"15750889700","authname":"Malev S.","surname":"Malev","given-name":"Sergey","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60080064"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004189683","authid":"7004189683","authname":"Rowen L.","surname":"Rowen","given-name":"Louis","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002765"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55960217000","authid":"55960217000","authname":"Yavich R.","surname":"Yavich","given-name":"Roman","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60080064"}]}],"authkeywords":"L’vov–Kaplansky conjecture | Multilinear polynomial evaluations | Noncommutative polynomials | PI algebras | Power central polynomials | The Deligne trick","article-number":"071","source-id":"11700154503","fund-acr":"ISF","fund-no":"63412","fund-sponsor":"Israel Science Foundation","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089394976"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089394976?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85089394976&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85089394976&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089394976","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85089394976","eid":"2-s2.0-85089394976","dc:title":"On geometric applications of quaternions","dc:creator":"Bektaş DemIrcI B.","prism:publicationName":"Turkish Journal of Mathematics","prism:issn":"13000098","prism:eIssn":"13036149","prism:volume":"44","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"1289-1303","prism:coverDate":"2020-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2020","prism:doi":"10.3906/MAT-1907-120","dc:description":"Quaternions have become a popular and powerful tool in various engineering fields, such as robotics, image and signal processing, and computer graphics. However, classical quaternions are mostly used as a representation of rotation of a vector in 3-dimensions, and connection between its geometric interpretation and algebraic structures is still not well-developed and needs more improvements. In this study, we develop an approach to understand quaternions multiplication defining subspaces of quaternion H, called as Plane(N) and Line(N), and then, we observe the effects of sandwiching maps on the elements of these subspaces. Finally, we give representations of some transformations in geometry using quaternion.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60106420","afid":"60106420","affilname":"Fatih Sultan Mehmet Vakıf Üniversitesi","affiliation-city":"Istanbul","affiliation-country":"Turkey"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216038904","authid":"57216038904","orcid":"0000-0002-5611-5478","authname":"Bektaş DemIrcI B.","surname":"Bektaş DemIrcI","given-name":"Burcu","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60106420"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57218511472","authid":"57218511472","orcid":"0000-0002-6466-4274","authname":"Aghayev N.","surname":"Aghayev","given-name":"Nazim","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60106420"}]}],"authkeywords":"Involution and antiinvolution | Orthogonal projection | Quaternions | Reflection | Sandwiching maps","source-id":"27428","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfree2read"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Bronze"},{"$" :"Green"}]}}]}}
