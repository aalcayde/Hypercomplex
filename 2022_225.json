Image distortion, parallax and object deformation may cause the pixel coordinates of feature matches to have non-rigid deformations, which cannot be represented using a single analytical rigid transformation. To solve this problem, we propose an algorithm based on the re-weighting and 1-point RANSAC strategy (R1P-RNSC), which operates under the assumption that a non-rigid deformation can be approximately represented by multiple rigid transformations. R1P-RNSC is fast but suffers from the drawback that local smoothing information cannot be considered, thus limiting its accuracy. To solve this problem, we propose a non-parametric algorithm based on the expectation-maximization algorithm and the dual quaternion-based representation (EMDQ). EMDQ generates dense and smooth deformation fields by interpolating among the feature matches, simultaneously removing mismatches that are inconsistent with the deformation field. It relies on the rigid transformations obtained by R1P-RNSC to improve its accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that EMDQ has superior accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art mismatch removal methods. The ability to build correspondences for all image pixels using the dense deformation field is another contribution of this paper.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002746","afid":"60002746","affilname":"Harvard Medical School","affiliation-city":"Boston","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"pubmed-id":"34914589","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55365601600","authid":"55365601600","orcid":"0000-0002-1334-8060","authname":"Zhou H.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Haoyin","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002746"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15725486800","authid":"15725486800","orcid":"0000-0002-3308-3012","authname":"Jayender J.","surname":"Jayender","given-name":"Jagadeesan","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002746"}]}],"authkeywords":"Deformation field | Feature matching | Mismatch removal","source-id":"25534","fund-acr":"NIH","fund-no":"K99EB027177","fund-sponsor":"National Institutes of Health","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85121748254"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85121748254?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85121748254&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85121748254&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85121748254","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85121748254","eid":"2-s2.0-85121748254","dc:title":"Crossroads and quaternions: possibilities of digital platforms for the study of miscellaneous and composite codices","dc:creator":"Westerby M.J.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Medieval Iberian Studies","prism:issn":"17546559","prism:eIssn":"17546567","prism:volume":"14","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"166-179","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1080/17546559.2021.2015077","dc:description":"Codex miscellanies are enigmatic witnesses to the intellectual and cultural exchanges of the Middle Ages, both within the Iberian Peninsula and across the Pyrenees.

The practice of isolating these texts and images, as well as its intellectual motivations, has served to obscure our view of manuscript miscellanies and composites as material objects.

In this paper, we propose a novel low-rank quaternion matrix completion algorithm to recover missing data of a color image. Motivated by two kinds of low-rank approximation approaches (low-rank decomposition and nuclear norm minimization) in traditional matrix-based methods, we combine the two approaches in our quaternion matrix-based model. Furthermore, the nuclear norm of the quaternion matrix is replaced by the sum of the Frobenius norm of its two low-rank factor quaternion matrices. Based on the relationship between the quaternion matrix and its equivalent complex matrix, the problem eventually is converted from the quaternion number domain to the complex number domain. An alternating minimization method is applied to solve the model. Simulation results on color image recovery show the superior performance and efficiency of the proposed algorithm over some tensor-based and quaternion-based ones.","citedby-count":"15","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"}],"pubmed-id":"34807825","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201452670","authid":"57201452670","orcid":"0000-0001-5663-8749","authname":"Miao J.","surname":"Miao","given-name":"Jifei","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003837546","authid":"7003837546","orcid":"0000-0003-1924-9087","authname":"Kou K.I.","surname":"Kou","given-name":"Kit Ian","initials":"K.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image recovery | low-rank decomposition | matrix completion | quaternion","source-id":"25534","fund-acr":"FDCT","fund-no":"FDCT/085/2018/A2","fund-sponsor":"Fundo para o Desenvolvimento das Ciências e da Tecnologia","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85120887607"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85120887607?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85120887607&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85120887607&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85120887607","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85120887607","eid":"2-s2.0-85120887607","dc:title":"A zero-watermark scheme based on quaternion generalized fourier descriptor for multiple images","dc:creator":"Wang B.","prism:publicationName":"Computers, Materials and Continua","prism:issn":"15462218","prism:eIssn":"15462226","prism:volume":"71","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"2633-2652","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.32604/cmc.2022.022291","dc:description":"Most of the existing zero-watermark schemes for medical images are only appropriate for a single grayscale image. When they protect a large number of medical images, repeating operations will cause a significant amount of time and storage costs. Hence, this paper proposes an efficient zero-watermark scheme for multiple color medical images based on quaternion generalized Fourier descriptor (QGFD). Firstly, QGFD is utilized to compute the feature invariants of each color image, then the representative features of each image are selected, stacked, and reshaped to generate a feature matrix, which is then binarized to get a binary feature image. Copyright information can be converted into the copyright image by using QR code technology, which contains more information. Finally, the zero-watermark image is constructed by executing the XOR operation on the copyright image and the feature image scrambled by the Cat map. In the experiment, different parameters are selected to determine the maximum number of images that the proposed scheme can protect simultaneously while achieving good robustness.

It inflames air sacs in lungs which fill with fluid which further leads to problems in respiration. Pneumonia is interpreted by radiologists by observing abnormality in lungs in case of fluid in Chest X-Rays. Computer Aided Detection Diagnosis (CAD) tools can assist radiologists by improving their diagnostic accuracy. Such CAD tools use neural networks which are trained on Chest X-Ray dataset to classify a Chest X-Ray into normal or infected with Pneumonia. Convolution neural networks have shown remarkable performance in object detection in an image. Quaternion Convolution neural network (QCNN) is a generalization of conventional convolution neural networks. QCNN treats all three channels (R, G, B) of color image as a single unit and it extracts better representative features and which further improves classification. In this paper, we have trained Quaternion residual network on a publicly available large Chest X-Ray dataset on Kaggle repository and obtained classification accuracy of 93.75% and F-score of.94. We have also compared our performance with other CNN architectures. We found that classification accuracy was higher with Quaternion Residual network when we compared it with a real valued Residual network.","citedby-count":"17","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60114539","afid":"60114539","affilname":"JSS Academy of Technical Education, Noida","affiliation-city":"Noida","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010747","afid":"60010747","affilname":"Harcourt Butler Technical University","affiliation-city":"Kanpur","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57214306348","authid":"57214306348","orcid":"0000-0001-7980-9889","authname":"Singh S.","surname":"Singh","given-name":"Sukhendra","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60114539"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24469034100","authid":"24469034100","authname":"Tripathi B.K.","surname":"Tripathi","given-name":"B.

For this purpose, a variable structure control approach is employed due to its ability to deal with the partial loss of actuator effectiveness and adjusting the maximum amplitude of the control signal by a control gain. A modified sliding variable is designed based on angular velocity and attitude errors with an adaptive parameter coefficient. The dynamics equation of the adaptive parameter is extracted during the stability proof of the closed-loop system. Changing the value of this parameter changes the effect intensity of the quaternion errors on the sliding variable and causes the attitude errors to maintain within a limited range. Applying this parameter to the modified sliding variable makes the controller perform well even if the adaptive parameter is significantly reduced. Furthermore, directly using the adaptive parameter in the structure of control law makes the controller generate a chattering-free torque. Comparing the simulation results with the results of two variable structure control methods designed in previous articles shows that its performance in attitude tracking commands has improved. In addition, Monte Carlo simulations with random actuator faults are performed to show the robustness of the proposed controller in the presence of actuator constraints and external disturbances.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005710","afid":"60005710","affilname":"Malek Ashtar University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tehran","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35174932100","authid":"35174932100","authname":"Sadigh S.M.","surname":"Sadigh","given-name":"Sevil M.","initials":"S.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005710"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54920814500","authid":"54920814500","authname":"Kashaninia A.","surname":"Kashaninia","given-name":"Abdorreza","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005710"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56374197300","authid":"56374197300","authname":"Dehghan S.M.M.","surname":"Dehghan","given-name":"Seyyed Mohammad Mehdi","initials":"S.M.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005710"}]}],"authkeywords":"Actuator faults | Fault tolerant control | Magnetorquer | Satellite attitude tracking control | Variable structure control","article-number":"04021113","source-id":"16252","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85114956260"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85114956260?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85114956260&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85114956260&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85114956260","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85114956260","eid":"2-s2.0-85114956260","dc:title":"Quaternion cartesian fractional hahn moments for color image analysis","dc:creator":"Yamni M.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","prism:issn":"13807501","prism:eIssn":"15737721","prism:volume":"81","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"737-758","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"January 2022","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11042-021-11432-8","dc:description":"Moment descriptors have been widely used for the analysis and representation of images.

This paper proposes a joint quaternion valued singular spectrum analysis (QSSA) and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) based method for performing the sleeping stage classification. First, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is employed for decomposing the electroencephalograms (EEGs) into various waves. Then, both the QSSA and the EEMD are applied for denoising these waves. Finally, the features are extracted from the selected components and the bootstrap aggregating (bagging) classifier is employed for performing the sleeping stage classification. Sixteen sleeping records obtained from both the Sleep-EDF database and the Sleep-EDF expanded database in the Physio bank are employed for performing the evaluation. A statistical analysis is conducted. The computer numerical simulation results show that the accuracies achieved by our proposed algorithm for the 6 state stage classification to the 2 state stage classification based on the EEGs in the Sleep-EDF database are 89.39%, 90.66%, 94.09%, 94.17%, and 97.50%, respectively.

Also, the classification accuracies achieved by our proposed method are higher than those achieved by the existing methods. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007155","afid":"60007155","affilname":"Guangdong University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57243442900","authid":"57243442900","authname":"Huang Z.","surname":"Huang","given-name":"Zuo","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007155"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57210406493","authid":"57210406493","authname":"Ling B.W.K.","surname":"Ling","given-name":"Bingo Wing Kuen","initials":"B.W.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007155"}]}],"authkeywords":"Bagging | Ensemble empirical mode decomposition | Multi-channel electroencephalograms | Quaternion valued singular spectrum analysis | Sleeping stage classification","article-number":"103086","source-id":"4700152237","fund-acr":"NNSFC","fund-no":"2017KCXTD011","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85113870014"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85113870014?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85113870014&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85113870014&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85113870014","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85113870014","eid":"2-s2.0-85113870014","dc:title":"Quaternion-Based Dictionary Learning and Saturation-Value Total Variation Regularization for Color Image Restoration","dc:creator":"Huang C.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","prism:issn":"15209210","prism:eIssn":"19410077","prism:volume":"24","prism:pageRange":"3769-3781","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/TMM.2021.3107162","dc:description":"Color image restoration is a critical task in imaging sciences. Most variational methods regard the color image as a Euclidean vector or the direct combination of three monochrome images and completely ignore the inherent color structures within channels. To better describe the relationship of color channels, we represent the color image as the so-called pure quaternion matrix. Note that the celebrated dictionary learning method has attracted considerable attention for image recovery in the past decade. Following this idea, we propose a novel quaternion-based color image recovery method. This model combines the advantages of dictionary learning and the total variation method for color image restoration. The new strategy used in the proposed model manages to handle the color image restoration problem in the quaternion space. Moreover, the new proposed model can be easily solved by the classical alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate clearly that the performance of our proposed dictionary learning method is better than some state-of-the-art color image dictionary learning and total variation methods in terms of some criteria and visual quality.","citedby-count":"7","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009400","afid":"60009400","affilname":"Nanjing University of Post and TeleCommunications","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006541","afid":"60006541","affilname":"The University of Hong Kong","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002798","afid":"60002798","affilname":"Chinese University of Hong Kong","affiliation-city":"Hong Kong","affiliation-country":"Hong Kong"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57238469700","authid":"57238469700","orcid":"0000-0002-9347-3151","authname":"Huang C.","surname":"Huang","given-name":"Chaoyan","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009400"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34571761900","authid":"34571761900","orcid":"0000-0001-6833-5227","authname":"Ng M.K.","surname":"Ng","given-name":"Michael K.","initials":"M.K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006541"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57129572900","authid":"57129572900","orcid":"0000-0002-9880-8619","authname":"Wu T.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Tingting","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009400"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25423412800","authid":"25423412800","orcid":"0000-0002-0688-202X","authname":"Zeng T.","surname":"Zeng","given-name":"Tieyong","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002798"}]}],"authkeywords":"Dictionary learning | image restoration | pure quaternion | total variation","source-id":"16211","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"12300218","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85104196422"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85104196422?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85104196422&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85104196422&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85104196422","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85104196422","eid":"2-s2.0-85104196422","dc:title":"Deep-IRTarget: An Automatic Target Detector in Infrared Imagery Using Dual-Domain Feature Extraction and Allocation","dc:creator":"Zhang R.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","prism:issn":"15209210","prism:eIssn":"19410077","prism:volume":"24","prism:pageRange":"1735-1749","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1109/TMM.2021.3070138","dc:description":"Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have brought impressive improvements for object detection. However, detecting targets in infrared images still remains challenging, because the poor texture information, low resolution and high noise levels of the thermal imagery restrict the feature extraction ability of CNNs. In order to deal with these difficulties in the feature extraction, we propose a novel backbone network named Deep-IRTarget, composing of a frequency feature extractor, a spatial feature extractor and a dual-domain feature resource allocation model. Hypercomplex Infrared Fourier Transform is developed to calculate the infrared intensity saliency by designing hypercomplex representations in the frequency domain, while a convolutional neural network is invoked to extract feature maps in the spatial domain. Features from the frequency domain and spatial domain are stacked to construct Dual-domain features. To efficiently integrate and recalibrate them, we propose a Resource Allocation model for Features (RAF). The well-designed channel attention block and position attention block are used in RAF to respectively extract interdependent relationships among channel and position dimensions, and capture channel-wise and position-wise contextual information. Extensive experiments are conducted on three challenging infrared imagery databases. We achieve 10.14%, 9.1% and 8.05% improvement on mAP scores, compared to the current state of the art method on MWIR, BITIR and WCIR respectively.","citedby-count":"42","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60105232","afid":"60105232","affilname":"ShanghaiTech University","affiliation-city":"Shanghai","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023932","afid":"60023932","affilname":"University of Technology Sydney","affiliation-city":"Sydney","affiliation-country":"Australia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016835","afid":"60016835","affilname":"Beijing Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190091565","authid":"57190091565","orcid":"0000-0002-5460-7196","authname":"Zhang R.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Ruiheng","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189636947","authid":"57189636947","orcid":"0000-0001-8215-6663","authname":"Xu L.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Lixin","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57224881347","authid":"57224881347","authname":"Yu Z.","surname":"Yu","given-name":"Zhengyu","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60105232"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57212547461","authid":"57212547461","authname":"Shi Y.","surname":"Shi","given-name":"Ye","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023932"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35915109900","authid":"35915109900","authname":"Mu C.","surname":"Mu","given-name":"Chengpo","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55643281400","authid":"55643281400","orcid":"0000-0001-9581-8849","authname":"Xu M.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Min","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023932"}]}],"authkeywords":"Convolutional neural networks | feature extraction | infrared imagery | object detection","source-id":"16211","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055499924"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055499924?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85055499924&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85055499924&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055499924","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85055499924","eid":"2-s2.0-85055499924","dc:title":"Inertial navigation system gyroscopic on-line calibration assisted by marine star sensor based on forgetting factor selection of a Sage-Husa filter","dc:creator":"Wang Q.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Marine Engineering and Technology","prism:issn":"20464177","prism:eIssn":"20568487","prism:volume":"21","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"1-8","prism:coverDate":"2022-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2022","prism:doi":"10.1080/20464177.2018.1535014","dc:description":"In the process of ship autonomous navigation, the complex changes of the external environment lead to unknown statistical characteristics of star sensor measurement noise, which brings the estimation results of standard Kalman filtering divergence, and gyroscope on-line calibration cannot be effectively carried out. In view of the above problems, this paper proposed a gyroscope on-line calibration method assisted by star sensor based on forgetting factor selection of a Sage-Husa filter. According to the angular velocity, the output of gyroscope, and quaternion obtained from star sensor, the system error model with unknown noise statistical characteristics is established. Based on the judgment method of fuzzy logic, the error quaternion is used as the input, and the fuzzy rule is used to select the parameters of the adaptive filtering. Therefore, the measurement noise parameters of the filter are constantly estimated and corrected. Finally, the algorithm is verified by simulation test. The simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively estimate the gyroscope drift, scale factor under the case of changes in the external environment, and improve the accuracy and applicability of the navigation system.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003353","afid":"60003353","affilname":"Harbin Engineering University","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55568235800","authid":"55568235800","authname":"Wang Q.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Qiuying","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003353"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202613158","authid":"57202613158","authname":"Zhang M.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Minghui","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003353"}]}],"source-id":"21100470126","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"2016RAQXJ022","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
