Biquaternion is a more generalized algebra of quaternion, which has attracted scholars' research interest in recent years. In this paper, a new transform is proposed called the biquaternion linear canonical transforms (BiQLCTs). Due to the noncommutativity of biquaternion algebra multiplication, there are three different types of the BiQLCTs: Left-sided BiQLCT, right-sided BiQLCT, and two-side BiQLCT. The transforms are the extension of the complex linear canonical transforms. Then, the relationships between the three kinds of transforms are obtained. Next, based on the right-side biquaternion linear canonical transform (RBiQLCT), some general properties of this transform are proved. Moreover, the convolution and correlation theorems of the RBiQLCT are studied. As an application, according to the convolution operator and convolution theorem, the biquaternion linear time-invariant system is analyzed. Finally, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for the RBiQLCT is established.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016835","afid":"60016835","affilname":"Beijing Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007381","afid":"60007381","affilname":"Yangzhou University","affiliation-city":"Yangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57214335899","authid":"57214335899","orcid":"0000-0002-9995-4626","authname":"Gao W.B.","surname":"Gao","given-name":"Wen Biao","initials":"W.B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007381"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36071614100","authid":"36071614100","orcid":"0000-0002-3850-4656","authname":"Li B.Z.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Bing Zhao","initials":"B.Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016835"}]}],"authkeywords":"biquaternion linear canonical transforms | biquaternion linear time-invariant system | convolution theorem | quaternion linear canonical transforms | uncertainty principle","source-id":"24594","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"62171041","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149240039"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149240039?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149240039&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85149240039&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149240039","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85149240039","eid":"2-s2.0-85149240039","dc:title":"Deep quaternion convolutional neural networks for breast Cancer classification","dc:creator":"Singh S.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","prism:issn":"13807501","prism:eIssn":"15737721","prism:volume":"82","prism:issueIdentifier":"20","prism:pageRange":"31285-31308","prism:coverDate":"2023-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"August 2023","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11042-023-14688-4","dc:description":"Breast Cancer nowadays has been a major cause of death in women worldwide and this has also been confirmed by the World Health Organization. The severity of this disease can be minimized to a large extent if it is diagnosed properly at an early stage. Two important types of tumors found in the case of breast cancer are malignant and benign. Moreover, It has been observed that, unlike benign tumors, malignant tumors are more dangerous because of their invasive nature. Therefore, the proper treatment of a patient having cancer can be processed in a better way, if the type of tumor can be identified as early as possible. Deep neural networks have delivered a remarkable performance for detecting malignant tumors in histopathological images of breast tissues. However, the existing works today, are focused much on real-valued numbers. When data is multi-channel such as images and audio, conventional real-valued CNN on flattening and concatenating loses spatial relation within a channel. To address the above-said issues, we have exploited a quaternion residual network for detecting breast cancer in a dataset of histopathological images, which are publically available in the dataset of Kaggle. In this work, we first transform breast histopathological images into quaternion domains. Second, the Residual CNN was customized to work in the quaternion domain so that it extracts the better representative features for multidimensional input objects. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model architecture although takes slightly more time to train but it offers an increased classification accuracy of 97.20% which is more than the performance of a residual network compatible with real numbers. Also, the proposed model outperforms when compared against the baseline neural network models.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60114539","afid":"60114539","affilname":"JSS Academy of Technical Education, Noida","affiliation-city":"Noida","affiliation-country":"India"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010747","afid":"60010747","affilname":"Harcourt Butler Technical University","affiliation-city":"Kanpur","affiliation-country":"India"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57214306348","authid":"57214306348","orcid":"0000-0001-7980-9889","authname":"Singh S.","surname":"Singh","given-name":"Sukhendra","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60114539"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24469034100","authid":"24469034100","authname":"Tripathi B.K.","surname":"Tripathi","given-name":"B.

In this paper, a classification by principal component regression (CbPCR) strategy is proposed. This strategy depends on performing regression of each data class in terms of its principal components. This CbPCR formulation leads to a new formulation of the Linear Regression Classification (LRC) problem that preserves the key information of the data classes while providing more compact closed-form solutions. For the sake of image classification, this strategy is also extended to the 4D hypercomplex domains to take into account the color information of the image. Quaternion and reduced biquaternion CbPCR strategies are proposed by representing each channel of the color image as one of the imaginary parts of a quaternion or reduced biquaternion number. Experiments on two color face recognition benchmark databases show that the proposed methods achieve better accuracies by a margin of about 3% over the original LRC and like methods.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60273339","afid":"60273339","affilname":"Faculty of Computers and Information","affiliation-city":"Asyut","affiliation-country":"Egypt"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60273137","afid":"60273137","affilname":"Faculty of Engineering","affiliation-city":"Asyut","affiliation-country":"Egypt"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60273131","afid":"60273131","affilname":"Faculty of Science","affiliation-city":"Asyut","affiliation-country":"Egypt"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6507344161","authid":"6507344161","orcid":"0000-0003-0146-5515","authname":"El-Melegy M.T.","surname":"El-Melegy","given-name":"Moumen T.","initials":"M.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60273137"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201855562","authid":"57201855562","authname":"Kamal A.T.","surname":"Kamal","given-name":"Aliaa T.","initials":"A.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60273339"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005077804","authid":"7005077804","authname":"Hussain K.F.","surname":"Hussain","given-name":"Khaled F.","initials":"K.F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60273339"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602588590","authid":"6602588590","authname":"El-Hawary H.M.","surname":"El-Hawary","given-name":"H.

Fortunately, the Hyers-Ulam stability happens to be one of the important means to deal with this problem. In this article, the issue of Hyers-Ulam stability of QVNNs with time-varying delays is addressed. First, inspired by the Hyers-Ulam stability of general functional equations, the concept of the Hyers-Ulam stability of QVNNs is proposed along with the QVNNs model. Then, by utilizing the successive approximation method, both delay-dependent and delay-independent Hyers-Ulam stability criteria are obtained to ensure the Hyers-Ulam stability of the QVNNs considered.

There are some challenges when aligning aerial and close-range photogrammetric point clouds, such as huge view differences caused by the different sights of the sensors, massive noisy points due to the error in dense matching, and scale uncertainty since there are no control points for absolute orientation. To achieve complementary advantages of aerial and close-range point clouds, in this paper, a robust cross-source point clouds registration method is proposed using image visual context features and scale consistency. First, a cross-view image matching method based on image visual context features is proposed to obtain corresponding points. Second, to overcome the challenges of noisy points and scale differences, an outlier filtering method is designed based on scale consistency. Finally, the dual quaternions model considering the scale factor is introduced to solve the spatial transformation model. To analyze the feasibility of this method qualitatively and quantitatively, experiments are conducted using the public scene dataset of Dortmund, Germany, and the scene dataset of Zhengzhou City, China. Three kinds of cross-source point clouds registration experiments are conducted in this paper, including aerial and close-range point clouds registration in Dortmund, and aerial and ground point clouds registrations in both Dortmund and Zhengzhou. The chamfer distances of the three sets of experiments are 4.48 m, 5.97 m and 4.78 m, respectively. The ablation study shows that the outlier filtering method and the dual quaternions model improve the accuracy by at least 14% and 25%, respectively. The experiments demonstrate that the method accomplishes the cross-source point clouds registration in large-scale scenes accurately and efficiently, providing a solid foundation for subsequent fine 3D reconstruction.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60069731","afid":"60069731","affilname":"Information Engineering University China","affiliation-city":"Zhengzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/128342282","afid":"128342282","affilname":"China Electronics Corporation","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57837057700","authid":"57837057700","orcid":"0000-0001-8454-9591","authname":"Chu G.","surname":"Chu","given-name":"Guanghan","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069731"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26028322300","authid":"26028322300","authname":"Fan D.","surname":"Fan","given-name":"Dazhao","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069731"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191866077","authid":"57191866077","authname":"Dong Y.","surname":"Dong","given-name":"Yang","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069731"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36070568500","authid":"36070568500","authname":"Ji S.","surname":"Ji","given-name":"Song","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069731"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219033413","authid":"57219033413","authname":"Gu L.","surname":"Gu","given-name":"Linyu","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069731"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57490957600","authid":"57490957600","authname":"Li D.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Dongzi","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60069731"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58370587300","authid":"58370587300","authname":"Zhang W.","surname":"Zhang","given-name":"Wu","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"128342282"}]}],"authkeywords":"computer vision | image matching | image processing","source-id":"5400152646","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"42‐Y30B04‐9001‐19/21","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85165784617"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85165784617?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85165784617&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85165784617&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85165784617","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85165784617","eid":"2-s2.0-85165784617","dc:title":"A novel hybrid cryptosystem based on DQFrFT watermarking and 3D-CLM encryption for healthcare services","dc:creator":"Khallaf F.","prism:publicationName":"Frontiers of Information Technology and Electronic Engineering","prism:issn":"20959184","prism:eIssn":"20959230","prism:volume":"24","prism:issueIdentifier":"7","prism:pageRange":"1045-1061","prism:coverDate":"2023-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2023","prism:doi":"10.1631/FITEE.2200372","dc:description":"Quaternion algebra has been used to apply the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) to color images in a comprehensive approach. However, the discrete fractional random transform (DFRNT) with adequate basic randomness remains to be examined. This paper presents a novel multistage privacy system for color medical images based on discrete quaternion fractional Fourier transform (DQFrFT) watermarking and three-dimensional chaotic logistic map (3D-CLM) encryption. First, we describe quaternion DFRNT (QDFRNT), which generalizes DFRNT to handle quaternion signals effectively, and then use QDFRNT to perform color medical image adaptive watermarking. To efficiently evaluate QDFRNT, this study derives the relationship between the QDFRNT of a quaternion signal and the four components of the DFRNT signal. Moreover, it uses the human vision system’s (HVS) masking qualities of edge, texture, and color tone immediately from the color host image to adaptively modify the watermark strength for each block in the color medical image using the QDFRNT-based adaptive watermarking and support vector machine (SVM) techniques. The limitations of watermark embedding are also explained to conserve watermarking energy. Second, 3D-CLM encryption is employed to improve the system’s security and efficiency, allowing it to be used as a multistage privacy system. The proposed security system is effective against many types of channel noise attacks, according to simulation results.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60273778","afid":"60273778","affilname":"Faculty of Engineering","affiliation-city":"6th October","affiliation-country":"Egypt"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60105146","afid":"60105146","affilname":"Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University","affiliation-city":"Riyadh","affiliation-country":"Saudi Arabia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015723","afid":"60015723","affilname":"Prince Sultan University","affiliation-city":"Riyadh","affiliation-country":"Saudi Arabia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003419","afid":"60003419","affilname":"Faculty of Electronic Engineering","affiliation-city":"Shibin El Kom","affiliation-country":"Egypt"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222593878","authid":"57222593878","orcid":"0009-0008-1917-8251","authname":"Khallaf F.","surname":"Khallaf","given-name":"Fatma","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003419"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60273778"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55819860600","authid":"55819860600","orcid":"0000-0001-7509-2120","authname":"El-Shafai W.","surname":"El-Shafai","given-name":"Walid","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003419"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015723"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/42161378200","authid":"42161378200","authname":"El-Rabaie E.S.M.","surname":"El-Rabaie","given-name":"El Sayed M.","initials":"E.S.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003419"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003625335","authid":"7003625335","authname":"Soliman N.F.","surname":"Soliman","given-name":"Naglaa F.","initials":"N.F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60105146"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58144208000","authid":"58144208000","authname":"El-Samie F.E.A.","surname":"El-Samie","given-name":"Fathi E.Abd","initials":"F.E.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60105146"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive watermarking | Color medical image | Encryption | Fractional transform | Quaternion | Three-dimensional chaotic logistic map (3D-CLM) | TP391","source-id":"21100409130","fund-acr":"PNU","fund-no":"PNURSP2023R66","fund-sponsor":"Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85163715622"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85163715622?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85163715622&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85163715622&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85163715622","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85163715622","eid":"2-s2.0-85163715622","dc:title":"Efficient iterative method for generalized Sylvester quaternion tensor equation","dc:creator":"Hu J.","prism:publicationName":"Computational and Applied Mathematics","prism:issn":"22383603","prism:eIssn":"18070302","prism:volume":"42","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2023","prism:doi":"10.1007/s40314-023-02374-y","dc:description":"In this study, we employ the biconjugate residual (BCR) algorithm in tensor form to deal with the generalized Sylvester quaternion tensor equation in order to find the minimum norm solution.

Currently, the cost to reliably predict displacements and frequencies of risers, umbilicals and mooring lines is very high. To obtain good results through low-cost hardware, the collected data require careful signal treatment and validation of the entire procedure. To create a low-cost solution for further application, this work carried out two experimental studies: decay tests on a vertically clamped cylinder in air and decay tests on a spar platform model in a water tank. To validate the inertial measurement unit (IMU) displacement results, we have tested different positions and initial excitations. The signal was treated by applying a Kalman filter to extract the angles of the IMU, and a rotation quaternion was built at each time step. The double integration of the acceleration vector to calculate the body displacement is studied, filtering out noise and drift problems with Fourier filter and final intrinsic mode function. The frequencies and displacement time histories obtained by the IMU were compared with those of an optical tracking system. The result was an average relative error of less than 2.8% for air and water decay tests, validating the use of low-cost hardware compensated with signal treatment.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025272","afid":"60025272","affilname":"The University of Tokyo","affiliation-city":"Tokyo","affiliation-country":"Japan"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017609","afid":"60017609","affilname":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina","affiliation-city":"Florianopolis","affiliation-country":"Brazil"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008088","afid":"60008088","affilname":"Universidade de São Paulo","affiliation-city":"Sao Paulo","affiliation-country":"Brazil"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602501229","authid":"6602501229","orcid":"0000-0003-3538-5898","authname":"Fujarra A.L.C.","surname":"Fujarra","given-name":"André Luís Condino","initials":"A.L.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017609"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222290060","authid":"57222290060","authname":"Leal A.P.","surname":"Leal","given-name":"Aline Peres","initials":"A.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008088"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202012113","authid":"57202012113","authname":"Carnier R.M.","surname":"Carnier","given-name":"Rodrigo Matos","initials":"R.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025272"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35882060000","authid":"35882060000","authname":"Gonçalves R.T.","surname":"Gonçalves","given-name":"Rodolfo Trentin","initials":"R.T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025272"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55704124900","authid":"55704124900","authname":"Suzuki H.","surname":"Suzuki","given-name":"Hideyuki","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025272"}]}],"authkeywords":"Digital filtering | Experimental validation | Inertial measurement unit (IMU) | Signal processing | Vibration tracking","article-number":"356","source-id":"71359","fund-acr":"KAKEN","fund-no":"S20142","fund-sponsor":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85162029588"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85162029588?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85162029588&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85162029588&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1319157823001581"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85162029588","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85162029588","eid":"2-s2.0-85162029588","dc:title":"Implementation of a steganography system based on hybrid square quaternion moment compression in IoMT","dc:creator":"Tahiri M.A.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences","prism:issn":"13191578","prism:eIssn":"22131248","prism:volume":"35","prism:issueIdentifier":"7","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2023","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jksuci.2023.101604","pii":"S1319157823001581","dc:description":"Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) systems generate medical data transmissions between patients, medical experts, and medical centers over public networks, which require high levels of security to protect the content of medical images and the personal information they contain. In this paper, we propose a new stego image encryption scheme based on a new secret image compression method, wavelet transformation, QR decomposition of the cover image, and a new chaotic map. The secret image is compressed by the Hahn-Krawtchouk hybrid quaternion square moments (HK-HQSM), which are optimized by a new hybrid metaheuristic algorithm based on the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) and the Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA). To increase the security level when transmitting the proposed stego images over public networks, we introduce a new chaotic map based on the 2D fractional Henon map to encrypt the stego image. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed steganography scheme for IoMT, we implemented this scheme on a low-cost Raspberry Pi 4 hardware board. The results of the performed numerical experiments show that our method is secure and provides exceptional robustness against common standard image processing attacks (steganalysis attacks). The results also demonstrate that our strategy is able to work efficiently and quickly when implemented on a Raspberry Pi board.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031707","afid":"60031707","affilname":"Michigan State University","affiliation-city":"East Lansing","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024326","afid":"60024326","affilname":"Laboratoire d'Electronique, Signaux, Systèmes et d'Informatique, Université Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah","affiliation-city":"Fez","affiliation-country":"Morocco"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017021","afid":"60017021","affilname":"Université Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah","affiliation-city":"Fez","affiliation-country":"Morocco"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012078","afid":"60012078","affilname":"Faculty of Science","affiliation-city":"Mansoura","affiliation-country":"Egypt"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005353","afid":"60005353","affilname":"College of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Riyadh","affiliation-country":"Saudi Arabia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002714","afid":"60002714","affilname":"Université Cadi Ayyad","affiliation-city":"Marakech","affiliation-country":"Morocco"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/121938343","afid":"121938343","affilname":"Torrens University Australia","affiliation-city":"Brisbane","affiliation-country":"Australia"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "10", "$" :"10"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57219553337","authid":"57219553337","authname":"Tahiri M.A.","surname":"Tahiri","given-name":"Mohamed Amine","initials":"M.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024326"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57221256972","authid":"57221256972","authname":"Bencherqui A.","surname":"Bencherqui","given-name":"Ahmed","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017021"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190495161","authid":"57190495161","orcid":"0000-0001-9225-8380","authname":"Karmouni H.","surname":"Karmouni","given-name":"Hicham","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002714"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201499521","authid":"57201499521","authname":"Amakdouf H.","surname":"Amakdouf","given-name":"Hicham","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017021"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/51461922300","authid":"51461922300","authname":"Mirjalili S.","surname":"Mirjalili","given-name":"Seyedali","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"121938343"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189293481","authid":"57189293481","orcid":"0000-0002-6846-8908","authname":"Motahhir S.","surname":"Motahhir","given-name":"Saad","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017021"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56565521700","authid":"56565521700","orcid":"0000-0003-2846-4707","authname":"Abouhawwash M.","surname":"Abouhawwash","given-name":"Mohamed","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031707"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012078"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "8", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/33367530800","authid":"33367530800","authname":"Askar S.S.","surname":"Askar","given-name":"S.

Firstly, potential function is introduced to tackle attitude pointing constraints. Then, by jointly designing sign function and potential function, the anti-unwinding performance can also be achieved. Furthermore, the relevant information of angular velocity is obtained by utilizing first-order passive filter with the attitude error quaternion. Moreover, by properly selecting candidate Lyapunov function, the feasibility of attitude constraints can be rigorously proved under the proposed control law, while the stability of the system can be guaranteed without signal of angular velocity and information of inertia matrix.

The monochromatic and the concatenation model have been widely used to process color images by processing each color channel independently or concatenating three color channels as one unified one and then used existing grayscale image processing methods directly without specific operations. These above schemes, however, have some limitations: (1) they would destroy the inherent correlation among three color channels since they cannot represent color images holistically; (2) they usually focus on one specific handcrafted prior such as smoothness, low-rankness, or even deep prior and thus failing to fuse deep and handcrafted priors of color images flexibly. To conquer these limitations, we propose one unified model to integrate deep prior and low-rank quaternion prior (DLRQP) for color image processing under the plug-and-play (PnP) framework. Specifically, the quaternion representation with low-rank constraint is introduced to denote the color image in a holistic way and one advanced denoiser is adopted to explore the deep prior in an iterative process. To tightly approximate the quaternion rank, one nonconvex penalty function is further utilized. We derive an alternate iterative approach to tackle the proposed model. We empirically demonstrate that our model can achieve superior performance over existing methods on both color image denoising and inpainting tasks.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019616","afid":"60019616","affilname":"Harbin Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Harbin","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/125884806","afid":"125884806","affilname":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Novel Security Intelligence Technologies","affiliation-city":"Shenzhen","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57886632700","authid":"57886632700","authname":"Xu T.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Tingting","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58086348500","authid":"58086348500","authname":"Kong X.","surname":"Kong","given-name":"Xiaoyu","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194655641","authid":"57194655641","orcid":"0000-0002-3564-6042","authname":"Shen Q.","surname":"Shen","given-name":"Qiangqiang","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193685022","authid":"57193685022","orcid":"0000-0003-1970-1993","authname":"Chen Y.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Yongyong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019616"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"125884806"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24175343600","authid":"24175343600","orcid":"0000-0002-4487-6384","authname":"Zhou Y.","surname":"Zhou","given-name":"Yicong","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]}],"authkeywords":"color image denoising | color image inpainting | deep prior | Low-rank quaternion representation | plug-and-play","source-id":"26027","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"2022B1212010005","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85145673314"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85145673314?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85145673314&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85145673314&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85145673314","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85145673314","eid":"2-s2.0-85145673314","dc:title":"Harmonic multi-symplectic Lanczos algorithm for quaternion singular triplets","dc:creator":"Jia Z.","prism:publicationName":"Numerical Algorithms","prism:issn":"10171398","prism:eIssn":"15729265","prism:volume":"93","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"1309-1335","prism:coverDate":"2023-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"July 2023","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11075-022-01469-7","dc:description":"The computation of quaternion singular triplets has become one of the core targets of color image processing.

A novel harmonic multi-symplectic Lanczos algorithm is presented for approximating extreme quaternion singular triplets, which performs real operations entirely and stores only four parts of quaternion matrices or vectors. The underlying theory is to preserve an algebraic structure during the partial bidiagonalization, the argumentation, and the restarted bidiagonalization. Both the smallest and largest quaternion singular triples are computed with high precision and in short calculation time. The proposed algorithm is applied to color video semantic segmentation.

The novel path design algorithm is based on local polynomial regression, which produces a smooth attitude path by receiving the size and timing of maneuvers in each axis according to the desired imaging mode. This algorithm is described for stereo and snapshot modes in an imaging operation. The adaptive robust tracking control (ARTC) law is designed using quaternion algebra to perform the required maneuvers in an attitude path. The ARTC structure includes a sliding mode strategy, a projection-based adaptive model compensation, and a linear feedback term. Suitable conditions for imaging in each mode and the time of taking the image are determined by defining and evaluating the attitude control indices. These indices are defined by the half-cone error along the payload line of sight and relative performance error as a jitter with a 3-sigma confidence level. Despite the challenges in the path design, such as smoothness, system agility, and finite time realization of indices, in a conventional stereo imaging mode, taking an image in the nadir-pointing attitude is neglected. As a result, our work provides suitable conditions for taking the image in this attitude with an interval of 1.2 s. Finally, numerical simulations and verification are performed using multidisciplinary simulation, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and model-based ARTC law.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016248","afid":"60016248","affilname":"K.

To alleviate a bottleneck problem, in this paper, a new approach named sparse-based fractional Levy quaternion extended Kalman filter (SFLQEKF) is formulated for the prognostic of stochastic time series. Initially, the stochastic time series is decomposed into the static component and the dynamic component resorting to the piecewise representation through a new improved sparse low-rank matrix (SLRM) approximation algorithm namely singular value penalty resonance sparse signal decomposition (SVP-RSSD). Afterward, both static component and dynamic component are predicted individually through the proposed fractional Levy quaternion extended Kalman filter (FLQEKF) method, the final time series of interest can be obtained by integrating the predicted static- and dynamic components correspondingly, in which a new predictive derivation of the proposed FLQEKF model is formulated for the first time by considering fractional-order characteristic and Levy flight process damping term, hence the issue of oscillating indeterminacy induced from classical extended Kalman filter (EFK) can be addressed. Eventually, the prognostic behavior of the proposed approach is investigated via the stochastic time series conducted from two experimental cases, the predicted results illustrate the availability and applicability of the proposed approach compared with three state-of-the-art benchmarks.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015487","afid":"60015487","affilname":"Anhui Agricultural University","affiliation-city":"Hefei","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191695881","authid":"57191695881","orcid":"0000-0001-7170-4679","authname":"Li Q.","surname":"Li","given-name":"Qing","initials":"Q.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015487"}]}],"authkeywords":"fractional Levy quaternion extended Kalman filter (FLQEKF) | Levy flight process | Multidimensional prognostic | singular value penalty resonance sparse signal decomposition(SVP-RSSD) | stochastic time series","source-id":"4700152204","fund-acr":"ASU","fund-no":"RC412104","fund-sponsor":"Arizona State University","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85134766687"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85134766687?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85134766687&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85134766687&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0273117722005865"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85134766687","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85134766687","eid":"2-s2.0-85134766687","dc:title":"The international DORIS service contribution to ITRF2020","dc:creator":"Moreaux G.","prism:publicationName":"Advances in Space Research","prism:issn":"02731177","prism:eIssn":"18791948","prism:volume":"72","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"65-91","prism:coverDate":"2023-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 July 2023","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.asr.2022.07.012","pii":"S0273117722005865","dc:description":"For the realization of the 2020 International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF2020), the International DORIS Service delivered to the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) a set of 1456 weekly solution files from 1993.0 to 2021.0 including station coordinates and Earth orientation parameters (EOPs). The data come from fourteen DORIS satellites: TOPEX/Poseidon, SPOT-2, SPOT-3, SPOT-4, SPOT-5, Envisat, Jason-1, Jason-2, Cryosat-2, Saral, HY-2A, Jason-3, Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B. In their processing, the four analysis centers which contributed to the DORIS combined solution used the latest time variable gravity models, the new mean pole and diurnal-subdiurnal tidal EOP models recommended by IERS. In addition, all the analysis centers included in their processing precise SPOT-5 solar panel angle values and quaternions for, at least, the Jason satellites. Furthermore, a new Alcatel phase center variation model was implemented for the ITRF2020 processing. The main objective of this study is to present the combination process and to analyze the impact of the new modeling on the performance of the new combined solution. Comparisons with the IDS contribution to ITRF2014 show that i) the application of the new phase center variations for the Alcatel DORIS ground antennas in the data processing combined with the gradual replacement over time of the Alcatel by Starec antennas implies a scale drift from 1993.0 to 2002.5 and ii) thanks to a better modeling of the surface forces on the satellites, the new combined solution shows smaller annual and 118-day signals in the geocenter. A new DORIS terrestrial reference frame was computed to evaluate the intrinsic quality of the new combined solution. That evaluation shows that over almost the full time span the intrinsic IDS scale values lie in a range of ±5 mm. After mid-2008, the new DORIS reference frame has an internal position consistency in North-East-Up better than 7.5 mm.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true",

for the processing of precision instruments. This paper proposes a kinematics-based motion-force control (KBMFC) scheme for redundant manipulators, which is driven by joint velocity commands and different from the dynamics-based methods. Specifically, the force and motion are modeled and decoupled in the end-effector frame with the help of a stiffness coefficient. To control the orientation of the force, a quaternion control equation is designed by combining the rotation matrix and neural dynamics method. Different from traditional motion-force control methods, the proposed scheme is constructed as quadratic programming with the corresponding recurrent neural network (RNN) solver derived, which considers the kinematic optimization index and joint constraints. According to the generated control signals, a redundant manipulator is able to accurately fulfill the hybrid control of motion and force with the desired quaternion, which is intuitively confirmed by simulations and experiments. Note to Practitioners - This paper is motivated by the deficiencies that restrict the real-world applications of the motion-force control of redundant manipulators. On the one hand, most existing motion-force control schemes are implemented under the framework of dynamics, which inevitably leads to some kinematics-related defects. On the other hand, the latest kinematics-based techniques introduce an admittance control to achieve motion-force control. However, they model the force in the Z-axis of the base coordinate while the motion planning is limited in the X-Y plane, which dramatically reduces real-world applications. In this paper, the deformation force is designed in the end-effector frame, and a quaternion control technology of the end-effector is developed. Such a scheme can realize the real-time control of the orientation and magnitude of the force while ensuring trajectory tracking. In addition, the introduction of optimization indexes and joint constraints dramatically improves the functionality of the proposed scheme. Finally, the contributions of this paper are verified through simulations, experiments and comparisons. This work proposes a feasible framework for the motion-force control and orientation control of redundant manipulators.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60273098","afid":"60273098","affilname":"Chongqing Institute of Green and Intelligent Technology","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028265","afid":"60028265","affilname":"Lanzhou University","affiliation-city":"Lanzhou","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/112912025","afid":"112912025","affilname":"Science and Technology on Communication Networks Laboratory","affiliation-city":"Shijiazhuang","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57217060348","authid":"57217060348","orcid":"0000-0003-0414-7950","authname":"Xie Z.","surname":"Xie","given-name":"Zhengtai","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028265"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"112912025"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403329173","authid":"7403329173","orcid":"0000-0002-5329-5098","authname":"Jin L.","surname":"Jin","given-name":"Long","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028265"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"112912025"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36460171200","authid":"36460171200","orcid":"0000-0002-1348-5305","authname":"Luo X.","surname":"Luo","given-name":"Xin","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60273098"}]}],"authkeywords":"motion-force control | physical experiment | quaternion control | recurrent neural network (RNN) | Redundant manipulators","source-id":"17340","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85152129349"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85152129349?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85152129349&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85152129349&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0950705123002551"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85152129349","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85152129349","eid":"2-s2.0-85152129349","dc:title":"Quaternion Representation Learning for cross-modal matching","dc:creator":"Wang Z.","prism:publicationName":"Knowledge-Based Systems","prism:issn":"09507051","prism:volume":"270","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2023-06-21","prism:coverDisplayDate":"21 June 2023","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.knosys.2023.110505","pii":"S0950705123002551","dc:description":"The main challenge of cross-modal matching is to construct a shared subspace reflecting semantic closeness. Asymmetric relevance, especially the one-to-many matching case where multiple correspondences of a given query from the other modality can be obtained, has seriously exacerbated this difficulty. Recently, many approaches based on deep metric learning and probability distribution fitting have made great progress. However, these methods cannot generalize well to other approaches for their too many hyper-parameters or uncontrollable instability. In addition, we argue that the representational ability of common space learned in real space is insufficient and the symmetric similarity calculations adopted by the previous work fail to capture the asymmetric relevance. To seek a remedy for these problems, this work introduces a novel and effective approach called Quaternion Representation Learning (QRL) for better cross-modal matching. Specifically, benefiting from the strong expressive power and richer representation capability of quaternion space with three imaginary components, our proposed QRL method can better represent the shared semantic. Due to the inherent asymmetry of the Hamilton product and its latent inter-dependencies of components, our QRL method can model the asymmetric relevance and capture the complex similarity among intra- and inter-modal interaction. Another advantage is that our QRL method can be utilized in conjunction with other existing methods to promote cross-modal matching. Extensive experiments on two commonly used image-text matching benchmarks, i.e., MSCOCO and Flickr30K, and two widely used video-text retrieval datasets, including MSRVTT and TGIF, demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed QRL method.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005465","afid":"60005465","affilname":"University of Electronic Science and Technology of China","affiliation-city":"Chengdu","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56532885200","authid":"56532885200","orcid":"0000-0002-9318-0084","authname":"Wang Z.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Zheng","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55647047300","authid":"55647047300","authname":"Xu X.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Xing","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57215288880","authid":"57215288880","authname":"Wei J.","surname":"Wei","given-name":"Jiwei","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203385327","authid":"57203385327","authname":"Xie N.","surname":"Xie","given-name":"Ning","initials":"N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57002035900","authid":"57002035900","orcid":"0000-0003-2615-1555","authname":"Shao J.","surname":"Shao","given-name":"Jie","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57222954946","authid":"57222954946","authname":"Yang Y.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Yang","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005465"}]}],"authkeywords":"Asymmetric relevance modeling | Image-text matching | Quaternion Representation Learning | Video-text retrieval","article-number":"110505","source-id":"24772","fund-acr":"MEXT","fund-no":"2023YFG0289","fund-sponsor":"Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85166210452"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85166210452?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85166210452&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85166210452&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85166210452","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85166210452","eid":"2-s2.0-85166210452","dc:title":"Compression of photographic images by the quaternion Wavelet transform associated with SPIHT coding and comparative study with wavelet transform","dc:creator":"Ledoux E.E.B.","prism:publicationName":"International Journal on Electrical Engineering and Informatics","prism:issn":"20856830","prism:eIssn":"20875886","prism:volume":"15","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"305-318","prism:coverDate":"2023-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2023","prism:doi":"10.15676/ijeei.2023.15.2.9","dc:description":"In many fields, the digital image replaces traditional analog images such as photographs, x-rays, etc. The large number of raw data required to describe it makes the transmission time often too long and the too costly storage.

As electromyography (EMG) signals occur before movement, they can be used as input signals for the exoskeletons to predict the body’s movement intention. In this paper, the OpenSim software is used to determine the muscle sites to be measured, i.e., rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, semitendinosus, biceps femoris, lateral gastrocnemius, and tibial anterior. The surface electromyography (sEMG) signals and inertial data are collected from the lower limbs while the human body is walking, going upstairs, and going uphill. The sEMG noise is reduced by a wavelet-threshold-based complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) reduction algorithm, and the time-domain features are extracted from the noise-reduced sEMG signals. Knee and hip angles during motion are calculated using quaternions through coordinate transformations. The random forest (RF) regression algorithm optimized by cuckoo search (CS), shortened as CS-RF, is used to establish the prediction model of lower limb joint angles by sEMG signals. Finally, root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2) are used as evaluation metrics to compare the prediction performance of the RF, support vector machine (SVM), back propagation (BP) neural network, and CS-RF.

This method does not fully consider the spectral correlation between color channels, which may casuse distortion of the denoising results. Quaternion convolution can solve this problem by treating a color pixel as a whole. However, a single quaternion convolutional network can not restore the image details well. To solve the problem, a dual-channel quaternion convolutional network (DQNet) for color random impulse noise removal is proposed. Firstly, according to the strategy of structure channel and color channel fusion, a structure detail restoration network based on dilated convolution is proposed to obtain structure and edge features, and quaternion convolution network is used to extract cross-channel color information. Secondly, aiming at the problem that convolution operation will cause partial global information loss, the long line connection is used to fuse the input noise image with the convolution results, and then, a feature enhancement module based on attention mechanism is designed to guide the network to extract potential noise features from complex background. Finally, the residual learning is used to achieve the restoration of color random impulse noise. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has better denoising performance, especially in moderate noise level or high noise level.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025256","afid":"60025256","affilname":"Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010606","afid":"60010606","affilname":"East China Jiaotong University","affiliation-city":"Nanchang","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003030","afid":"60003030","affilname":"Chongqing Jiaotong University","affiliation-city":"Chongqing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56067839000","authid":"56067839000","authname":"Cao Y.","surname":"Cao","given-name":"Yiqin","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010606"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57443896100","authid":"57443896100","authname":"Rao Z.","surname":"Rao","given-name":"Zhechu","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010606"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57213268188","authid":"57213268188","authname":"Zhu Z.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Zhiliang","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010606"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025256"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58307078600","authid":"58307078600","authname":"Wan S.","surname":"Wan","given-name":"Sui","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003030"}]}],"authkeywords":"deep learning | dual-channel | image denoising | quaternion convolution | random impulsive noise","source-id":"21101088821","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61861016","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85153672936"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85153672936?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85153672936&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85153672936&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0016003223002284"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85153672936","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85153672936","eid":"2-s2.0-85153672936","dc:title":"Tensor form of GPBiCG algorithm for solving the generalized Sylvester quaternion tensor equations","dc:creator":"Zhang X.F.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of the Franklin Institute","prism:issn":"00160032","prism:volume":"360","prism:issueIdentifier":"9","prism:pageRange":"5929-5946","prism:coverDate":"2023-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"June 2023","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jfranklin.2023.04.009","pii":"S0016003223002284","dc:description":"Sylvester quaternion tensor equations have a wide range of applications in image processing and system and control theory.
