The total least squares for quaternions (QTLS) is a generalisation of the real-valued total least squares and is introduced rigorously, starting from the existence condition for low-rank approximation of quaternion matrices. Then, a quaternion Rayleigh quotient (QRQ) is defined to establish the link between the QTLS solution and the minimisation of the QRQ. Finally, the rank-one update formula is employed to allow for fast iterative solution based on the QRQ. Through simulations, the WL-QRTLS was shown to exhibit superior performance, under perturbations on both input and output signals, to other adaptive filtering of the same class - the widely linear quaternion least mean squares (WL-QLMS) and the widely linear quaternion recursive least squares (WL-QRLS).

The recent HR calculus is a step forward and provides a way to calculate derivatives and gradients of both analytic and non-analytic functions of quaternion variables; however, the HR calculus can become cumbersome in complex optimization problems due to the lack of rigorous product and chain rules, a consequence of the non-commutativity of quaternion algebra. To address this issue, we introduce the generalized HR (GHR) derivatives which employ quaternion rotations in a general orthogonal system and provide the left- and right-hand versions of the quaternion derivative of general functions. The GHR calculus also solves the long-standing problems of product and chain rules, mean-value theorem and Taylor's theorem in the quaternion field. At the core of the proposed GHR calculus is quaternion rotation, which makes it possible to extend the principle to other functional calculi in non-commutative settings. Examples in statistical learning theory and adaptive signal processing support the analysis.","citedby-count":"51","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021097","afid":"60021097","affilname":"University of Surrey","affiliation-city":"Guildford","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60015150","afid":"60015150","affilname":"Imperial College London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009509","afid":"60009509","affilname":"Northeast Normal University","affiliation-city":"Changchun","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23394265800","authid":"23394265800","authname":"Xu D.","surname":"Xu","given-name":"Dongpo","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009509"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36668682800","authid":"36668682800","authname":"Jahanchahi C.","surname":"Jahanchahi","given-name":"Cyrus","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56614550100","authid":"56614550100","authname":"Took C.C.","surname":"Took","given-name":"Clive C.","initials":"C.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021097"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006513328","authid":"7006513328","authname":"Mandic D.P.","surname":"Mandic","given-name":"Danilo P.","initials":"D.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60015150"}]}],"authkeywords":"Generalized HR calculus | Non-analytic quaternion function | Nonlinear quaternion functions | Quaternion derivatives | Quaternion least mean square","article-number":"150255","source-id":"21100446014","fund-acr":"EPSRC","fund-no":"EP/H026266/1","fund-sponsor":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"publisherfullgold"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Gold"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84939243808"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84939243808?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84939243808&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84939243808&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0923596515000958"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84939243808","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84939243808","eid":"2-s2.0-84939243808","dc:title":"Quaternionic wavelet coefficients modeling for a Reduced-Reference metric","dc:creator":"Traoré A.","prism:publicationName":"Signal Processing: Image Communication","prism:issn":"09235965","prism:volume":"36","prism:pageRange":"127-139","prism:coverDate":"2015-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 August 2015","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.image.2015.06.003","pii":"S0923596515000958","dc:description":"Abstract This paper proposes a new Reduced-Reference metric based on the modeling of the Quaternionic Wavelet Transform coefficients from Information Criteria. To obtain the Reduced-References, we will model the Quaternionic Wavelet Transform coefficients using probability density functions whose parameters are used as Reduced-References. Information Criteria are proposed in order to build optimal histograms of the Quaternionic Wavelet Transform coefficients and to obtain the number of distributions in the mixture model. The Quaternionic Wavelet Transform is an improvement of the Discrete Wavelet Transform providing a richer scale-space analysis for 2-D signals. This recent transform separates the information contained in the image better than a classical Discrete Wavelet Transform, and provides a multiscale image analysis whose coefficients are 2D analytic, with one near-shift invariant magnitude and with phase information. From these models, we propose a measure of degradation by comparing probability density functions of the reference image and the distributions of the degraded image of the Quaternionic Wavelet Transform subbands. We shall demonstrate that one phase of the Quaternionic Wavelet Transform provides relevant information in the Image Quality Assessment. Experimentation confirmed the potential of this new structural information (this Reduced-Reference system produces good coefficients of correlation with the Human Visual System).","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032653","afid":"60032653","affilname":"Universite de Poitiers","affiliation-city":"Poitiers","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190341457","authid":"57190341457","authname":"Traoré A.","surname":"Traoré","given-name":"Albekaye","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032653"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36008284700","authid":"36008284700","authname":"Carré P.","surname":"Carré","given-name":"Philippe","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032653"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102402126","authid":"7102402126","authname":"Olivier C.","surname":"Olivier","given-name":"Christian","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032653"}]}],"authkeywords":"Information Criteria | Model selection | Quaternionic Wavelet Transform | Reduced-Reference Image Quality Assessment","article-number":"14973","source-id":"13803","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84938864811"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84938864811?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84938864811&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84938864811&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84938864811","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84938864811","eid":"2-s2.0-84938864811","dc:title":"Quaternion Approach to Solve Coupled Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation and Crosstalk of Quarter-Phase-Shift-Key Signals in Polarization Multiplexing Systems","dc:creator":"Liu L.L.","prism:publicationName":"Chinese Physics Letters","prism:issn":"0256307X","prism:eIssn":"17413540","prism:volume":"32","prism:issueIdentifier":"8","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2015-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 August 2015","prism:doi":"10.1088/0256-307X/32/8/084202","dc:description":"The quaternion approach to solve the coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations (CNSEs) in fibers is proposed, converting the CNSEs to a single variable equation by using a conception of eigen-quaternion of coupled quaternion.

The parameter identification procedures rely on the shaping of the invariant manifold introduced in the adaptation algorithm. The main contribution of the paper is to propose the algorithm to identify the unknown system parameters without designing reference signals for the satisfaction of a rank condition. In order to guarantee the convergence of the estimator to the true system parameters, a three-stage estimation algorithm is proposed.

For unit pure quaternion k, first, the relationships existing between the components of QDFT coefficients and the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of three RGB color channels are established; then, the symmetrical constraints were presented, which one must follow when modifying QDFT coefficients; finally, QDFT, Arnold transform and a multiple redundant embedding strategy are combined for watermarking.

The vibrations in hand-held surgical instruments caused by physiological tremor can cause unacceptable imprecision in microsurgery. To rectify this problem, many adaptive filtering-based methods have been developed to model the tremor to remove it from the tip of microsurgery devices. The existing tremor modeling algorithms such as the weighted Fourier Linear Combiner (wFLC) algorithm and its extensions operate on the x, y, and z dimensions of the tremor signals independently. These algorithms are blind to the dynamic couplings between the three dimensions. We hypothesized that a system that takes these coupling information into account can model the tremor with more accuracy compared to the existing methods. Tremor data was recorded from five novice subjects and modeled with a novel quaternion weighted Fourier Linear Combiner (QwFLC). We compared the modeling performance of the proposed QwFLC with that of the conventional wFLC algorithm. Results showed that QwFLC improves the modeling performance by about 20% at the cost of higher computational complexity.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012704","afid":"60012704","affilname":"Kyungpook National University","affiliation-city":"Daegu","affiliation-country":"South Korea"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006222","afid":"60006222","affilname":"Newcastle University","affiliation-city":"Newcastle","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56808983400","authid":"56808983400","authname":"Adhikari K.","surname":"Adhikari","given-name":"Kabita","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006222"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54947284700","authid":"54947284700","authname":"Tatinati S.","surname":"Tatinati","given-name":"Sivanagaraja","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012704"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8703318200","authid":"8703318200","authname":"Veluvolu K.C.","surname":"Veluvolu","given-name":"Kalyana C.","initials":"K.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012704"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23390436100","authid":"23390436100","authname":"Nazarpour K.","surname":"Nazarpour","given-name":"Kianoush","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006222"}]}],"article-number":"7146744","source-id":"21100291854","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryvor"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84938629917"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84938629917?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84938629917&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84938629917&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84938629917","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84938629917","eid":"2-s2.0-84938629917","dc:title":"Fractal descriptors based on quaternion Fourier transform for color texture analysis","dc:creator":"Zhu F.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Electronic Imaging","prism:issn":"10179909","prism:eIssn":"1560229X","prism:volume":"24","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2015-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 July 2015","prism:doi":"10.1117/1.JEI.24.4.043004","dc:description":"Texture and color are important features in analyzing images of natural scenes. Fractal descriptors based on quaternion Fourier transform and local polynomial regression are proposed for color texture image analysis. First, considering the relation between the power spectrum and frequency in the quaternion Fourier transform domain, we proposed fractal dimensions of a color image using a fast quaternion Fourier transform. Second, local polynomial regression is applied to estimate log(spectrum)-log(frequency) curve, which is not usually linear in a natural texture image. Finally, a local polynomial regression curve is defined as fractal descriptors for the color image classification problem with multiclasses. The experimental results show that our proposed approach is more effective than other color texture analysis methods both in the correct classification rate and the duration.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60073496","afid":"60073496","affilname":"Changshu Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Changshu","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017482","afid":"60017482","affilname":"Jiangsu University","affiliation-city":"Zhenjiang","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005244","afid":"60005244","affilname":"Southeast University","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56389126600","authid":"56389126600","authname":"Zhu F.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Feng","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017482"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8361829000","authid":"8361829000","authname":"Dai M.","surname":"Dai","given-name":"Meifeng","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017482"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55421358400","authid":"55421358400","authname":"Xie C.","surname":"Xie","given-name":"Conghua","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60073496"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15830670600","authid":"15830670600","authname":"Song Y.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Yuqing","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017482"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55618730600","authid":"55618730600","authname":"Luo L.","surname":"Luo","given-name":"Limin","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]}],"authkeywords":"fractal dimension | image classification | local polynomial regression | quaternion Fourier transform | texture analysis","article-number":"43004","source-id":"25978","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84943279039"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84943279039?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84943279039&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84943279039&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84943279039","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84943279039","eid":"2-s2.0-84943279039","dc:title":"Quaternion-based Local Binary Patterns for illumination invariant face recognition","dc:creator":"Rizo-Rodriguez D.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of 2015 International Conference on Biometrics, ICB 2015","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781479978243"}],"prism:pageRange":"257-263","prism:coverDate":"2015-06-29","prism:coverDisplayDate":"29 June 2015","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICB.2015.7139093","dc:description":"Face recognition under varying illumination conditions has benefited from the encapsulation of face features into a quaternion representation. In particular, a quaternion-based representation encoding four LBP descriptors (one-pixel to four-pixel radius) has delivered interesting recognition scores when using just one training image per subject. However, each coefficient of such a representation only encapsulates the eight sampling values required for computing a classic LBP code. In this paper, we propose a quaternion representation which encodes additional LBP codes at each radius. Consequently, a wider pixel descriptor is obtained because further sampling values are considered in the region surrounding the reference pixel. Illumination invariant face verification and identification experiments are conducted by using only one training face image. The representation proposed improves the recognition rates reported by the representation only encapsulating classic LBP codes.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011832","afid":"60011832","affilname":"Université de Sherbrooke","affiliation-city":"Sherbrooke","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36622544700","authid":"36622544700","authname":"Rizo-Rodriguez D.","surname":"Rizo-Rodriguez","given-name":"Dayron","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011832"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004105959","authid":"7004105959","authname":"Ziou D.","surname":"Ziou","given-name":"Djemel","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011832"}]}],"article-number":"7139093","source-id":"21100414355","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85024134716"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85024134716?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85024134716&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85024134716&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85024134716","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85024134716","eid":"2-s2.0-85024134716","dc:title":"Phase-based heart motion estimation in multimodality cardiac imaging","dc:creator":"Alessandrini M.","prism:publicationName":"Multi-modality Cardiac Imaging: Processing and Analysis","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781118574362"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781848212350"}],"prism:pageRange":"217-246","prism:coverDate":"2015-06-09","prism:coverDisplayDate":"9 June 2015","prism:doi":"10.1002/9781118574362.ch6","dc:description":"This chapter presents two methods for motion estimation. After an introduction to the concepts of hypercomplex signals and of spatial phase, the two methods proposed are described and applied to cardiac image sequences. The first motion estimation method uses the spatial phases of MR images calculated with two 2D SOASs. The second method is based on a formulation of the optical flow that makes use of the properties of monogenic signals, on a local affine modeling of motion and a multiscale analysis that enables the local selection of the most appropriate motion estimation. The chapter proposes a comparison between Sühling's algorithm and the algorithm based on the extracted phase of the monogenic signal exploiting either a motion model by translation or an affine motion model. The result proves to reinforce the idea that the hypothesis of phase conservation during the cardiac cycle is very well suited for ultrasound imaging.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60062760","afid":"60062760","affilname":"CREATIS (Centre de Recherche en Acquisition et Traitement de l'Image pour la Santé)","affiliation-city":"Villeurbanne","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027245","afid":"60027245","affilname":"Université Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier","affiliation-city":"Toulouse","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000874","afid":"60000874","affilname":"Université Catholique de Louvain","affiliation-city":"Louvain-la-Neuve","affiliation-country":"Belgium"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book","subtype":"ch","subtypeDescription":"Book Chapter","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24802199400","authid":"24802199400","authname":"Alessandrini M.","surname":"Alessandrini","given-name":"Martino","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000874"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23024104000","authid":"23024104000","authname":"Basarab A.","surname":"Basarab","given-name":"Adrian","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027245"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201758591","authid":"57201758591","authname":"Bernard O.","surname":"Bernard","given-name":"Olivier","initials":"O.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60062760"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602903906","authid":"6602903906","authname":"Delachartre P.","surname":"Delachartre","given-name":"Philippe","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60062760"}]}],"authkeywords":"2D single-orthant analytic signal | Affine motion model | Cardiac imaging | Magnetic resonance image | Monogenic signal | Motion estimation | Optical flow estimator | Spatial phase image | Sühling's algorithm | Ultrasound imaging","source-id":"21100823303","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84946119647"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84946119647?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84946119647&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84946119647&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84946119647","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84946119647","eid":"2-s2.0-84946119647","dc:title":"Color Image Reconstruction Using Quaternion Legendre-Fourier Moments in Polar Pixels","dc:creator":"Camacho-Bello C.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - 2014 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics, Electronics, and Automotive Engineering, ICMEAE 2014","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781479942237"}],"prism:pageRange":"3-8","prism:coverDate":"2015-06-09","prism:coverDisplayDate":"9 June 2015","prism:doi":"10.1109/ICMEAE.2014.34","dc:description":"Color image reconstruction provides a measure of the feature representation capability of the moment functions.

All attitude controllers use a quaternion error to compute control signals that are calculated from an actual quaternion and a desired quaternion obtained from a position controller. Attitude and position control laws are computed using a PD, LQR and backstepping control technique. All combinations of controllers will be verified by simulation. We add noise, apply an actuator restriction and use a different sampling period for position and attitude feedback signals to get the simulation closer to real conditions. Moreover, external disturbances were implemented into the simulation; hence a disturbance observer along with a position estimator will be designed to improve the performance of the presented controllers. The performance of all combinations of controllers was evaluated using various quality indicators, such as the integral of absolute errors and total thrust, settling times and also maximum overshoots when external disturbance was applied. Some of the controllers exhibit very similar behaviour, so we chose the three best controllers for each scenario used in the simulation.","citedby-count":"60","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006861","afid":"60006861","affilname":"Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava","affiliation-city":"Bratislava","affiliation-country":"Slovakia"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56495256300","authid":"56495256300","authname":"Chovancová A.","surname":"Chovancová","given-name":"A.","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006861"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56271952100","authid":"56271952100","authname":"Fico T.","surname":"Fico","given-name":"T.","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006861"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12752187600","authid":"12752187600","authname":"Hubinský P.","surname":"Hubinský","given-name":"P.","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006861"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/38861335100","authid":"38861335100","authname":"Duchoň F.","surname":"Duchoň","given-name":"F.","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006861"}]}],"authkeywords":"Backstepping controller | Disturbance observer | LQR | Position estimator | Quadrotor | Quaternion","source-id":"18079","fund-acr":"KEGA","fund-no":"003STU-4/2014","fund-sponsor":"Kultúrna a Edukacná Grantová Agentúra MŠVVaŠ SR","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84937547456"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84937547456?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84937547456&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84937547456&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84937547456","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84937547456","eid":"2-s2.0-84937547456","dc:title":"DOA estimation using dimension reduction quaternion estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques","dc:creator":"Zhao J.","prism:publicationName":"Dianbo Kexue Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Radio Science","prism:issn":"10050388","prism:volume":"30","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"483-490","prism:coverDate":"2015-06-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 June 2015","prism:doi":"10.13443/j.cjors.2014052501","dc:description":"In quaternion model, both azimuth and elevation angles of signals should be known before using the conventional quaternion estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (Q-ESPRIT) to estimate the polarized signal angles with uniform linear array (ULA), which consists of co-centered orthogonal loop and dipole (COLD) antennas. The existence of “quaternion model coherence problem” also results in the loss of orthogonal information and the necessity of long vector model for signals' the polarization information estimation. This paper solves the above problem effectively by proposing a novel dimension reduction quaternion ESPRIT (DRQ-ESPRIT) algorithm based on cross-correlation matrix. Making full use of the orthogonality and data structure of the quaternion model, the proposed algorithm can estimate the direction of arrivals (DOA) and polarization information of signals with one time eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) operation, and has a less computation.

The fast adaptation is achieved from the introduced stable adaptation dynamics in the closed-loop system which cannot be expected in the conventional adaptive controller designed upon the certainty equivalence framework. The development of the proposed adaptive control algorithm relies on the two newly introduced algebraic operations. The one is a dual filter for a dual relative error signal. The dual filter essentially has a linear low-pass filter structure and enables us to recast the system dynamics into a linear parameter-affine system dynamics in dual quaternions combined with dual control inputs. The other is an isomorphism between a dual quaternion and a vector for the error measurement. Using this isomorphism, the stability proof of the closed-loop dual quaternion system based on the proposed Lyapunov-like function is rewritten in the form of familiar matrix/vector algebra. In order to demonstrate the performance improvement, numerical simulation results are given, which compare the proposed adaptive control method with the conventional one from the certainty-equivalence principle.","citedby-count":"35","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028872","afid":"60028872","affilname":"Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University","affiliation-city":"Daytona Beach","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23036490000","authid":"23036490000","authname":"Seo D.","surname":"Seo","given-name":"Dongeun","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028872"}]}],"authkeywords":"Adaptive control | Dual quaternion | Non-certainty equivalence","source-id":"12372","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84921341403"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84921341403?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84921341403&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84921341403&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0030401815000073"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84921341403","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84921341403","eid":"2-s2.0-84921341403","dc:title":"Combining double random phase encoding for color image watermarking in quaternion gyrator domain","dc:creator":"Shao Z.","prism:publicationName":"Optics Communications","prism:issn":"00304018","prism:volume":"343","prism:pageRange":"56-65","prism:coverDate":"2015-05-15","prism:coverDisplayDate":"15 May 2015","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.optcom.2015.01.002","pii":"S0030401815000073","dc:description":"Quaternion representation of color image has attracted great attention due to its capability to treat holistically the three color channels. In a more general way, it has successfully been used in multi-channel signal processing applications over the past few decades. In this study, a joint encryption/watermarking system with more security based on double random phase encoding (DRPE) in quaternion gyrator transform domain is addressed. In the proposed scheme, an RGB-scale watermark image together with a grayscale watermark image or not is encoded into a quaternion matrix and encrypted through the DRPE, the encrypted data is then fused into the middle coefficients of the quaternion gyrator-transformed host image. In the process of extracting watermarks, it is impossible to retrieve them without authorized keys. Compared with the three channels independently processing approach implemented in fractional Fourier domain, the proposed algorithm achieves lower complexity by reason of avoiding repetitive operations. Experimental results have demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed algorithm and its superior performance in terms of noise robustness.","citedby-count":"29","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60110235","afid":"60110235","affilname":"IMT Atlantique","affiliation-city":"Nantes","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005244","afid":"60005244","affilname":"Southeast University","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/107034829","afid":"107034829","affilname":"Centre de Recherche en Information Biomédicale Sino-Français (CRIBs)","affiliation-city":"Rennes","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55849891700","authid":"55849891700","authname":"Shao Z.","surname":"Shao","given-name":"Zhuhong","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55769205900","authid":"55769205900","authname":"Duan Y.","surname":"Duan","given-name":"Yuping","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60110235"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6505931513","authid":"6505931513","authname":"Coatrieux G.","surname":"Coatrieux","given-name":"Gouenou","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60110235"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34874119700","authid":"34874119700","authname":"Wu J.","surname":"Wu","given-name":"Jiasong","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"107034829"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56486728900","authid":"56486728900","authname":"Meng J.","surname":"Meng","given-name":"Jinyu","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7203086899","authid":"7203086899","authname":"Shu H.","surname":"Shu","given-name":"Huazhong","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"107034829"}]}],"authkeywords":"Color image | Double random phase encoding | Encryption and decryption | Quaternion gyrator transform | Watermarking","source-id":"12352","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"61073138","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84938070509"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84938070509?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84938070509&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84938070509&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84938070509","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84938070509","eid":"2-s2.0-84938070509","dc:title":"A watermarking algorithm of color images based on quaternion fourier transform","dc:creator":"Wang W.J.","prism:publicationName":"Beijing Ligong Daxue Xuebao/Transaction of Beijing Institute of Technology","prism:issn":"10010645","prism:volume":"35","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"533-537","prism:coverDate":"2015-05-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 May 2015","prism:doi":"10.15918/j.tbit1001-0645.2015.05.019","dc:description":"A watermarking algorithm of color images based on the quaternion Fourier transform (QFFT) and improved quantization index modulation algorithm (QIM) was proposed in this paper.

First of all, a laser tracker and a probability statistic method are used to calibrate the electromagnetic positioning system, which can acquire the realistic coordinates of marked points. Then, the puncture needle calibration adapts a spatial multi-gesture method to collect the positions of needle points through the positioning system, and applies the theories of homogeneous coordinate and quaternion to solve the coordinate transformation problem between the real space and virtual space. Finally, an operation standard of the patient registration is proposed for surgeons. The experimental results tested with the surgical robot indicate that the precision of the registration has reached 0.0402 mm. Therefore, the registration algorithm can meet the clinical requirements of image guided surgery.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019533","afid":"60019533","affilname":"Tianjin University","affiliation-city":"Tianjin","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56671447000","authid":"56671447000","authname":"Chen Y.","surname":"Chen","given-name":"Yanmei","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019533"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55605770726","authid":"55605770726","authname":"Yang Z.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Zhiyong","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019533"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55603461000","authid":"55603461000","authname":"Jiang S.","surname":"Jiang","given-name":"Shan","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019533"}]}],"authkeywords":"Electromagnetic positioning | Image guided surgery | Patient registration | Puncture needle calibration | Quaternion theory","source-id":"25574","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
