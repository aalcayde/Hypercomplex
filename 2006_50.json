The rigid parameters can be defined by an m × m rotation matrix, a diagonal m × m scale matrix, and an m × 1 translation vector. All together, the total number of parameters to be found is m(m + 2). Several least squares based algorithms have recently appeared in the literature. These algorithms are all based on a singular value decomposition (SVD) of the m × m cross-covariance matrix between the two data sets. However, there are cases where the SVD based algorithms return a reflection matrix rather than a rotation matrix. Some authors have introduced a simple correction for guarding against such cases. Other types of algorithm are based on unit quaternions which guarantee obtaining a true rotation matrix. In this paper we introduce a principal component based registration algorithm which is solved in closed-form. By using matrix vectorization properties the problem can be cast as one of finding a rank-1 symmetric projection matrix. This is equivalent to solving a Sylvester equation with equality constraints. Once the solution is obtained, we apply the inverse vectorization operation to estimate the rotation and scale matrices, along with the translation vector. We apply the proposed algorithm to the alignment of ECG signals and compare the results to those obtained by the SVD and quaternion based algorithms. © 2006 IEEE.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024609","afid":"60024609","affilname":"Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis","affiliation-city":"Indianapolis","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021032","afid":"60021032","affilname":"School of Electrical and Computer Engineering","affiliation-city":"Atlanta","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007249","afid":"60007249","affilname":"Universidade do Porto","affiliation-city":"Porto","affiliation-country":"Portugal"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15925910100","authid":"15925910100","authname":"Ramos J.A.","surname":"Ramos","given-name":"J.

This is achieved by defining a generalized intensity (GI) component as a weighted average of the MS bands, with weights taken either as percentages of overlap between the spectral responses of individual bands and the spectral response of panchromatic (Pan), or better as regression coefficients between the MS bands and the decimated Pan image. In the former case the weights are pre-calculated for each sensor. In the latter case, the weights are calculated by applying a multivariate regression to the data that are being fused. The above GI component is used as low-resolution approximation of the Pan image. Experimental results carried out on very-high resolution IKONOS data demonstrate that the proposed enhanced GS method visually outperforms both modes of the ENVI implementation of GS, especially in true color displays. Quantitative scores performed on spatially degraded data by means of such parameters as Wald's ERGAS and the novel Q4 score index based on quaternions theory, confirm the superiority of the enhanced GS method over its baseline.","citedby-count":"58","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021859","afid":"60021859","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Firenze","affiliation-city":"Florence","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021199","afid":"60021199","affilname":"Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004905120","authid":"7004905120","authname":"Aiazzi B.","surname":"Aiazzi","given-name":"Bruno","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021199"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56962582100","authid":"56962582100","authname":"Baronti S.","surname":"Baronti","given-name":"Stefano","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021199"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003740044","authid":"7003740044","authname":"Selva M.","surname":"Selva","given-name":"Massimo","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021199"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005912959","authid":"7005912959","authname":"Alparone L.","surname":"Alparone","given-name":"Luciano","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021859"}]}],"article-number":"4242123","source-id":"82000","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34948814138"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34948814138?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=34948814138&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=34948814138&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34948814138","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:34948814138","eid":"2-s2.0-34948814138","dc:title":"A new method for MS + pan image fusion assessment without reference","dc:creator":"Alparone L.","prism:publicationName":"International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"0780395107"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9780780395107"}],"prism:pageRange":"3785-3788","prism:coverDate":"2006-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2006","prism:doi":"10.1109/IGARSS.2006.974","dc:description":"In this work we investigate the use of Shannon's information theory for the goal of devising quality scores of image fusion results that do not require reference originals, in particular, the mutual information between resampled original and fused MS bands is used to measure the spectral quality, while the mutual information between the Pan image and the fused bands yields a measure of spatial quality.

The purpose of the algorithm is to reduce the required number of tracked GPS satellites and antenna baselines needed to correctly resolve the ambiguities. This new motion-based method relies on data from several sample times. The vehicle must rotate about one or more axes among the samples. The solution algorithm works in two stages. It first solves a nonlinear least-squares problem in which the single-differenced carrier-phase ambiguities are allowed to vary as continuous real numbers. The second stage solves a nonlinear least-squares problem that restricts the ambiguities to be integers. This latter algorithm uses a combined Newton/Levenberg-Marquardt method to deal with attitude quaternion nonlinearities, and it uses the least-squares ambiguity decorrelation adjustment method to deal with the integers. The second-stage algorithm is very accurate, but it needs to use initial guesses generated from first-stage algorithm solutions to find the global optimum. If the maneuver is large enough, then this new method can reliably solve difficult attitude/ambiguity-resolution problems. This capability has been demonstrated using Monte Carlo simulation. In one set of cases, the new algorithm correctly resolves ambiguities and achieves an accuracy of 4 deg or better when using two GPS satellite signals received by three antennas that are arrayed along 1-m baselines.","citedby-count":"33","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104946","afid":"60104946","affilname":"Cornell University College of Engineering","affiliation-city":"Ithaca","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010401","afid":"60010401","affilname":"American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.","affiliation-city":"Reston","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007776","afid":"60007776","affilname":"Cornell University","affiliation-city":"Ithaca","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004139057","authid":"7004139057","authname":"Psiaki M.L.","surname":"Psiaki","given-name":"Mark L.","initials":"M.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007776"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60104946"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010401"}]}],"source-id":"29586","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33747385403"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33747385403?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33747385403&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33747385403&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33747385403","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:33747385403","eid":"2-s2.0-33747385403","dc:title":"The pyramidal order of the brain and the swarm of consciousness. Part two","dc:creator":"Díaz J.","prism:publicationName":"Salud Mental","prism:issn":"01853325","prism:volume":"29","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"1-10","prism:coverDate":"2006-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"May/June 2006","dc:description":"The present paper offers a particular emergence, dual aspect, and dynamic system theory of the neural correlate of consciousness. The theory is grounded on two successive hypotheses supported with empirical evidences and concepts from the neurosciences, approximations to the sciences of complexity, and philosophical arguments. The first hypothesis is that consciousness emerges along with the highest level of brain function, i.e., at the intermodular domain of the whole organ. This hypothesis is upheld by two necessary requisites; the first is the generalized impression in neuroscience of the brain as an information-handling device, and that this property enables every mental activity, including consciousness, to take place. This concept is verified on several empirical grounds. If we take the synapse as a binary code of information, the computation capacity of the brain is in the order of 100 million Megabits. Even such enormous figure is limited and misleading because the synapse manifests not only two, but three possible informational states (excitation, rest, and inhibition), because there are subliminal potentials, and also a compact intracellular information machinery. Moreover, the informational requirement of consciousness is accurately delivered by Kuffler and Nichols' five ruling principles of brain function: (1) The brain uses electrical signals to process information; (2) Such electrical signals are identical in all neurons; (3) The signals constitute codes of codification and representation; (4) The origin and destiny of the fibers determines the content of information; (5) The meaning of the signals lies in the interactions. Even though the reference to representation, content, and meaning implies higher cognitive properties, it seems necessary to add a sixth principle for a more judicious neural implication in regard to consciousness. This principle is that information is processed in the brain in six levels of complexity, undergoing a gradual gain in density, integration, congruity, and capacity in each consecutive stratum. The six levels are the following: (1) Organismic, the integration of the nervous system with the rest of the organism systems; (2) Organic, the integration of the different modules in the whole brain; (3) Modular, the set of brain modules and their interconnections; (4) Intercellular, the designs and functional bindings among neuron cells; (5) Cellular, the set of brain cells, particularly neurons; (6) Molecular, the chemical components that mediate the transmission of information. In this fashion, the second requisite to uphold the emergence of consciousness lies in establishing that the different levels of brain organization constitute a pyramidal arrangement. Certainly, the number of elements is greater in the lower levels, while the integration of information is progressively enhanced in the upper levels. Moreover, this neuropsychological pyramid insinuates both an ascending cascade whereby the lower orders stipulate and influence the upper ones, and a progressive and convergent functional enrichment ultimately resulting in the qualia, feeling, and awareness attributes of consciousness. Information flows horizontally in each level, but it also overflows vertically in both directions. This pyramidal scheme is applied to clarify two particular aspects of brain function that are closely linked to consciousness: the electrical activity and the engram of memory. Such inquiry makes clear that a qualitative jump manifested by the emergence of various and dissimilar novelties occur at each layer of brain operation based upon a mass coordination. It seems feasible to envision the engram, and conceivably every other mental representation, as a plastic pattern involving all levels and aspects of brain operation, including the pinnacle where consciousness consolidates as the subjective aspect of the uppermost brain function. As a result of the proposed stratified and pyramidal scheme of brain functions, the first hypotheses is strengthened and specified. Thus, presumably consciousness and the neural capacities correlated to it constitute two associated aspects emerging from such particular functional hierarchy at the organic level of the brain by the efficient connection of its modules. It would not be required that all the modules of the brain become interrelated during a conscious processing, but that they would be functionally available while some of them become progressively active by intermodular articulation thereby making possible the arising and unfolding of conscious mental operation streams. In order to reinforce this notion the visual system is invoked since the scene that is consciously perceived emerges from the coordination of some 40 modules that separately appear to operate unconsciously. At the moment that such high-hierarchy and complex function presumably appears, it would achieve a conscious correlate and become altogether able to exert a descending causality and supervene the operation of the lower orders, which, among other capacities, would permit voluntary action to take place. In order to specify the first hypothesis asserting that consciousness emerges at the organic level of the brain along with the proficient inter-modular connectivity, a second hypothesis is formulated and justified in neuroanatomical, neurophysiological, and complexity science terms. The supposition is that the specific neural correlate of consciousness may be a function similar to a bird flock or an insect swarm orderly binding the operations of different modules in a cinematic, hipercomplex, coherent, and synchronic stream. The human brain contains some 400 cortical and subcortical modules functioning as partially specialized stations that potentially interchange particularly codified information through some 2500 fibers or intermodular pathways. The hypothesis requires that information complexity undergoes a further and substantial gain of attributions through the concise and prolific connectivity of the different modules. In this regard, it is supposed that a stream of coherent activation is constituted in the conscious brain by the intermodular dynamics and that such dynamics may acquire global patterned properties in a similar way as bird flocks and so-called intelligent swarms achieve unanimously shifting dynamics. This particular idea is supported with complexity science models of the remarkable performances of large groups of birds and insects and with the known behavior of massive populations of neurons. In so far as this would be a complex function operating at the limits of equilibrium resulting from local dynamics of the brain subsystems, the self-organization of high level brain functions justifies the notion that a dynamic coupling among modules can and may result in complex cognitive properties and consciousness. Intermodular brain dynamics is conceived here as an emergent, unbound, synchronic, hypercomplex, highly coherent, and tetradimensional process capable to navigate, steer, swirl, split, and flow throughout the brain and thereby connect very diverse systems in a fast and efficient manner. In the same way, its putative subjective correlate, the conscious process, can be conceived as an emergent, voluntary, unified, qualitative, and narrative process capable to access, coordinate, and integrate multiple local information mechanisms. The hypothesis poses that the conscious transformation of information is correlated, moment to moment and point to point, with the intermodular processing that evolves in the manner of a bird flock or swarm dynamics. It is finally posed that brain intermodular dynamics correlated to consciousness consolidates by the convergence of an ascending bottom-up organization of the different ranks of brain operation, and by the descending top-down influx of the social, cultural, and environmental information where the individual is immersed.","citedby-count":"1","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"re","subtypeDescription":"Review","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56473221100","authid":"56473221100","authname":"Díaz J.","surname":"Díaz","given-name":"José Luis","initials":"J.L."}],"authkeywords":"Brain | Brain connectivity | Brain correlate of consciousness | Brain functional hierarchy | Brain modularity | Consciousness | Dual aspect theory | Dynamical systems | Emergence","source-id":"19332","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33746324835"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33746324835?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33746324835&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33746324835&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33746324835","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:33746324835","eid":"2-s2.0-33746324835","dc:title":"Robust optimization using disturbance for image registration","dc:creator":"Gan R.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"3540356487"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783540356486"}],"prism:volume":"4057 LNCS","prism:pageRange":"280-288","prism:coverDate":"2006-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2006","prism:doi":"10.1007/11784012_34","dc:description":"This paper exploits the different properties between the local neighborhood of global optimum and those of local optima in image registration optimization.

The surface is defined via dual points, the transformation is performed by rotations and translations based on screw theory while normal vector calculation is utilized for shading based on Phong's illumination model. The main benefit of this approach lies into the compactness of the surface's representation since geometrical characteristics, such as tangent vectors, that are necessary for shading algorithms, are included within its definition. An extensive comparison is performed between the proposed approach and the traditional homogeneous model, presenting the merits of our approach. Analytical and experimental determination of the computational cost via computer implementation of 3D surface transformation and shading is presented. Point-based methods for the representation, transformation and shading of parametrically defined surfaces are compared to the introduced line-based methods (dual quaternions and dual orthogonal matrices). It is shown that the simplified rendering procedure of 3D objects, is considerably faster using screw theory over the traditional point-based structures. © 2006 The Eurographics Association and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031155","afid":"60031155","affilname":"University of Patras","affiliation-city":"Rio","affiliation-country":"Greece"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14024597600","authid":"14024597600","authname":"Papageorgiou S.","surname":"Papageorgiou","given-name":"Stavros G.","initials":"S.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031155"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003803146","authid":"7003803146","authname":"Aspragathos N.","surname":"Aspragathos","given-name":"Nikos A.","initials":"N.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031155"}]}],"authkeywords":"Dual matrices | Dual quaternions | Parametrically defined surfaces | Screw theory | Shading | Transformation","source-id":"25023","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33744961593"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33744961593?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33744961593&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33744961593&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33744961593","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:33744961593","eid":"2-s2.0-33744961593","dc:title":"The piramidal order of the brain and the swarm of consciousness. Part one","dc:creator":"Díaz J.L.","prism:publicationName":"Salud Mental","prism:issn":"01853325","prism:volume":"29","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"7-12","prism:coverDate":"2006-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"March/April 2006","dc:description":"The present paper offers a particular emergence, dual aspect, and dynamic system theory of the neural correlate of consciousness. The theory is grounded on two successive hypotheses supported by empirical evidences and concepts from the neurosciences, approximations to the sciences of complexity, and philosophical arguments. The first hypothesis is that consciousness emerges along with the highest level of brain function, i.e., at the intermodular domain of the whole organ. This hypothesis is upheld by two necessary requisites. The first is the generalized impression in neurosciences of the brain as an information-handling device, and that this property enables every mental activity, including consciousness. This concept is verified on several empirical grounds. If we take the synapse as a binary code of information, the computation capacity of the brain is in the order of the 100 million megabits. Even such an enormous figure is limited and misleading because the synapse manifests not only two, but three possible informational states (excitation, rest, and inhibition), because there are subliminal potentials, and also a compact intracellular information machinery. Moreover, the informational requirement of consciousness is accurately delivered by Kuffler and Nichols' five ruling principles of brain function: 1. The brain uses electrical signals to process information; 2. such electrical signals are identical in all neurons; 3. the signals constitute codes of codification and representation; 4. the origin and destiny of the fibers determines the content of information; 5. the meaning of the signals lies in the interactions. Even though the reference to representation, content, and meaning implies higher cognitive properties, it seems necessary to add a sixth principle for a more judicious neural implication in regard to consciousness. This principle is that information is processed in the brain in six levels of complexity, undergoing a gradual gain in density, integration, congruity, and capacity in each consecutive stratum. The six levels are the following: 1. organismic, the integration of the nervous system with the rest of the organism systems; 2. organic, the integration of the different modules in the whole brain; 3. modular, the set of brain modules and their interconnections; 4. intercellular, the designs and functional bindings among neuron cells; 5. cellular, the set of brain cells, particularly neurons; 6. molecular, the chemical components that mediate the transmission of information. In this fashion, the second requisite to uphold the emergence of consciousness lies in establishing that the different levels of brain organization constitute a pyramidal arrangement. Certainly, the number of elements is greater in the lower levels, while the integration of information is progressively enhanced in the upper levels. Moreover, this neuropychological pyramid insinuates both an ascending cascade whereby the lower orders stipulate and influence the upper ones, and a progressive and convergent functional enrichment ultimately resulting in the qualia, feeling, and awareness attributes of consciousness. Information flows horizontally in each level, but it also overflows vertically in both directions. This pyramidal scheme is applied to clarify two particular aspects of brain function that are closely linked to consciousness: the electrical activity and the engram of memory. Such inquiry makes clear that a qualitative jump manifested by the emergence of various and dissimilar novelties occur at each layer of brain operation based upon a mass coordination. It seems feasible to envision the engram, and conceivably every other mental representation, as a plastic pattern involving all levels and aspects of brain operation, including the pinnacle where consciousness consolidates as the subjective aspect of the uppermost brain function. As a result of the proposed stratified and pyramidal scheme of brain functions, the first hypotheses is strengthened and specified. Thus, presumably consciousness and the neural capacities correlated to it constitute two associated aspects emerging from such particular functional hierarchy at the organic level of the brain by the efficient connection of its modules. It would not be required that all the modules of the brain became interrelated during a conscious processing, but that they would be functionally available instead, while some of them become progressively active by intermodular articulation, thereby making possible the arising and unfolding of conscious mental operation streams. In order to reinforce this notion, the visual system is invoked since the consciously perceived scene emerges from the coordination of some 40 modules that separately appear to operate unconsciously. At the moment that such high-hierarchy and complex function presumably appears, it would achieve a conscious correlate and become altogether able to exert a descending causality and supervene the operation of the lower orders, which, among other capacities, would permit voluntary action to take place. In order to specify the first hypothesis, asserting that consciousness emerges at the organic level of the brain along with the proficient intermodular connectivity, a second hypothesis is formulated and justified in neuroanatomical, neurophysiological, and complex scientific terms. The supposition is that the specific neural correlate of consciousness may be a function similar to a bird flock or an insect swarm orderly binding the operations of different modules in a cinematic, hipercomplex, coherent, and synchronic stream. The human brain contains some 400 cortical and subcortical modules functioning as partially specialized stations that potentially interchange particularly codified information through some 2500 fibers or intermodular pathways. The hypothesis requires information complexity undergoing a further and substantial gain of attributions through the concise and prolific connectivity of the different modules. In this regard, it is supposed that a stream of coherent activation is constituted in the conscious brain by the intermodular dynamics and that such dynamics may acquire global patterned properties in a similar way as bird flocks and so-called intelligent swarms achieve unanimously shifting dynamics. This particular idea is supported with complex scientific models of the remarkable performances of large groups of birds and insects and with the known behavior of massive populations of neurons. In so far as this would be a complex function operating at the limits of equilibrium resulting from local dynamics of the brain subsystems, the self-organization of high level brain functions justifies the notion that a dynamic coupling among modules may result in complex cognitive properties and consciousness. Intermodular brain dynamics is conceived here as an emergent, unbound, synchronic, hypercomplex, highly coherent, and tetradimensional process capable to navigate, steer, swirl, split, and flow throughout the brain and thereby connect very diverse systems in a fast and efficient manner. In the same way, its putative subjective correlate -the conscious process- may be conceived as an emergent, voluntary, unified, qualitative, and narrative process capable to access, coordinate, and integrate multiple local information mechanisms. The hypothesis poses that the conscious transformation of information is correlated, moment to moment and point to point, with the intermodular processing that evolves in the manner or a bird flock or swarm dynamics. It is finally posed that brain intermodular dynamics correlated to consciousness consolidates by the convergence of an ascending bottom-up organization of the different ranks of brain operation, and by the descending top-down influx or the social, cultural, and environmental information where the individual is immersed.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022869","afid":"60022869","affilname":"Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Facultad de Medicina","affiliation-city":"Mexico","affiliation-country":"Mexico"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"re","subtypeDescription":"Review","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56473221100","authid":"56473221100","authname":"Díaz J.L.","surname":"Díaz","given-name":"José Luis","initials":"J.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022869"}]}],"authkeywords":"Brain | Brain connectivity | Brain correlate of consciousness | Brain functional hierarchy | Brain modularity | Consciousness | Dual aspect theory | Dynamical systems | Emergence","source-id":"19332","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33644880492"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33644880492?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33644880492&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33644880492&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33644880492","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:33644880492","eid":"2-s2.0-33644880492","dc:title":"Novel quaternion Kalman filter","dc:creator":"Choukroun D.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","prism:issn":"00189251","prism:volume":"42","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"174-190","prism:coverDate":"2006-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"January 2006","prism:doi":"10.1109/TAES.2006.1603413","dc:description":"This paper presents a novel Kalman filter (KF) for estimating the attitude-quaternion as well as gyro random drifts from vector measurements. Employing a special manipulation on the measurement equation results in a linear pseudo-measurement equation whose error is state-dependent. Because the quaternion kinematics equation is linear, the combination of the two yields a linear KF that eliminates the usual linearization procedure and is less sensitive to initial estimation errors. General accurate expressions for the covariance matrices of the system state-dependent noises are developed. In addition, an analysis shows how to compute these covariance matrices efficiently. An adaptive version of the filter is also developed to handle modeling errors of the dynamic system noise statistics. Monte-Carlo simulations are carried out that demonstrate the efficiency of both versions of the filter. In the particular case of high initial estimation errors, a typical extended Kalman filter (EKF) fails to converge whereas the proposed filter succeeds. © 2006 IEEE.","citedby-count":"336","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027550","afid":"60027550","affilname":"University of California, Los Angeles","affiliation-city":"Los Angeles","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022403","afid":"60022403","affilname":"Technion - Israel Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Haifa","affiliation-country":"Israel"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12778249200","authid":"12778249200","authname":"Choukroun D.","surname":"Choukroun","given-name":"Daniel","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027550"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005800275","authid":"7005800275","authname":"Bar-Itzhack I.Y.","surname":"Bar-Itzhack","given-name":"Itzhack Y.","initials":"I.Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022403"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004302312","authid":"7004302312","authname":"Oshman Y.","surname":"Oshman","given-name":"Yaakov","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022403"}]}],"source-id":"17336","fund-acr":"GSFC","fund-no":"NAG5-8770","fund-sponsor":"Goddard Space Flight Center","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33144488247"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33144488247?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33144488247&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33144488247&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33144488247","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:33144488247","eid":"2-s2.0-33144488247","dc:title":"The theory and use of the quaternion wavelet transform","dc:creator":"Bayro-Corrochano E.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision","prism:issn":"09249907","prism:volume":"24","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"19-35","prism:coverDate":"2006-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"January 2006","prism:doi":"10.1007/s10851-005-3605-3","dc:description":"This paper presents the theory and practicalities of the quaternion wavelet transform (QWT).

In this paper, we present a complete, autonomous, and movable-on-demand localization system. It is based on the estimation of the direction of arrival of signals emitted by mobile sources, impinging on an array of sensors placed on board a mobile localization station, represented by any aerial or terrestrial vehicle. The system is especially tailored for wireless users unable to perform self-localization, and its most attractive characteristic is its inherent mobility, which allows a quick employment \"on demand,\" in emergency situations, where other localization infrastructures are not present or are unable to properly operate. Procedures of autolocalization and autoorientation of the localization station, based on a set of emitting sources in known location, are considered as well. The user to be located should only be equipped with a very simple radio transmitter, whose signal can be received and identified by the localization station. Alternatively, in more sophisticated scenarios, the user's equipment can be a personal mobile phone, seamlessly connected with the localization station acting as a temporary base station. The performance of the overall system has been evaluated for a case of code division multiple access (CDMA)-based transceiver via computer simulations, showing that the achievable accuracy for locating the user position can fulfill the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) E-911 standard requirements for emergency calls over reasonably wide coverage areas. © 2006 IEEE.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012162","afid":"60012162","affilname":"Politecnico di Torino","affiliation-city":"Turin","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602324266","authid":"6602324266","authname":"Falletti E.","surname":"Falletti","given-name":"Emanuela","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012162"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003764884","authid":"7003764884","authname":"Lo Presti L.","surname":"Lo Presti","given-name":"Letizia","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012162"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602523171","authid":"6602523171","authname":"Sellone F.","surname":"Sellone","given-name":"Fabrizio","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012162"}]}],"authkeywords":"Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation | Localization | Position location | Quaternions | Smart antennas","source-id":"17393","fund-no":"IST-2003-506745","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/32144452227"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/32144452227?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=32144452227&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=32144452227&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/32144452227","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:32144452227","eid":"2-s2.0-32144452227","dc:title":"Quaternion diffusion for color image filtering","dc:creator":"Liu Z.X.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Computer Science and Technology","prism:issn":"10009000","prism:volume":"21","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"126-136","prism:coverDate":"2006-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"January 2006","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11390-006-0126-5","dc:description":"How to combine color and multiscale information is a fundamental question for computer vision, and quite a few color diffusion techniques have been presented.
