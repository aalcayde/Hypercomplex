This restriction enables one to compute the spatial orientation of a given corner and its motion from its image in terms of polar coordinates, Eulerian angles, and quaternions. One can also interpret the shape and the face adjacency from local information only. The necessary constraints are listed, and some examples are given to compare the presented scheme to existing ones. The possible nonuniqueness of the interpretation is also discussed.

The object is assumed to be rigid, and its motion is assumed to be 'smooth'. Motion is modeled by retaining an arbitrary number of terms in the appropriate Taylor series expansions. Translational motion involves a standard rectilinear model, while rotational motion is described with quaternions. Neglected terms of the Taylor series are modeled as process noise in the recursive formulation. Observation of object features involves object structure parameters. A state-space model is constructed, incorporating both kinematic and structural states, and is appropriate for solution by either recursive or batch techniques. A set of object match points is assumed to be available, consisting of fixed features on the object, the image plane coordinates of which have been extracted from successive images in the sequence. The measured data are the noisy image plane coordinates of this set (or of a subset of this set) of object match points, taken from each image in the sequence. High noise levels (up to 20% of the object image size) are allowed. The problem is formulated as a parameter estimation and tracking problem, which can use an arbitrarily large number of images in a sequence.","citedby-count":"23","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029311","afid":"60029311","affilname":"University of Southern California","affiliation-city":"Los Angeles","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602885676","authid":"6602885676","authname":"Broida T.J.","surname":"Broida","given-name":"Ted J.","initials":"T.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029311"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203078416","authid":"57203078416","authname":"Chellappa R.","surname":"Chellappa","given-name":"Rama","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029311"}]}],"source-id":"131343","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
