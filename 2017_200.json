Five healthy young adults were asked to perform a set of movements using two sensors placed on the upper arm and forearm. Reference data were obtained from three therapists. The goal of the study is to determine an intra and inter-group difference between a number of given movements performed by young people with respect to the movements of therapists. This effort is directed toward studying other groups characterized by motion impairments, and it is relevant to obtain a quantified measure of the quality of movement of a patient to follow his/her recovery. The sensor signals were processed by applying two approaches, time-domain features and similarity distance between each pair of signals. The data analysis was divided into classification and variability using features and distances calculated previously. The classification analysis was made to determine if the movements performed by the test subjects of both groups are distinguishable among them. The variability analysis was conducted to measure the similarity of the movements. According to the results, the flexion/extension movement had a high intra-group variability. In addition, meaningful information were provided in terms of change of velocity and rotational motions for each individual.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030699","afid":"60030699","affilname":"Instituto Nacional de Astrofisica Optica y Electronica","affiliation-city":"Puebla","affiliation-country":"Mexico"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005803","afid":"60005803","affilname":"Boğaziçi Üniversitesi","affiliation-city":"Bebek","affiliation-country":"Turkey"}],"pubmed-id":"27848176","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36668919900","authid":"36668919900","authname":"López-Nava I.","surname":"López-Nava","given-name":"Irvin Hussein","initials":"I.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030699"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603173591","authid":"6603173591","authname":"Arnrich B.","surname":"Arnrich","given-name":"Bert","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005803"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26433712500","authid":"26433712500","authname":"Muñoz-Meléndez A.","surname":"Muñoz-Meléndez","given-name":"Angélica","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030699"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55903039300","authid":"55903039300","authname":"Güneysu A.","surname":"Güneysu","given-name":"Arzu","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005803"}]}],"authkeywords":"Acceleration signals | Inertial sensors | Quaternions | Therapeutic movements | Wearable sensors","article-number":"7","source-id":"23710","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84994409120"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84994409120?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84994409120&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84994409120&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84994409120","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84994409120","eid":"2-s2.0-84994409120","dc:title":"Upward continuation of Dome-C airborne gravity and comparison with GOCE gradients at orbit altitude in east Antarctica","dc:creator":"Yildiz H.","prism:publicationName":"Studia Geophysica et Geodaetica","prism:issn":"00393169","prism:eIssn":"15731626","prism:volume":"61","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"53-68","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 January 2017","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11200-015-0634-2","dc:description":"An airborne gravity campaign was carried out at the Dome-C survey area in East Antarctica between the 17th and 22nd of January 2013, in order to provide data for an experiment to validate GOCE satellite gravity gradients. After typical filtering for airborne gravity data, the cross-over error statistics for the few crossing points are 11.3 mGal root mean square (rms) error, corresponding to an rms line error of 8.0 mGal. This number is relatively large due to the rough flight conditions, short lines and field handling procedures used. Comparison of the airborne gravity data with GOCE RL4 spherical harmonic models confirmed the quality of the airborne data and that they contain more high-frequency signal than the global models. First, the airborne gravity data were upward continued to GOCE altitude to predict gravity gradients in the local North-East-Up reference frame. In this step, the least squares collocation using the ITGGRACE2010S field to degree and order 90 as reference field, which is subtracted from both the airborne gravity and GOCE gravity gradients, was applied. Then, the predicted gradients were rotated to the gradiometer reference frame using level 1 attitude quaternion data. The validation with the airborne gravity data was limited to the accurate gradient anomalies (TXX, TYY, TZZ and TXZ) where the long-wavelength information of the GOCE gradients has been replaced with GOCO03s signal to avoid contamination with GOCE gradient errors at these wavelengths. The comparison shows standard deviations between the predicted and GOCE gradient anomalies TXX, TYY, TZZ and TXZ of 9.9, 11.5, 11.6 and 10.4 mE, respectively. A more precise airborne gravity survey of the southern polar gap which is not observed by GOCE would thus provide gradient predictions at a better accuracy, complementing the GOCE coverage in this region.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023131","afid":"60023131","affilname":"Alfred-Wegener-Institut Helmholtz-Zentrum für Polar- und Meeresforschung","affiliation-city":"Bremerhaven","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60019722","afid":"60019722","affilname":"Technische Universität München","affiliation-city":"Munich","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017041","afid":"60017041","affilname":"Niels Bohr Institutet","affiliation-city":"Copenhagen","affiliation-country":"Denmark"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60011373","afid":"60011373","affilname":"Technical University of Denmark","affiliation-city":"Lyngby","affiliation-country":"Denmark"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100566339","afid":"100566339","affilname":"Geodesy Department","affiliation-city":"Ankara","affiliation-country":"Turkey"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23669738800","authid":"23669738800","authname":"Yildiz H.","surname":"Yildiz","given-name":"Hasan","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"100566339"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55916752500","authid":"55916752500","authname":"Forsberg R.","surname":"Forsberg","given-name":"Rene","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60011373"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603791129","authid":"6603791129","authname":"Tscherning C.C.","surname":"Tscherning","given-name":"Carl Christian","initials":"C.C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017041"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602644886","authid":"6602644886","authname":"Steinhage D.","surname":"Steinhage","given-name":"Daniel","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023131"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8603484100","authid":"8603484100","authname":"Eagles G.","surname":"Eagles","given-name":"Graeme","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023131"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701523200","authid":"6701523200","authname":"Bouman J.","surname":"Bouman","given-name":"Johannes","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60019722"}]}],"authkeywords":"airborne gravity | GOCE gravity gradients | upward continuation","source-id":"28971","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false,"freetoread":{"value": [{"$" :"all"},{"$" :"repository"},{"$" :"repositoryam"}]},"freetoreadLabel":{"value": [{"$" :"All Open Access"},{"$" :"Green"}]}},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84993958609"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84993958609?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84993958609&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84993958609&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0094114X16302762"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84993958609","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84993958609","eid":"2-s2.0-84993958609","dc:title":"Identification and geometric characterization of Lie triple screw systems and their exponential images","dc:creator":"Wu Y.","prism:publicationName":"Mechanism and Machine Theory","prism:issn":"0094114X","prism:volume":"107","prism:pageRange":"305-323","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 January 2017","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2016.09.020","pii":"S0094114X16302762","dc:description":"The twist space of a plunging constant-velocity (CV) coupling with intersecting shafts consists, in all configurations, of a planar field of zero-pitch screws.

In this paper, we first give a geometric characterization of the Lie product and the Lie triple product of a generic screw system. Then, we present a systematic identification of all Lie triple screw systems of se(3), by an approach based on both algebraic Lie group theory and descriptive screw theory.

There are relationship between Wigner distribution and ambiguity function. But, these relations are only suitable for complex-valued signals, and have not been investigated in quaternion linear canonical transforms. The purpose of this paper is to propose an equivalent relationship for the quaternion Wigner distribution and quaternion ambiguity function in the QLCT setting. First, we propose the 2D quaternion Wigner distribution (QLWD) and quaternion ambiguity function associated with the QLCT. Next, the relationship between these two novel concepts are derived. Moreover, the connection with the corresponding analytic signal are investigated. Examples with bandpass analytic signal illustrate the features of the proposed distributions. Finally a novel algorithm for the detection of quaternion-valued linear frequency-modulated signal is presented by using the proposed QLWD.","citedby-count":"30","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022317","afid":"60022317","affilname":"University of Macau","affiliation-city":"Taipa","affiliation-country":"Macao"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005816","afid":"60005816","affilname":"South China Normal University","affiliation-city":"Guangzhou","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190170675","authid":"57190170675","authname":"Fan X.L.","surname":"Fan","given-name":"Xiang Li","initials":"X.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005816"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003837546","authid":"7003837546","authname":"Kou K.I.","surname":"Kou","given-name":"Kit Ian","initials":"K.I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022317"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55743438800","authid":"55743438800","authname":"Liu M.S.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Ming Sheng","initials":"M.S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005816"}]}],"authkeywords":"2D quaternion Wigner–Ville distribution | Linear frequency modulation | Quaternion ambiguity function | Quaternion linear canonical transform","source-id":"25548","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"11401606","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84954491531"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84954491531?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84954491531&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84954491531&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84954491531","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84954491531","eid":"2-s2.0-84954491531","dc:title":"Robust hashing for image authentication using SIFT feature and quaternion Zernike moments","dc:creator":"Ouyang J.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","prism:issn":"13807501","prism:eIssn":"15737721","prism:volume":"76","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"2609-2626","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 January 2017","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11042-015-3225-x","dc:description":"A novel robust image hashing scheme based on quaternion Zernike moments (QZMs) and the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) is proposed for image authentication.

These experiments show that the proposed scheme provides a short hash length that is robust to most common image content-preserving manipulations like large angle rotations, and allows us to correctly locating forged image regions as well as detecting types of forgery image.","citedby-count":"40","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024617","afid":"60024617","affilname":"Hunan University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Xiangtan","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005244","afid":"60005244","affilname":"Southeast University","affiliation-city":"Nanjing","affiliation-country":"China"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/105141997","afid":"105141997","affilname":"Centre de Recherche en Information Biomedicale Sino-Francais (LIA CRIBs)","affiliation-city":"Rennes","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55446539500","authid":"55446539500","authname":"Ouyang J.","surname":"Ouyang","given-name":"Junlin","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024617"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024617"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35230208000","authid":"35230208000","authname":"Liu Y.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Yizhi","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024617"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024617"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7203086899","authid":"7203086899","authname":"Shu H.","surname":"Shu","given-name":"Huazhong","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005244"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"105141997"}]}],"authkeywords":"Forgery image localization | Image authentication | Quaternion Zernike moments | Robust image hashing | SIFT","source-id":"25627","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"14K037","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84948688429"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84948688429?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84948688429&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84948688429&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84948688429","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84948688429","eid":"2-s2.0-84948688429","dc:title":"A near-duplicate 3D video detection algorithm by using hypercomplex representations","dc:creator":"Sun Z.","prism:publicationName":"Multimedia Tools and Applications","prism:issn":"13807501","prism:eIssn":"15737721","prism:volume":"76","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"1055-1071","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 January 2017","prism:doi":"10.1007/s11042-015-3086-3","dc:description":"Copyright protection is still a crucial open issue in the 3D video industry with the development of 3DTV coupled with the increasing 3D video spread over the internet. In this paper a novel video fingerprinting is proposed for near-duplicate 3D video detection. Instead of generating fingerprints from the color frames and the depth maps separately, the proposed algorithm processes them in a holistic manner. The hypercomplex representation developed from the RGB and depth components is used to represent the 3D contents as quaternion frames and a novel quaternion centroid of the spatio-temporal gradient orientations is exploited to generate 3D video fingerprints based on these quaternion frames. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, and the results show that the proposed near-duplicate 3D video detection algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of robustness and discrimination. And the proposed fingerprints are also more compact than the existing approaches.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60014966","afid":"60014966","affilname":"Peking University","affiliation-city":"Beijing","affiliation-country":"China"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/46761463100","authid":"46761463100","authname":"Sun Z.","surname":"Sun","given-name":"Ziqiang","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014966"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55453293800","authid":"55453293800","authname":"Zhu Y.","surname":"Zhu","given-name":"Yuesheng","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014966"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56982380700","authid":"56982380700","authname":"Xing X.","surname":"Xing","given-name":"Xiaomei","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014966"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55545955200","authid":"55545955200","authname":"Luo G.","surname":"Luo","given-name":"Guibo","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014966"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57095810500","authid":"57095810500","authname":"Liu X.","surname":"Liu","given-name":"Xiyao","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60014966"}]}],"authkeywords":"Hypercomplex representation | Near-duplicate 3D video detection | Quaternion | Video fingerprint","source-id":"25627","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
